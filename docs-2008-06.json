This project has two main contributions. The first contribution is a low-level interpretation and compression substrate over RFID streams. This substrate offers accurate interpretation of incomplete and noisy raw data; it infers locations of unobserved objects and inter-object relationships using probabilistic algorithms. To handle high data volume, it performs online interpretation, enabling online compression by identifying and discarding redundant data. The second contribution is higher-level complex event processing that addresses the data-information mismatch by encoding application information needs as event patterns and evaluating these patterns continuously over event streams. This project offers a foundation for complex event processing with a compact, expressive event language, theoretical underpinnings, automata-based mechanisms for efficient pattern evaluation over event streams, and techniques for robust processing over event streams that result from low-level interpretation and compression. This project integrates research and education through curriculum development and teaching and research lab development, and enables broader participation of women and minorities in research through college outreach and CRA?s distributed mentor program.

Current learning methods employ representations that make it difficult to encode simplification and specific examples, and learning is based on random exploration that is difficult to direct. NEAT is a learning system where the learned decision policy is represented in neural networks and learned through evolutionary optimization, i.e. genetic algorithms. NEAT evolves network structure as well as weights, which makes it possible in principle to incorporate human guidance in three ways: (1) building a gradually more complex network structure through shaping from simple to more complex tasks, (2) training networks with examples of human behavior, and (3) converting human-designed rules into network structures. These techniques will be developed and evaluated in the domain of designing complex behaviors for autonomous agents in the NERO 3D simulation environment. In a series of human subject experiments, the solutions designed through human-guided neuroevolution will be compared to those designed by human engineers and to those discovered by neuroevolution alone, verifying that (a) the human-guided approach results in better solutions, and (b) those solutions are more creative. The result of this project is a machine learning approach will allow engineers to generate creative designs to many real-world sequential decision problems. Applications of this approach will lead to safer and more efficient vehicle, traffic, and robotic control, improved process and manufacturing optimization, and more efficient computer and communication systems. It will also make the next generation of video games possible, with characters that exhibit realistic and adaptive behaviors; such technology should lead to more effective educational and training games in the future.","title":"Pilot: Leveraging Human Creativity with Machine Discovery","awardID":"0757479","effectiveDate":"2008-06-01","expirationDate":"2011-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7788","name":"CreativeIT"}}],"PIcoPI":["408627"],"PO":["424970"]},"142880":{"abstract":"The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) is the recipient of an award for summer internship support.

ASL is a distinct language from English; in fact, a majority of deaf U.S. high school graduates have only a fourth-grade (age 10) English reading level. Consequently, many deaf people find it difficult to read English text on computers, in TV captioning, or in other settings. Software to translate English text into an animation of a human character performing ASL would make more information and services accessible to deaf Americans. Unfortunately, however, essential aspects of ASL are not yet modeled by modern computational linguistic software. Specifically, ASL signers associate entities under discussion with 3D locations around their bodies, and the movement of many types of ASL signs changes based on these locations: pronouns, determiners, many noun phrases, many types of verbs, and others. When do signers associate entities under discussion with locations in space? Where do they position them? How must ASL sign movements be modified based on their arrangement? Creation of robust software to understand or generate ASL requires answers to questions such as these. The PI's goal in this research is to discover techniques for generation of ASL animations that automatically predict when to associate conversation topics with 3D locations, where to place them, and how these locations affect ASL sign movements. To these ends, he will create the first annotated corpus of ASL movement data from native signers (in a motion-capture suit and gloves), annotate this corpus with features relating to the establishment of entity-representing locations in space, use machine learning approaches to analyze when\/where these locations are established and how 3D motion paths of signs are parameterized on those locations, incorporate the models into ASL generation software, and recruit native ASL signers to evaluate the 3D animations that result. This work will advance our linguistic knowledge relating to little-understood yet frequent ASL phenomena, and so will lay the foundation for software to produce a huge variety of ASL signs and constructions that are beyond the ability of current techniques to generate. This will in turn lead to ASL generation systems that produce higher quality animations that are more grammatical and understandable to deaf users, which will greatly benefit accessibility applications for deaf users and ASL machine translation. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: The ASL motion-capture corpus and an ASL generator that automatically handles spatial phenomena will enable more computational linguistic researchers to study ASL. This research also has applications for sign languages used in other countries (most with similar phenomena), and for the generation of animations of human gestures (for which empirical techniques developed in this work will apply). The PI is committed to finding ways to encourage deaf high school students to pursue science careers, and to creating Ph.D. research opportunities for deaf students. He will give presentations in ASL at local deaf high schools about computing research, make available summer research experiences for deaf high school students (using ASL skills to annotate the corpus, conduct evaluation studies, and inform the Deaf community about computing), recruit native ASL signers as Ph.D. and undergraduate researchers, and create courses on people-focused computer science research and careers (to attract diverse students to the field) and on assistive technology research (to interest and train Ph.D. students). These educational activities will be enabled by the PI's conversational ASL skills, by the research's relevance to deaf students, and by the Queens College's unique proximity to five local high schools for deaf students.","title":"CAREER: Learning to Generate American Sign Language Animation through Motion-Capture and Participation of Native ASL Signers","awardID":"0746556","effectiveDate":"2008-06-01","expirationDate":"2013-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["475201"],"PO":["565227"]},"144101":{"abstract":"SGER: Reconstructing the Tower of Babel: Cross-lingual Language Learning<br\/><br\/>Today, there are more than 6,000 living languages in the world.

One of the greatest contrasts between the biological organisms and human technology lies in how they are constructed. Plants and animals grow from the inside out, often from a single cell to an organism containing billions of cells, each of which is built from molecular components that are manufactured with atomic precision within the cell. In contrast, mankind's greatest engineering marvels, such as airplanes and skyscrapers and computers, are put together from the outside in, with components being manufactured in factories and assembled piece by piece. This distinction is often referred to as \"bottom-up\" vs \"top-down\" assembly in the biological \"bottom-up\" approach, the assembly process is guided by the components themselves, while in the engineering \"top-down\" approach, there is an entity conceptually above the object being built that supervises and guides the manufacturing process. Human engineering has mastered top-down methods to create systems of great complexity (but has not extended them to the atomic and molecular scale) and has exploited bottom-up methods for the synthesis of diverse molecular, polymeric and crystalline structures (but has not created information-rich structures of great complexity). <br\/>Project Goals. Our goal is to demonstrate how bottom-up techniques can create complex atomically-defined structures, as biology does, by embedding information and computational processes within the molecules themselves. In biological development, a program (the genome) uses biochemistry to guide the growth process and determine the ultimate form of the organism. In the parlance of computer science, a system that can be programmed to accomplish any task that can be accomplished is called a \"universal\" system. A universal computer can be programmed to perform any computation, while a universal constructor can be programmed to carry out any construction task. Recent work has theoretically shown that universal molecular self-assembly is possible and has experimentally demonstrated that the approach shows promise, using DNA as a construction material to create functional molecular devices so-called \"DNA nanotechnology\". In this proposal, we aim to bring DNA nanotechnology to the point where universal bottom-up self-assembly can be achieved well enough that immediate technological applications can be demonstrated. <br\/>Specific Aims. We aim to make major advances both in our ability to program complex self-assembly logic and in our ability to interface the DNA structures to chemically-, optically-, and electronically-relevant materials. We will focus on four main goals, which span the range from long-term fundamental work to near-term development: (1) self-assembly of a template for a complex molecular-scale electronic circuit; (2) programming the behavior of molecular walking motors to transport components in nanofabrication tasks; (3) attaching carbon nanotube wires to create small nanoscale electronic circuits; and (4) integrating bottom-up and top-down fabrication by placing and orienting self-assembled components at target locations on silicon wafers with functional electrical contacts. <br\/>Uniquely, the aims of this research require simultaneously development of two novel computing systems: the first, inspired by biological self-assembly and development, operates at the level of molecular machines and biochemistry, and will be programmed to construct the second, composed of carbon nanotubes assembled into nanoscale circuits, which operates at the electrical level like conventional computing devices.<br\/>Broader Impact. An important aspect of this project will be the training of young scientists (undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs) capable of spanning the interdisciplinary subjects involved in this work.","title":"Nano: Collaborative Research: EMT : Toward Universal Bottom-Up Nanofabrication with DNA","awardID":"0855212","effectiveDate":"2008-06-23","expirationDate":"2010-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7353","name":"EMERGING MODELS & TECHNOLOGIES"}}],"PIcoPI":["449857"],"PO":["565223"]},"133024":{"abstract":"The University of South Dakota (USD), partnering with Sinte Gleska University (SGU) and the U.S. Geological Survey?s Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS), proposes to engage more Native Americans in computing through the Getting American Indians to Information Technology (GAIN-IT) project.

One area of creative endeavor of great cultural and economic importance is music. In recent decades, a vast variety of audio production tools have been introduced to enhance and facilitate music creation. Unfortunately, since the tools come from software developers more familiar with Java than musical creativity, many of these tools are extremely complex and use concepts and controllers very different from those that musicians are accustomed to and comfortable with. Since the tools are complex, and interfaces to software suites change every few years, musicians may fail to embrace them or only ?half- learn? them, inhibiting creativity and limiting the range of possible works produced, and the ultimate capacity that powerful technology has to enhance musical creation. Many musicians think about sound in individualistic terms that may not have known mappings onto the controls of existing audio production tools. For example, a violinist may want to make the recording of her violin sound shimmery. While she has a clear concept of what a shimmery sound is, she may not know how to articulate it in terms that let a producer map shimmery onto the available audio tools (such as reverberation and equalization). This project develops a computational tool that works alongside the musician to quickly learn how acoustic features map onto an audio concept, and creates a simple controller to manipulate audio in terms of that concept. In the case of the violin player, the tool would learn what shimmery means to her, and then create a knob that would let her make a sound more or less shimmery. This project uses a user-centered design approach to the development of audio production tools that automatically adapts to the user?s work style, rather than forcing the user to adapt to the tools. The result will be and example of how audio tools can enhance creativity, and more broadly, how affective concepts can be automatically mapped to more discrete parameters associated with digital media production.","title":"Collaborative Research: Pilot: Personalized Tools to Enhance Musical Creativity","awardID":"0757544","effectiveDate":"2008-06-15","expirationDate":"2012-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7788","name":"CreativeIT"}}],"PIcoPI":["562931","485732"],"PO":["565227"]},"141011":{"abstract":"Proposals 0820217\/0819987<br\/><br\/>Enhancing the Reliability of Bioinformatics Software by Correlating User Feedback and Execution Data<br\/><br\/>PIs: Andy Podgurski and Wassim Masri<br\/><br\/>A neglected consequence of the proliferation of scientific data sets and computational services on the Internet is that the scientific community is becoming increasingly dependent on the quality of shared data sets and the reliability of the software used to analyze them.

However, support for the more difficult challenges of information seeking is not provided by the current search engines. There are only a few models of human behavior or practical support tools for open-ended, exploratory, discovery-oriented, or recall-oriented tasks that depend as much on results examination and interpretation as on query specification. Meeting the needs of people who seek information to discover and learn is a grand challenge, and the tools and services needed to meet this challenge will be fundamental to the emerging cyberinfrastructure. The time and conditions are right to develop the theory, techniques, and tools to support such information seeking needs. This two-day workshop aims to bring together leaders in information retrieval, library and information science, and human-computer interaction to shape the short- and long-term agenda for research to support information seeking. In particular the workshop focuses on the following three themes: (i) Understanding \/ modeling exploratory search behavior; (ii) Providing system support for exploratory search; and (iii) Evaluating systems to support exploratory search. <br\/><br\/>This workshop will have impact on the emerging information seeking research and development community by defining directions for short, mid, and long-term research. Workshop results will be widely disseminated via the workshop website (http:\/\/www.ils.unc.edu\/ISSS_workshop\/).

Tools that find errors automatically and reliably are essential to ensure engineering of correct software. Automata theory has had a great impact in hardware verification, where it forms the basis of model-checking systems against temporal logics. This project leverages automata-theoretic methods to the field of software verification. Automata theory provides several strikingly new mechanisms for verifying software, including handling of complex control flows of recursion and concurrency, and bridging logical specifications to verification algorithms.<br\/>The project will develop these mechanisms and apply them to solve key problems in the following areas of software verification:<br\/>- Developing temporal logics for specifying complex event sequence properties of recursive programs;<br\/>- Checking atomicity violations in concurrent programs using automata-based monitoring; and<br\/>- Verifying heap properties of programs manipulating dynamic data, using a novel automata based abstraction.<br\/>In addition, two tools will be developed: one monitors concurrent programs for atomicity violations, and the second implements an abstraction framework to verify heap-intensive programs. The techniques developed will pave innovative pathways into the fundamental problems of analyzing software. The techniques will have immediate impact on analysis tools built and used in the software industry, and significantly advance the landscape of software verification.","title":"CAREER: The Automata Theoretic Method in Software Verification","awardID":"0747041","effectiveDate":"2008-06-15","expirationDate":"2013-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["497077"],"PO":["565264"]},"134445":{"abstract":"Wireless Internet streaming is hindered by a number of obstacles that are rooted from limited available resources on wireless devices.

Furthermore, idle peer computing resources are being utilized and novel distributed online content adaptation schemes are being designed to address multi-dimensional heterogeneity of wireless devices. In addition, the unused covert communication channel and application characteristics are being exploited to design a set of new security protection schemes to satisfy the demand of future wireless Internet streaming services.<br\/><br\/>The efficient Internet resource management techniques to be developed through this CAREER project are expected to address these critical issues in wireless Internet streaming and to enable pervasive and high-quality wireless Internet streaming accesses a reality.","title":"CAREER: Internet Resource Management to Deliver High Quality Live and On-demand Streaming for Wireless Clients","awardID":"0746649","effectiveDate":"2008-06-01","expirationDate":"2013-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["486233"],"PO":["565303"]},"134456":{"abstract":"Abstract<br\/>Acquiring Computer Graphics Models of Human Shape and Motion<br\/>James Davis, UC Santa Cruz<br\/><br\/><br\/>This research is developing algorithms to measure human body shape and motion to 1mm and 1deg accuracy without placing \"fiducials\" (i.e., markers) on the person's body.

The first part of this research considers the practical computation of information-theoretic quantities, such as the capacity and the error exponent, that are important for the design of magnetic storage devices with very low failure rates. The second part involves the joint iterative decoding for FSCs and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. In particular, this work considers a pseudo-codeword analysis for joint decoding that can be used to optimize codes for finite block lengths.

This research is developing mathematical formulations for the quantification, propagation, and aggregation of such data to support collaborative reasoning using visual means.

Both data collection and transformation steps, however, incur certain degrees of uncertainty, some due to the transformations, and others inherently present in the source data.

In nanometer technologies, the frequency of soft errors affects the markets of consumer electronics and networking, not just aerospace or military applications. This research aims to develop mitigation strategies that reduce the overall soft error rate while minimizing traditional cost metrics such as silicon area, power consumption, and performance degradation. Both technology scaling and system complexity have motivated designers to rely upon cell libraries and reusable cores in their design flow. This work investigates the fundamental fault generation and fault transport of radiation-induced soft errors within those building blocks. By identifying the fundamental characteristics of soft errors, design principles can be developed to improve the starting point for reliability of all types of integrated circuits, from avionics and space applications to enterprise servers, network routers, and control systems. This work includes simulation of irradiated individual circuits as well as experimentation to analyze the full hardware implementation of a microprocessor. The research leverages and integrates traditional domains such as computer architecture, VLSI design, fault tolerance, and radiation effects. Another critical component of this effort is the recruitment and retention of students in science and engineering from traditionally underrepresented groups. The PI has partnered with the Tennessee Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program at Vanderbilt University to provide summer undergraduate research opportunities and professional development seminars to help students prepare for and succeed in graduate school.","title":"CAREER: An Integrated Approach to Soft Error Mitigation in CMOS Digital Systems","awardID":"0747042","effectiveDate":"2008-06-01","expirationDate":"2013-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":["549985"],"PO":["366560"]},"136602":{"abstract":"The growing power and flexibility of information technology has allowed developers to build increasingly creative tools; however that same capacity has often led to tools whose use is beyond any but the most expert power-user. One area of creative endeavor of great cultural and economic importance is music. In recent decades, a vast variety of audio production tools have been introduced to enhance and facilitate music creation. Unfortunately, since the tools come from software developers more familiar with Java than musical creativity, many of these tools are extremely complex and use concepts and controllers very different from those that musicians are accustomed to and comfortable with. Since the tools are complex, and interfaces to software suites change every few years, musicians may fail to embrace them or only ?half- learn? them, inhibiting creativity and limiting the range of possible works produced, and the ultimate capacity that powerful technology has to enhance musical creation. Many musicians think about sound in individualistic terms that may not have known mappings onto the controls of existing audio production tools. For example, a violinist may want to make the recording of her violin sound shimmery. While she has a clear concept of what a shimmery sound is, she may not know how to articulate it in terms that let a producer map shimmery onto the available audio tools (such as reverberation and equalization). This project develops a computational tool that works alongside the musician to quickly learn how acoustic features map onto an audio concept, and creates a simple controller to manipulate audio in terms of that concept. In the case of the violin player, the tool would learn what shimmery means to her, and then create a knob that would let her make a sound more or less shimmery. This project uses a user-centered design approach to the development of audio production tools that automatically adapts to the user?s work style, rather than forcing the user to adapt to the tools. The result will be and example of how audio tools can enhance creativity, and more broadly, how affective concepts can be automatically mapped to more discrete parameters associated with digital media production.","title":"Collaborative Research: PILOT: Personalized Tools to Enhance Musical Creativity","awardID":"0757552","effectiveDate":"2008-06-15","expirationDate":"2011-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7788","name":"CreativeIT"}}],"PIcoPI":[362991],"PO":["565227"]},"134567":{"abstract":"Abstract<br\/><br\/>Title: Scalable Image Search and Recognition: Learning to Efficiently Leverage Incomplete Information<br\/>PI: Kristen Grauman<br\/>Institution: The University of Texas at Austin<br\/><br\/><br\/>As it becomes increasingly feasible to capture, transmit, and store image and video content on a large scale, the need for machine vision algorithms capable of interpreting it is undeniable. The opportunities appear vast, but progress towards large-scale visual recognition hinges on the development of computationally efficient methods that can effectively leverage minimal supervision.

The proposed technical plan calls for a combination of ideas from vision, learning, and algorithms. Scalable recognition and image search will affect the extent to which visual data can be accessed and mined, making this work relevant to other scientific disciplines where images capture vital information but currently lack proper tools for large-scale analysis.

In this project, the PI will investigate the role of facial expressions and head movements produced by a lifelike animated character with the goal of indicating important information in a story or the emotions of the characters. The PI's hypothesis is that stories in which the virtual storyteller emulates natural head movements and emotions will lead to increased engagement by subjects, more positive ratings of the storyteller, and better comprehension of the stories. To validate the hypothesis, the PI will conduct experiments in which she manipulates the head movements and facial emotions of a virtual storyteller, so as to emphasize specific speech intervals or to provide emotional expression through the storyteller?s voice. She will analyze videotapes of subjects listening to and looking at the storyteller to assess how attentive they are, and she will also employ questionnaires to measure the subjects? impressions of how believable, credible and human-like the virtual storyteller appears to be. She will further ask subjects to summarize the stories they heard, and will then analyze the summaries both for comprehension and for recollection of emotional content. By these means the PI expects to lay the foundation for a powerful new experimental approach for investigating engaging and effective communication by lifelike animated characters through speech, head movements and facial expression of emotions, and to derive important new insights about how voice and facial expressions can be combined in optimal ways to enable pedagogical agents to provide more believable and effective communication experiences.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This exploratory research will provide new insights and knowledge about the role of face and head gestures, and facial displays of emotion, on engagement and learning in intelligent tutoring programs that use lifelike pedagogical agents.

This project aims to make a fundamental alteration to the programming paradigm, to enable the creation of provably correct code at a reasonable cost. The project proposes to develop new programming languages where programs can be written with tightly integrated formal proofs of correctness. Proofs are data in the programming language, just like booleans or strings. Type checking ensures that if a function requires a proof of some fact (e.g., a pointer is not null) in order to operate correctly, such a proof is indeed supplied where the function is called. Functions may also produce proofs as part of their output. Technical problems that must be solved arise in supporting programming with proofs in the presence of mutable state (i.e., program variables whose values can change) and other effects. <br\/>Broader impacts of the proposed work include developing new languages for correct programming, together with publicly available prototype implementations; and the creation of new courses for graduate students<br\/>and advanced undergraduates incorporating the ideas of the research.

Consequently, supervised methods and many unsupervised methods cannot be applied directly, leaving these languages largely untouched and unnoticed. Another crucial issue, which has received little attention from the natural language processing (NLP) community, is that to date there have been very few studies that examine a large number of languages and incorporate cross-lingual information into NLP systems. As a result, languages are researched and processed in isolation rather than being looked at as part of a big language family.<br\/><br\/>This proposed research has two intertwined goals. The first goal is to create a framework that allows the rapid development of resources for resource-poor languages. This goal will be accomplished by bootstrapping NLP tools with initial seeds created by projecting syntactic information from resource-rich languages to resource-poor ones. The second goal is to use the automatically created resources to perform cross-lingual study on a large number of languages to discover linguistic knowledge. The knowledge will not only deepen our understanding on languages, but also provide additional information that can be incorporated into the bootstrapping module to produce better NLP tools. The research explores two key ideas: The first idea is to take advantage of resource-rich languages by using them to create seeds for bootstrapping NLP tools. The second idea is to identify the relation between languages and use this information to help machine learning. Both ideas point to the same direction; that is, languages are related to one another and should be treated as such.","title":"CAREER: Information Engineering and Synthesis for Resource-poor Languages","awardID":"0748919","effectiveDate":"2008-06-15","expirationDate":"2013-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0404","name":"Division of BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE SCI","abbr":"BCS"},"pgm":{"id":"1311","name":"LINGUISTICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["507284"],"PO":["565215"]},"134209":{"abstract":"Device drivers are a major source of complexity, unreliability, and cost for modern operating systems.

Managing evolution is one of the fundamental challenges of software engineering. During the design process many design decisions and trade-offs concerning functional and non-functional requirements must be considered. The process of abstracting requirements into models and converting those models into code yields design artifacts where decisions are documented?if at all?informally. To preserve design decisions through maintenance, the current research approach is to annotate architecture models with explicit representations of design decisions as first-class entities. Unfortunately, it is clear that we lack the instruments for evaluating the effectiveness of design decision modeling systems, for comparing these systems to each other, and for using these analyses to drive future research. To accomplish our research goals, we propose a course of empirical study that uses surveys, expert interviews, and talk-through protocol analysis as the basis for formulating a theory of maintenance design. The theory will be tested using experimentation by protocol analysis and validated through ethnography in real-world industrial contexts.","title":"Studying Design Intent for Software Evolution and Maintenance","awardID":"0820251","effectiveDate":"2008-06-15","expirationDate":"2013-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7724","name":"SOFTWARE FOR REAL-WORLD SYSTMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["486519",374822],"PO":["564388"]},"135409":{"abstract":"The proposed infrastructure acquisition and development will provide computing resources to enhance the ability of faculty and students in the PI's department to do computationally instensive research projects.

However, as such institutions strive to become more accessible to people with disabilities, they must find ways to accommodate an increasingly diverse visitor population with varying physical and sensory needs. Facilities that rely primarily on the visual experiences of their exhibits to promote educational and entertainment goals, for example, often find it challenging to enable meaningful participation by the millions of people who are blind or visually impaired. When exhibits are dynamic the problems are compounded, as movements and changes are often difficult to describe, and interactions hard to afford, to individuals who lack normal vision. The behavior of fish in an aquarium, the play of chimpanzees or lion cubs in a zoo habitat, and the cosmic dance of the planets in a science center?s model of the solar system are examples of dynamic exhibits that have until now been inaccessible to visitors with vision impairments. The ultimate goal of the PI in the Accessible Aquarium Project is to make such dynamic exhibits accessible and engaging for visitors with vision impairments, by providing real-time interpretations through the use of innovative tracking and audio technologies. The PI and his team hope to eventually develop cutting edge bio-tracking and behavior analysis techniques that can provide input for sophisticated, informative, and compelling multimedia auditory displays and sonifications (sounds used for the purpose of conveying information about some kind of data to a listener). Virtually every exhibit in an aquarium is dynamic; furthermore, the aquatic nature of these exhibits provides unique and interesting challenges to the use of typical sensing technologies and techniques for tracking. As a result, considerable innovation and new science will be required for the project to succeed. In this exploratory project the PI will assemble an end-to-end proof-of-concept system that involves a research aquarium with live fish, a camera-based bio-tracking system, an algorithmic music generation system, and a method\/interface for users to interact with the resulting audio service. Tracking and sonification algorithms will be developed and integrated, so that the movements of the fish can be used to generate music and other audio annotations. The resulting audio output will be presented to a range of sighted and visually impaired participants, and both objective performance and subjective data will be collected. An iterative design-evaluate-redesign process will allow the PI to rapidly and effectively improve the basic system, and provide a solid proof of concept. This will lead to a complete research platform that can later be used for more in-depth research in all of the constituent fields. The project will draw on the talent of efforts of, and derive inspiration from, a diverse group of researchers, students, and expert members of the community, including a great number of persons with visual impairments.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This project will advance knowledge in bio-tracking, behavior analysis, sonification, auditory displays, and computer music. While these advances will each be important in their respective fields, the synergy of the advancements in these various areas will open up a whole new world to people with vision impairments: the complex natural choreography of a dynamic aquatic environment. The findings will be applicable beyond aquaria to other kinds of facilities such as zoos and museums, and also beyond individuals with vision impairments to other groups of people such as seniors or those for whom mobility, height, or other problems make it hard to see traditional signage. Indeed, all visitors will benefit from an audio enhancement that allows them to learn about an exhibit while keeping their visual attention on the exhibit itself.","title":"SGER: Prototype Accessible Aquarium: Exploration of Advanced Bio-Tracking and Adaptive Sonification Infrastructure","awardID":"0833379","effectiveDate":"2008-06-15","expirationDate":"2009-11-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["436270","529975","561054",383396],"PO":["565227"]},"144606":{"abstract":"The High Performance Database Research Center at Florida International University is leveraging the Hadoop framework, which implements Google's computational paradigm MapReduce and provides distributed file system services, for serving geospatial imagery and to execute spatial queries with heterogeneous predicates.

The approach involves monitoring externalized data changes of individual service executions. Peer-to-peer, decentralized communication among process execution agents is then used to discover data dependencies among concurrently executing processes that may lead to data inconsistencies during the recovery of a failed process. Process interference rules of dependent processes are used to test user-defined semantic conditions to determine if 1) critical data conditions have been affected by the recovery of a failed process and 2) recovery procedures should be invoked for dependent processes. The research includes the development of a methodology for using process interference rules. The correctness and efficiency of decentralized data dependency analysis and rule-based recovery procedures are also demonstrated for concurrent processes in the context of a service composition model that supports compensation, contingency, rollback, and retry techniques. This research provides a new way of thinking about traditional transaction recoverability concepts, providing a dynamic approach to discovering data dependencies and responding to failures in a manner that guarantees user-defined correctness conditions for concurrent processes that execute without isolation guarantees.","title":"SRS: A Decentralized and Rule-Based Approach to Data Dependency Analysis and Failure Recovery in Service-Oriented Environments","awardID":"0820152","effectiveDate":"2008-06-15","expirationDate":"2012-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7724","name":"SOFTWARE FOR REAL-WORLD SYSTMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7944","name":"SOFTWARE ENG & FORMAL METHODS"}}],"PIcoPI":["553593"],"PO":["564388"]},"140977":{"abstract":"Proposal Number: 0820060<br\/><br\/>Title: SASSY: Self-Architecting Software Systems<br\/><br\/>PI: Daniel Menasce<br\/>Co-PIs: Hassan Gomaa, Joao Sousa, Sam Malek<br\/><br\/>This research proposes a framework for Self-Architecting Software Systems (SASSY), a significant paradigm shift in architecting large-scale real-world software systems. Focusing on service-oriented architectures, SASSY includes: 1) Self-architecting: given the service and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, an optimal architecture is automatically generated with the aid of design patterns. The merit of architectural alternatives is evaluated with the aid of multivariate utility functions. 2) Activity-based specification: behavioral requirements are expressed as activity schemas annotated with QoS requirements and domain ontology. 3) Unification of evolution and adaptation: both the evolution of requirements and changes on monitored run-time conditions and QoS trigger the revaluation of architectural alternatives, and, to the extent possible, the automatic reconfiguration of systems. The intellectual merit lies in the development of a novel framework that advances the representation of software architecture and mixed-initiative activities, while integrating optimization theory and analytic models of QoS.

This requires dynamic integration of time-varying measurements of flow, pressure and contaminant concentration with analytical modules including models to simulate the state of the system, statistical methods for adaptive sampling, and optimization methods to search for efficient control strategies. For realistic distribution systems, the analytical modules are highly compute-intensive, requiring multi-level parallel processing via computer clusters. While data often drive the analytical modules, data needs for improving the accuracy and certainty of the solutions generated by these modules dynamically change when a contamination event unfolds. Since such time-sensitive threat events require real-time responses, the computational needs must also be adaptively matched with available resources. Thus, a software system is needed to facilitate this integration via a high-performance computing architecture (e.g., the TeraGrid) such that the measurement system, the analytical modules and the computing resources can mutually adapt and steer each other. The goal of this multi-disciplinary research is to develop a cyberinfrastructure system that will both adapt to and control changing needs in data, models, computer resources and management choices facilitated by a dynamic workflow design. Using virtual simulation and a field study, this cyberinfrastructure will be tested on illustrative scenarios for adaptive management of contamination events in water distribution systems.<br\/><br\/>Urban water distribution systems are vulnerable to accidental and intentional contamination incidents that could result in adverse human health and safety impacts. The pipe network in a typical municipal distribution system includes redundant flow paths to ensure service when parts of the network are unavailable, and is designed with significant storage to deliver water during daily peak demand periods. Thus, a typical network is highly interconnected and experiences significant and frequent fluctuations in flows and transport paths. These design features unintentionally enable contamination at a single point in the system to spread rapidly via different pathways through the network, unbeknown to consumers and operators. When a contamination event is detected via the first line of defense, e.g., data from a water quality surveillance sensor network and reports from consumers, the municipal authorities are faced with several critical questions as the contamination event unfolds: Where is the source of contamination? When and for how long did this contamination occur? Where additional hydraulic or water quality measurements should be taken to pinpoint the source more accurately? What is the current and near future extent of contamination? What response action, such as shutting down portions of the network, implementing hydraulic control strategies, or introducing decontaminants, should be taken to minimize the impact of the contamination event? What would be the impact on consumers by these actions? Real-time answers to such complex questions will present significant computational challenges. This project will address these challenges by developing an adaptive cyberinfrastucture that will enable real-time processing and control through dynamic integration of computational components and real-time sensor data.

Automated testing can significantly help programmers to develop and maintain reliable software. However, test automation is mainly limited to test execution, while test generation remains manual and mostly ad hoc, which not only makes it hard to develop tests initially but also to maintain and reuse tests.<br\/><br\/>To reduce the cost of developing, maintaining, and reusing tests, this project investigates a novel approach to automated testing based on test abstractions. Conceptually, each test abstraction provides a high-level description of a desired test suite: programmers do not need to manually write large suites of individual tests but instead write only test abstractions from which tools automatically generate individual tests. This project investigates five aspects of test abstractions: (1) What languages to use for writing test abstractions? (2) Which tests to generate from test abstractions? (3) How to automatically generate tests from test abstractions? (4) How to determine whether the code under test passed or failed? (5) How to determine which failing tests are caused by the same code error?","title":"CAREER: Systematic Software Testing Using Test Abstractions","awardID":"0746856","effectiveDate":"2008-06-01","expirationDate":"2013-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["518574"],"PO":["564388"]},"136582":{"abstract":"This project expands the capability of man-and-machine design through a creativity enhancing tool which amplifies the human design process by a novel fusion of interactive design with generative coevolution.

A secondary goal is that the products created by students in Game2Learn will be effective in supporting learning in introductory computing courses. The intellectual focus of the project is to develop a Game2Learn course that combines creative processes with learning computing and learn from this course how we might inject creativity into other computing courses. The educational games developed will be evaluated based on: effectiveness for learning, creativity in implementation, creativity afforded to players, and impact on the attitudes of players toward computing. The intellectual merit of this project has two parts: the contributions to computing education through the development of teaching innovations that reward creativity, and the creation of new instructional technologies for computing.

The ITS International Conference is the premier biennial event for promoting promotes rigorous research and development of interactive and adaptive learning environments for learners of all ages; ITS will be the 9th event in the series. The interdisciplinary areas that ITS represents, comprising cognitive science, computer science, and educational technology, are critical research domains that enhance the effectiveness and usability of software learning systems. Active participation of young researchers in this conference is very important, both for the health of the field and for the researchers themselves. The ITS 2008 Young Researcher's Track (YRT) provides a unique opportunity for PhD students partway through their dissertation research to receive valuable feedback and individual mentoring from top researchers in the field. The YRT officially takes place on June 25-27, 2008 during the three days of the conference that follow the pre-conference workshops and tutorials. The program format dedicated to the students will include three 1.5 hour structured poster sessions open to all conference participants. Students will be paired-up with a senior member of the ITS community who serve as a mentor during the conference. The PI holds an active leadership roles within ITS 2008, and personally holds over $1.5 million of NSF grants in the areas of advanced learning technologies and intelligent tutoring systems. <br\/><br\/>Bringing young and creative researchers to ITS 2008 will help advance an important and socially valuable interdisciplinary research field. For many graduate students, the cost of attending the conference exceeds their travel budget. Thus, NSF funding will significantly impact the careers of the next generation of ITS researchers, by enabling a number of them to take part in an important event they would otherwise have to miss; in particular, those who lack funding from other sources (e.g., advisor's grants). The students will have an opportunity to gain wider exposure in the community for their innovative work, and to obtain feedback and guidance from senior members of the research community. Participation will also help foster a sense of community among these young researchers, by allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. The PI and co-PI have indicated that they will act to assure participation by members of traditionally under-represented institutions, and will pay close attention to inclusion of minorities and women.","title":"Support for Young Researchers at the 2008 Intelligent Tutoring Systems Conference","awardID":"0832250","effectiveDate":"2008-06-15","expirationDate":"2009-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["552841"],"PO":["564456"]},"139500":{"abstract":"The internet today provides a wide range of services associated with web sites; examples include getting a stock quote, making an airline reservation, compressing a file or inverting a matrix.

This complexity makes guaranteeing correct operation under all corner cases (logical as well as electrical) an ever more challenging task. This, in turn, translates in to higher and higher practical barriers for microarchitectural innovation for performance optimization as correctness is an overriding consideration. The goal of this CAREER proposal is to explore a new design model called Performance-correctness Explicitly-decoupled Architecture. From ground up, an explicitly-decoupled architecture is designed such that performance optimization circuitry is an independent entity separate from the circuitry guaranteeing functionality and correctness. This explicit separation allows performance optimization to be truly considered in a common-case-only manner, allowing the use of probabilistic techniques considered impractical or even incorrect in a conventional monolithic microarchitecture. This project seeks to develop insights to better understand this design model and develop complexity-effective microarchitectural and software mechanisms for performance optimization.","title":"CAREER: Understanding and Exploring Performance-Correctness Explicitly Decoupled Architecture","awardID":"0747324","effectiveDate":"2008-06-01","expirationDate":"2013-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7941","name":"COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["548271"],"PO":["366560"]},"136586":{"abstract":"This project expands the capability of man-and-machine design through a creativity enhancing tool which amplifies the human design process by a novel fusion of interactive design with generative coevolution.
