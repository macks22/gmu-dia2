{"28082":{"abstract":"Abstract On today's Internet, packets are delivered in a best-effort manner. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is standardizing support for realtime packet delivery on the Internet. The viability of relaxed, as opposed to hard guarantees, realtime services depends fundamentally on the ability of its measurement-based admission control algorithms to determine which connection can be admitted to the network without violating service specifications. Previous research has demonstrated the viability of measurement-based admission control algorithms and relaxed realtime services. However, two important questions remain. First, independent of any specific algorithm, what traffic characteristics can serve as primary indicators to guide the setting of an algorithm's parameters? Second, can global inefficiencies resulting from the local nature of independent admission decisions be minimized? This research proposes to use equivalent token-bucket filter of aggregate traffic to guide the setting of the admission control algorithm's parameters, and to apply a market-based approach to global resource allocation. While there is a sizeable body of literature in the application of market-based control to the allocation of computing resources, no previous work on distributed resource allocation that involves multiple resources and takes into account transaction costs, i.e.~the cost to negotiate and execute a transaction, has been reported.

Not surprisingly, for such problems there are also significant issues in the integration of the software that describes the system being optimized. These difficulties are often intertwined. The research that will be done will look at analytical and algorithmic issues that arise in the solution of such difficult numerical optimization problems. Specifically, the work will evolve along two complementary lines: the further development and analysis of pattern search methods for nonlinear optimization, and the design and analysis of techniques for using approximation models to optimize systems defined by computationally expensive functions. Both these lines of research include a strong effort in software development and experimentation. Practical experience working on numerical optimization problems from science and engineering reveals issues and techniques that are not covered well in the current computer science curriculum and yet would serve students well in any multidisciplinary computational setting. The course development will draw upon existing knowledge and software tools in computer science and computational mathematics to design new courses---practicums, in effect---that will teach students more about how to understand, maintain, enhance, and optimize existing scientific software. The emphasis will be on systematic analysis and testing with an eye toward performance programming. Fundamental to this approach is the belief that students should be taught how to experiment in a systematic, scientific fashion to analyze and reason about extant, complex computer programs.","title":"CAREER: Research in Nonlinear Numerical Optimization and Practicums for Computational Science","awardID":"9734044","effectiveDate":"1998-05-15","expirationDate":"2003-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":["333016"],"PO":["321058"]},"28096":{"abstract":"New digital information resources necessitate the creation of new tools for resource discovery.

In addition, new transceiver architectures are being investigated which will allow multistandard operation which is transparent to the user. Thus, a single personal communication handset could be used anywhere in the world as it automatically adjusts to different local standards and frequencies. Current implementations of portable transceivers typically use a multi-chip, multi-technology approach with a number of precision external filters, resonators, and other components in order to meet the stringent performance requirement of the analog RF interface in such systems. These transitional approaches severely limit the achievable levels of power dissipation and form factor, and are not compatible with low- cost adaptive multistandard operation. This research is exploring new architectures and circuit techniques which will allow utilization of scaled CMOS VLSI technology to integrate the entire transceiver function with only a few external components. The challenge is to find new approaches that overcome the inherent limitations of integrated passive components such as low Q values in integrated inductors, capacitors and varactors, by utilization of the inherently high bandwidth capabilities of scaled integrated MOS transistors. The investigators expect to demonstrate at the end of this research project a single-chip multistandard RF transceiver incorporating synthesizers, transmit path, power amplifier, and receive path as well as providing interface to several different RF standards.

MCA uses randomization to implement random rounding --- which forces roundoff errors to be randomly distributed --- and random unrounding --- which randomly extends the inputs of arithmetic operations to arbitrary precision. MCA has potential theoretical and practical benefits. Random rounding can be used to produce roundoff errors that are truly random and uncorrelated, and that have zero expected bias, thereby avoiding some anomalies of floating-point arithmetic. Random unrounding detects catastrophic cancellation, which is the primary way that significant digits are lost in numerical computation. The primary practical benefit of MCA appears to be that it can give ordinary mortals an intuitive, empirical sense of the accuracy of their computed results. MCA transforms a floating- point computation into a Monte Carlo computation, and roundoff analysis into statistical analysis. By running a program multiple times, one directly measures sensitivity of particular outputs to random perturbations of particular inputs. Generally, it gives a different perspective on the study of error. The project will encompass two tasks: first, development of an MCA environment, a set of tools permitting numerical analysts to run existing programs with MCA instead of standard floating- point, and to analyze the results; second, study of several large- scale applications, numerically interesting models that try to establish, one way or the other, the usefulness of MCA in practice.","title":"Monte Carlo Arithmetic","awardID":"9732309","effectiveDate":"1998-05-15","expirationDate":"1999-10-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":["140393"],"PO":["187585"]},"28153":{"abstract":"The project focuses on several crucial requirements of upcoming information management systems: integrated access to heterogeneous sources, data warehousing, and multimedia data.

The research enhances the state of the art in two areas: the integration of very large numbers of Internet sources and the extraction and querying of semantic information from video data. In the area of data integration, query processing algorithms are developed and integrated into the TSIMMIS mediator system; they use knowledge of data replication to avoid retrieving redundant\/replicated data and enhance the availability and efficiency of the system. A new cost-based optimizer is developed for high performance in browsing of partial results. The optimizer is provided with probabilistic information on source data overlap and develops plans for efficient delivery of partial answers. In the area of video data, the COMIX system is developed. COMIX is customized by users with SQL-like actions and queries that assist COMIX in extracting semantic information orders of magnitude faster than by a brute-force approach. COMIX introduces novel query processing optimizations which exploit the sequentiality, fuzziness and continuity of the video data. In the upcoming era where the Web and the digital TV signal will enter every living room, the proposed version of the TSIMMIS mediator system will allow the user to search the vast volumes of Web data in a manner that exploits redundancy and replication of Web data, rather than being impeded by it (as is currently the case.)

However, the Tsfasman-Vladut-Zink result does not provide an explicit description of the curves. Recently, Garcia and Stichtenoth exhibited two families of curves having an explicit and simple description, that also give rise to codes better than the G-V bound. An explicit description of the AG code is still lacking however, as this requires the determination of a basis for a certain vector space, consisting of functions defined on the curve. This remains an open problem and its solution using the theory of function fields is a principal goal of the research activity under this grant. Recent progress in decoding AG codes has also increased interest in this problem. Also under investigation are a second set of curves arising from the trace function over Galois rings and the intersection of hyperplanes in projective space.

For instance, automatic recognition of natural conversational speech results in incorrect transcription of one- third of the words spoken. Parsing sentences from newspaper articles leads to faulty automatic analysis of half the sentences. The need to make progress in this important area is obvious. The number of available language engineering personnel is small and relatively few universities presently educate students capable of performing the required tasks. The Center for Language and Speech Processing at the Johns Hopkins University is organizing a six week workshop on Language Engineering from July 13 to August 24, 1998, in which teams of professionals and students will work together to advance the state of the art. Three topics will be addressed: (1) Dynamic Segmental Models of Speech Coarticulation; (2) Rapid Speech Recognizer Adaptation to New Speakers; (3) Core Natural Language Processing Technology Applicable to Multiple Languages. University professors, leading industrial and government researchers presently working in widely dispersed locations, graduate students, and six or more undergraduate students selected through a nationwide search will participate in this workshop. Significant technological innovations, training of students, cross-fertilization of ideas from various disciplines, initiation of collaborative research, and creation of valuable training and test corpora are expected to result from this endeavor.","title":"WORKSHOP: Language Engineering Workshop for Students and Professionals Integrating Research and Education (WS98)","awardID":"9732388","effectiveDate":"1998-05-01","expirationDate":"2000-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6845","name":"HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"Y495","name":"DEFENSE-CTR FOR LANGUATE & SPE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"Y537","name":"DARPA-SUMMER SPEECH WORKSHOP"}}],"PIcoPI":["445172"],"PO":["565227"]},"33735":{"abstract":"Networking and Telecommunications Task Force of Educom (NTTF) and FARNET The NSF vBNS program is nearing the end of its 5-year award. As is described in its 1997 midterm review, the vBNS is widely recognized for essential contributions to the development of U.S. capabilities for advanced networking for R&D. In its first three years of service, for example, the vBNS has: - accelerated the planning and implementation of the Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infrastructure, - enabled the interconnection of the Internet2 universities and partners, - served as the core national network for goal 2.1 of the Next Generation Internet project, - supported remote computing and collaborations for significant advances in the sciences and engineering, and - led to the design and improvement of high-performance network technology in the commercial sector. The vBNS expert review concluded with a very strong recommendation that NSF continue its support for advanced networking for research and development after the scheduled conclusion of the present vBNS award. It is now time, therefore, to examine developments in technology and the environment since the vBNS program was designed and to reach sound recommendations on how NSF might best support its goals for the continued development of advanced networking in the coming years. This project intends to organize and oversee a formal process that captures and summarizes the best creative thinking of both experts and generalists in the U.S. community for advanced networking. The result will be a final document and supporting material outlining the major issues and objectives to be addressed by NSF in its follow-on program to the vBNS.","title":"Planning the Next Stage of NSF Advanced Networking Research and Development","awardID":"9812826","effectiveDate":"1998-05-15","expirationDate":"1999-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}}],"PIcoPI":[84879,"43608"],"PO":["121202"]},"32636":{"abstract":"Abstract ANIR-9810082 PI: Delmar Johnson South Dakota State University Brookings, South Dakota This proposal requests funding for the installation of a T1 line and related operating costs to connect the West River Nursing Center (WRNC) to statewide network resources and the Internet.
