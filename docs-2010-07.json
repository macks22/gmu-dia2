{"172282":{"abstract":"The goal of this project is to develop an online-computation-based approach to dynamic decision making in inventory management, focusing on the newsvendor problem. This fundamental problem in operations research is about choosing how many units of a product to order each period when the product has an uncertain demand and becomes obsolete at the end of each period. The existing approaches to the problem attempt to forecast the demand through stochastic models, but are inadequate when the demand is fast-changing or unpredictable, as is often the case with consumer electronics, seasonal products, perishable food, and some vaccines.<br\/><br\/>This project will develop algorithms for the newsvendor problem based on the online computation and online learning approaches, in which the objective is to guarantee the performance of the algorithm in the worst-case, as opposed to the average-case used in stochastic approaches. Several variations of the newsvendor problem will be investigated: when only the number of units sold in any period is known and the true demands are censored, when the pricing strategy has to be chosen as well, and when promotions too have to be planned.<br\/><br\/>The challenge in this project will be to design algorithms that not only guarantee their performance theoretically, but also adapt to rapidly evolving demand patterns observed in the real world. All algorithms developed in this project will be tested on real data from a local supermarket on perishable food products, and compared with the existing stochastic approaches.<br\/><br\/>This interdisciplinary project will apply a traditional computer science approach to a problem in operations research. As the approach is novel in that domain, this exploratory project will lay the groundwork for more comprehensive projects in the future, which could potentially transform the manner in which supply chain planning under extreme uncertainty is conducted. The project will also expand the understanding of online algorithms and their applicability to decision making. It will help evaluate the relative merits, in the real world, of algorithms designed for the worst-case and those designed for the average-case.<br\/><br\/>This project's success will improve supply chain planning, and thereby reduce food wastage, at the local supermarket. It has the potential to benefit supply chain planning at a broader scale, for many products all over the world, saving millions of dollars.","title":"Online Inventory Planning","awardID":"1038020","effectiveDate":"2010-07-01","expirationDate":"2012-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7926","name":"ALGORITHMS"}}],"PIcoPI":[461552],"PO":["565251"]},"164483":{"abstract":"This research seeks to improve collaborative analysis in fields such as criminal justice, intelligence, and epidemiology by developing tools that capture and represent essential elements of analytic conversations.

With Scratch, young people (ages 8 and up) can program their own interactive stories, games, animations, and simulations, then share their creations with others online. Young people around the world have already shared more than 1 million projects on the Scratch community website (http:\/\/scratch.mit.edu). The new generation, called Scratch 2.0, will be fully integrated into the Internet, so that young people can more seamlessly share and collaborate on projects, access online data, and program interactions with social media.<br\/>The research is divided into two strands:<br\/><br\/>-Technological infrastructure for creative collaboration. With Scratch 2.0, people will be able to design and program new types of web-based interactions and services. For example, they will be able to program interactions with social-media websites (such as Facebook), create visualizations with online data, and program their own collaborative applications.<br\/><br\/>-Design experiments for creative collaboration.

Since its public launch in 2007, Scratch has become a vibrant online community, in which young people program and share interactive stories, games, animations, and simulations - and, in the process, learn important computational concepts and strategies for designing, problem solving, and collaborating. Each day, members of the Scratch community upload nearly 1500 new Scratch projects to the website - on average, a new project almost every minute.<br\/><br\/>In developing Scratch 2.0, the team will focus on two questions from the NSF Program Solicitation:<br\/>-Will the research lead to the development of new technologies to support human creativity?<br\/>-Will the research lead to innovative educational approaches in computer science, science, or engineering that reward creativity?<br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit. The intellectual merit of the project is based on its study of how new technologies can foster creativity and collaboration. The investigators will conduct design experiments to examine how new features of Scratch 2.0 engage young people in new forms of creative expression, collaboration, learning, and metadesign. Young people are already interacting with many cloud-based services (such as YouTube and Facebook). But Scratch 2.0 is fundamentally different in that it aims to engage people in programming their own projects and activities in the cloud. With Scratch 2.0, young people won?t just interact with the cloud, they will create in the cloud. The goal is to democratize the development of cloud-based activities, so that everyone can become an active contributor to the cloud, not just a consumer of cloud-based services. This development and study of Scratch 2.0 will lead to new insights into strategies for engaging young people in activities that cultivate collaboration and creativity. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts. The broader impact of the project is based on its ability to broaden participation in programming and computer science. The current version of Scratch has already helped attract a broader diversity of students to computer science compared to other programming platforms. The investigators expect that the collaboration and social-media features of Scratch 2.0 will resonate with the interests of today's youth and further broaden participation. Integration of Scratch into the introductory computer science course at Harvard led to a sharp reduction in the number of students dropping the course, and an increase in the retention of female students. There have been similar results in pre-college courses.

This cooperative viewpoint necessitates revisiting networking research?s foundations, which are being addressed with a two-part strategy:<br\/><br\/>1. Network-centric Cooperative Signal Design: Cooperative signaling injects ?network? into signal design, thereby breaking conventional boundaries. Nodes have to understand how their transmissions will be perceived, decoded, suppressed, cancelled, enhanced or forwarded by other nodes. This fundamental shift in signal design (from conventional point-to-point PHYsical layer) is being addressed by developing capacity bounds, distributed codes and messaging protocols for scalable cooperation. <br\/><br\/>2. Signal-centric Cooperative Network Design: The converse to network-inspired signal design is ?signal-centric? network design. Network resource allocation and control have to be cognizant of signal-level interactions between groups of cooperating nodes,? breaking conventional design boundaries in network protocol design. This foundational change is leading to completely new problem formulations in scheduling, routing and protocol design to harness cooperative signal-scale gains.<br\/><br\/>The project goals are nothing short of rewriting networking fundamentals. By questioning the basic design paradigms, we expect the project will impact research in multiple communities. Our experiment codes and measurements will be open-sourced as community asset.

The project is developing new methods for, and applications of, dimensionality reduction of network graphs. The starting point is recent work by illustrating the power of hyperbolic geometry for the problem. Accordingly, the project has three goals: developing new methods for dimensionality reduction by embedding network graphs in hyperbolic spaces; discovering the applicability of hyperbolic embedding for a wide range of network graphs; and applying hyperbolic embedding to address practical networking questions. Among the problems being investigated is finding new methods for routing that combine the simplicity of greedy routing with the desirable properties of high success rate and efficiency of paths.

The consequences are inefficiency in the form of inflated path lengths, and the use of location-dependent addresses which complicate management, mobility, and multihoming. Routing on location-independent \"flat names\" can solve these problems and is independently useful to support secure, self-certifying identifiers. But no previously proposed protocols exist for scalable, efficient routing directly on flat names. This project is developing distributed compact routing (DCR) protocols which route on flat names while guaranteeing scalability and efficiency for arbitrary networks. Building on recent theoretical advances in the area of compact routing, DCR addresses key challenges including autonomous distributed operation, congestion, and heterogeneity. The project is applying these techniques to Internet routing, mobile ad hoc networks, and content-centric networks. In addition, the project is studying recent systems-oriented proposals to scale Internet routing based on separating the \"core\" of the Internet from the edges, providing firm theoretical footing by determining when they can improve scalability with little loss of network efficiency. The results of this project will significantly improve scalability, mobility, and manageability in the Internet and other networks, bridging a gap between promising theoretical results and emerging practical needs. Results will be disseminated through publications and presentations, a public software release, and graduate and undergraduate courses.","title":"NeTS: Small: Scaling Routing: From Theory to Practice (and Back Again)","awardID":"1017069","effectiveDate":"2010-07-15","expirationDate":"2014-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["508065"],"PO":["564993"]},"165487":{"abstract":"Computer games and other forms of interactive media have many potential benefits -- ranging from the educational to the economic. Games are used to educate in areas such as computer science, health care, and language learning, while game industry revenue is now larger than feature film box office receipts. But many subjects we would wish to teach, and many genres in which we would like to entertain, are fundamentally limited by current authoring approaches: in particular, the amount of character dialogue that must be hand-authored. This project will use what is known about the creative work of human authors together with advanced techniques from the field of \"natural language generation\" to explore a new approach to addressing this problem. In particular, it will integrate a new model of dialogue generation into an advanced tool for interactive story authoring, then evaluate the results when both expert and beginning authors work with the tool, giving us our first understanding of the promise of such techniques for enhancing the creativity of authors.<br\/><br\/>The need for a new approach to dialogue is pressing. For example, the forthcoming commercial game LA Noir has a script of 2,200 pages (roughly equivalent to 12 feature films). Producing this amount of dialogue is simply impossible for educational game producers, and is nearing the limit of what commercial producers can manage, yet games can only continue to grow in sophistication by having more dialogue. This research works toward a solution for this dilemma, opening the door to further educational development and economic growth, by enhancing author creativity through cutting edge computer science. In addition, this project will help develop broader understanding of the field of Creative IT, providing a case study of how the knowledge of creative professionals and scientists can combine to produce social benefits that would be impossible for either working alone.","title":"Pilot: Expressing Dramatic Character in Dialogue: A Toolkit for Creative Exploration of Linguistic Style","awardID":"1002921","effectiveDate":"2010-07-01","expirationDate":"2014-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7788","name":"CreativeIT"}}],"PIcoPI":["542063","536598"],"PO":["565227"]},"168435":{"abstract":"Although theoretical results predict that significant gains can be<br\/>achieved from node cooperation, current wireless systems are exclusively<br\/>built on point-to-point communication, where transmissions are separated<br\/>in time, frequency, or space.

For real-time applications to harness the full potential of multicore chips, the execution time of multicore processors must be predictable, which is particularly crucial for hard real-time and safety-critical systems. Unfortunately, current multicore architectures are designed for maximizing average-case performance, and some architectural features such as shared caches can significantly affect the worst-case performance, making accurate WCET (Worst-Case Execution Time) analysis extremely difficult, if not impossible.

In addition to systematic analysis of existing multicore architectural features that can severely affect time predictability of computing, this project will develop a variety of time-predictable cache and memory architectures to ensure time predictability. This project will also implement TMulticore on a FPGA to develop deep understanding of real design constraints for time-predictable multicore\/manycore chips.<br\/><br\/>The success of this project is expected to enable the safe and reliable use of multicore\/manycore processors for a wide variety of real-time applications to enhance their performance and energy efficiency with deterministic computation time.

The project perspective is that computational thinking can be usefully thought of as a specialized form of mathematical modeling. The product of computational thinking in a particular domain is a model of a situation, a structuring and representation of the situation, that enables computations to be performed to answer questions, solve problems, control processes, predict consequences, or enhance understanding. <br\/><br\/>Since computational thinking is a relatively new construct in STEM and STEM education, there are few available curriculum materials to support instruction intended to develop the understanding, habits of mind, and specific techniques that are involved. The fundamental goal of the VCT project is to answer an engineering research question: \"What kinds of instructional materials and learning experiences will develop effective computational thinking skills and attitudes?\" The VCT project is applying a design research process involving iterative phases of development, pilot testing, and revision to produce prototype instructional materials that will be useful as stand-alone curriculum modules or when collected into different packages to support full high school courses. Project field test evaluation will provide preliminary evidence about the efficacy of the materials in developing desired student learning.<br\/><br\/>Proponents of computational thinking in STEM and STEM education have argued that it offers a powerful general approach to problem solving in discipline-specific and inter-disciplinary settings. They also argue that, when properly taught, it can provide an effective introduction and attraction to careers in computer science and other computing-intensive fields. Thus the VCT project has a long-term goal of broadening participation in computer science and related technology fields.

However, this design principle is largely an artifact of design simplification. In contrast, if neighboring nodes pool their resources, and cooperate in their signal transmissions, the network could turn interference to its advantage for potentially many-fold increase in network capacity. This cooperative viewpoint necessitates revisiting networking research?s foundations, which are being addressed with a two-part strategy:<br\/><br\/>1. Network-centric Cooperative Signal Design: Cooperative signaling injects \"network\" into signal design, thereby breaking conventional boundaries. Nodes have to understand how their transmissions will be perceived, decoded, suppressed, cancelled, enhanced or forwarded by other nodes. This fundamental shift in signal design (from conventional point-to-point PHYsical layer) is being addressed by developing capacity bounds, distributed codes and messaging protocols for scalable cooperation. <br\/><br\/>2. Signal-centric Cooperative Network Design: The converse to network-inspired signal design is ?signal-centric? network design. Network resource allocation and control have to be cognizant of signal-level interactions between groups of cooperating nodes,? breaking conventional design boundaries in network protocol design. This foundational change is leading to completely new problem formulations in scheduling, routing and protocol design to harness cooperative signal-scale gains.<br\/><br\/>The project goals are nothing short of rewriting networking fundamentals. By questioning the basic design paradigms, we expect the project will impact research in multiple communities. Our experiment codes and measurements will be open-sourced as community asset.

To maximize overall human effectiveness, user interfaces intended for life-critical and time-critical complex multitasking need to be designed to account for a person?s ability to monitor and respond to multiple information sources in parallel. And yet, there is little or no practical scientific theory to explain the human abilities, limitations, and strategies for multimodal (auditory and visual) multitasking.<br\/><br\/>This project develops the science base needed for predictive modeling of human abilities to integrate across multiple modalities to accomplish multiple tasks in parallel.

HUBO will be the first homogeneous, full-sized humanoid to be used as a common research and education platform. Eight universities (Drexel, CMU, MIT, Ohio State, Penn, Purdue, Southern California, and VaTech), representing a critical mass of humanoids research within US, participate in this development of the world's first homogeneous full-sized humanoid team. Building upon unique expertise, the work extends current capabilities, resulting in six identical units, facilitating the following potentially transformative advances in robotics:<br\/>- A state-of-the-art, standardized humanoid platform instrument with embedded capabilities for sensing, manipulation, and rapid locomotion, ideal for a broad range of future humanoids research<br\/>- The ability, for the first time, to directly compare and across validate algorithms and methodologies and consistently benchmark results across research teams<br\/>- Novel energy storage technology for mobile robotics incorporating supercapacitors for operations requiring high power density, far exceeding the capabilities of traditional battery-only power sources<br\/>- A widely distributed platform that motivates, recruits, and trains a broad range of students spanning multiple disciplines, including artificial intelligence, digital, signal processing, mechanics, and control<br\/>Humanoids, robots engineered to mimic human form and motion, open broad avenues of cross disciplinary research spanning multiple fields, such as mechanical control, artificial intelligence, and power systems. Common humanoids are rarely autonomous and are not-ready for unconstrained interaction with humans. The most compelling demonstrations are meticulously pre-programmed and painstakingly choreographed. A few common platforms have already advanced some research. Hence, having a consistent platform should facilitate rapid progress in areas needed for autonomy and natural interaction, including mobility, manipulation, robot vision, speech communication, and cognition and learning. However, although currently Japan and Korea are considered world leaders in design and construction of humanoids, best practices have not been developed for constructing multiple, identical humanoids. These conditions call for the making of an urgently needed benchmark providing evaluations and cross-validation of results. With this development and the servicing of 6 humanoids, this project aims to create knowledge and best practices contributing to robotics research, possibly leading to the standardization needed for ubiquity.<br\/>Broader Impacts: <br\/>The instrument enables US researchers to develop expertise in the design and construction of humanoids, while the distribution of the work activities ensures the broad dissemination of the knowledge. Humanoids research, inherently interdisciplinary and integrative, inspires young students. The graduate and undergraduates students participating are likely to receive a world-class training in robotics. Outreach partners, including several high-profile museums will introduce people of all ages to the exciting technologies of robotics, particularly useful in recruiting K-12 students into science, engineering, mathematics, etc. A partnership with the Science Leadership Academy (SLA), a magnet school with more than 63% underrepresented students, assures their involvement. With SLA, the project initiates an annual program modeled on a NASA-style experiment design competition, in which students use simulation tools to propose humanoids projects and activities.

This trade-off proved highly successful for applications such as web crawling, search, and content distribution.

Recognizing that large-scale, complex systems are typically built-up from smaller groups---which either provide different functionality or partition some larger state-space into smaller, more manageable parts---it leverages a group compositional approach to tackle the problem. First, the research develops novel protocols for smaller groups of nodes that offer strong properties at minimal overhead. Second, it proposes a coordination service and a suite of management algorithms that adaptively organizes these groups and composes them together.

Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art in end-to-end transport protocols scales to at most a few gigabit-per-seconds of single-stream steady-state throughput. This project considers the novel paradigm of \"packet-scale congestion-control\", which can potentially improve scalability by several orders of magnitude. The paradigm, however, faces three fundamental issues that seriously challenge its promise to deliver in practice. This project addresses these risks by: (i) Developing formal queuing-theoretic models for the packet-scale paradigm and studying and addressing the impact of \"noise\" in end-to-end feedback. (ii) Conducting closed-loop analysis of interaction of the paradigm with network elements to study stability, fairness and burstiness in aggregated settings. (iii) Designing OS mechanisms that can ensure accurate inter-packet spacings and robustly deal with inaccuracies. This project is expected to lead to transformative innovation in both formal methods as well as end-host implementations that are likely to be key ingredients for future ultra-high-speed transport protocols. Such protocols will be significant enablers for distributed scientific computation by the High Energy Physics, Bio-informatics, and Radio-astronomy communities. Second, ultra-high speed protocols that can run without adverse effects on the shared public Internet will result in enormous infrastructural cost-savings. Third, the project will be an excellent source of undergraduate and graduate students trained in experimentation, measurements, and scientific analysis---skills that are invaluable for many federal, commercial and academic institutions.

Touch is at once an elegant and maddening interface modality. It is elegant in its simplicity: one can make a selection or tap a button or key with no intervening mouse or joystick. Moreover, touch (especially multi?]finger touch) supports gestures, such as swiping and expanding, which are satisfyingly natural. It is maddening, however, due to the lack of tactile and kinesthetic feedback that are so critical to natural touch. Typing on a virtual keyboard, for instance, is typically an experience of visually guided hunt?]and?]peck with liberal use of the back?]space key.<br\/><br\/>In this research the PIs will further develop a new class of surface haptic devices, called xPaDs, that promise to enrich the use of touch screen and touchpad interfaces for sighted as well as blind users. xPaDs are notable because they provide controllable shear forces between the fingertips and an ordinary sheet of glass. By controlling shear force in response to a measure of fingertip position (which may be obtained using a variety of existing technologies), it is possible to simulate a huge array of virtual effects; examples include toggle switches that flip from one state to another (each state is a \"potential well\" on the glass surface that pulls the finger to a given location), and contours that can be easily traced.<br\/><br\/>The heart of the current project lies in the systems engineering that will lead to practical and effective devices capable of controlling a force at one or more fingertips, and in the psychophysical and application?]based studies that will teach us how these capabilities may best be used. xPaDs are sophisticated dynamic systems that employ ultrasonic vibrations to modulate friction synchronized with in?]plane vibrations to produce controllable force vectors. The PIs will address the challenges of controlling force individually at each fingertip, of producing xPaDs with large surface area, and of minimizing energy consumption and audible noise generation. They will use the idea and methodology of \"pop?]out\" experiments to find haptic primitives, that is to say features the human perceptual system can extract with minimal or no perceptual load. The PIs will measure the information transmission capacity of surface haptic devices treated as symbolic channels. And they will explore the ability of the perceptual system to \"bind\" surface haptic features presented to different fingertips into a meaningful, coherent whole. These studies will position the PIs for investigating a set of applications for the blind.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Computer interfaces for the blind often rely heavily on speech, which necessarily presents information serially. The PIs argue that a haptic surface can augment a speech?]based interface with critical spatial information. They will study the editing and reading of mathematical expressions, of locating key content on a web page, of navigating intersections, and of planning routes with tools such as Google Maps. In addition, the PIs will develop a low?]cost xPaD development kit, make the plans and code available on the Internet, and develop a high school enrichment unit based upon these materials.","title":"HCC: Medium: Collaborative Research: Surface Haptics via Tractive Forces","awardID":"0964100","effectiveDate":"2010-07-01","expirationDate":"2014-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[438447],"PO":["565227"]},"172266":{"abstract":"The recent decade has witnessed rapid advances in computer vision research, not only in its fundamental studies but also its emerging applications.

Early attempts at computer-aided sketching overlay a sketching interface on a CAD approach for 3D modeling. This approach has been successful in quickly communicating designs that have already been fully envisioned, but is problematic in early conceptual design. Fundamental in CAD is the requirement that there is always an underlying consistent 3D solid representation. Requiring a consistent 3D model is an impediment to early conceptual design. Geometric forms must be either constrained or generated automatically without the designer's input. In the early conceptual phase the designer needs the freedom to experiment with incomplete and possibly inconsistent views and details. Early work has shown that 3D design and analysis can be performed using only strokes attached to 2D planes placed in 3D space. This research extends the free-form paradigm by experimenting with additional sketch primitives and interactions. The base 3D stroke system will be used as a starting point. Techniques for selecting and displaying additional elements, such as images, 3D fragments and 2.5D surface representations will be added. The intellectual merit of the project is the change in the nature of CAD systems that better support conceptual design by incorporating sketches and concepts that can be placed on a 3D model without requiring that the model be made consistent, until the designer is ready to enforce consistency. The broader impact of the project is the development of sketching and CAD tools that are relevant to early concept and creative designers.","title":"EAGER: Exploratory Research in Creative Sketching for 3D Design","awardID":"1044030","effectiveDate":"2010-07-15","expirationDate":"2011-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["548698"],"PO":["565227"]},"167602":{"abstract":"Current wireless network architectures are based on interference avoidance, which advocates eliminating simultaneous transmissions to avoid collisions at the receivers. However, this design principle is largely an artifact of design simplification.

This cooperative viewpoint necessitates revisiting networking research?s foundations, which are being addressed with a two-part strategy:<br\/><br\/>1. Network-centric Cooperative Signal Design: Cooperative signaling injects ?network? into signal design, thereby breaking conventional boundaries. Nodes have to understand how their transmissions will be perceived, decoded, suppressed, cancelled, enhanced or forwarded by other nodes. This fundamental shift in signal design (from conventional point-to-point PHYsical layer) is being addressed by developing capacity bounds, distributed codes and messaging protocols for scalable cooperation. <br\/><br\/>2. Signal-centric Cooperative Network Design: The converse to network-inspired signal design is ?signal-centric? network design. Network resource allocation and control have to be cognizant of signal-level interactions between groups of cooperating nodes,? breaking conventional design boundaries in network protocol design. This foundational change is leading to completely new problem formulations in scheduling, routing and protocol design to harness cooperative signal-scale gains.<br\/><br\/>The project goals are nothing short of rewriting networking fundamentals.

Research outcomes will include: Discovery of design requirements for technologies to support the health of young children, especially for families from diverse and underserved populations; A suite of three new technologies based on the design requirements that leverage mobile and social computing technologies for assisting parents of young children with tracking their child's health information and learning about children's health; Validation of computing technology as a viable means of supporting parent record-keeping, of increasing parent knowledge and confidence in their child's developmental progress, and improving parent-pediatrician communication. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This research involves conducting formative studies that further our knowledge of how health technology can be designed for underserved populations so as to minimize anxiety and support the doctor-patient relationship. Thus, the project will address a major public health goal of more closely tracking the health and development of young children, especially those from lower income backgrounds and those with developmental delay. The findings will have implications for domains beyond early childhood development. Project outcomes will expand our knowledge about how mobile and social computing applications can be developed and adapted based on the financial and time constraints of the users. Finally, this work will help refine techniques for evaluating technology applications designed for behavior change and long term outcomes, which in turn will advance the field of Human-Computer Interaction in general.","title":"CAREER: Healthy Families: Technology to Support the Health and Wellness of Young Children","awardID":"0952623","effectiveDate":"2010-07-01","expirationDate":"2015-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["560939"],"PO":["565227"]},"172002":{"abstract":"This award supports a Doctoral Research Workshop at the 2010 ACM International Conference on Intercultural Collaboration (ICIC 2010), August 18-20, 2010, in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Two key mechanisms are developed to estimate the delay from a router to a destination and service a packet based on its upstream earliness and downstream laxness for more efficient resource sharing among partially-overlapping flows.<br\/>The results from this project will provide a viable practical solution to support large-scale distribution control systems and enable more powerful applications in power control, traffic monitoring, and energy management.

Five years ago, Internet traffic was mainly controlled by the standard TCP AIMD algorithm, whereas Internet traffic is now controlled by many different congestion control algorithms. However, there is very little work on the performance and stability study of the Internet with heterogeneous congestion control. One fundamental reason is the lack of the deployment information of different congestion control algorithms. Motivated by the increasing number of public, private, and proprietary congestion control algorithms deployed in the Internet and the lack of the information about the heterogeneous Internet, the goals of this project are to 1) design methodologies and tools for identifying the congestion control algorithms and related parameters of Internet nodes and flows, and 2) conduct large scale comprehensive measurements for identifying and evaluating the congestion control algorithms in the heterogeneous Internet. As an analogy, if we consider the Internet as a country, an Internet node as a house and a congestion control algorithm running at a node as a person living at a house, this project is to conduct a population census in the country of the Internet.

The instrument is expected to catalyze new approaches for conducting research via synergistic amalgamation of heterogeneous supercomputing and cyber-enabled tools that enhance ease of use. In particular, it should allow end users to:<br\/>- Make commonplace the ability to perform in-situ visualization for rapid visual information synthesis and analysis, and<br\/>- Control their level of immersion in the discovery process from being immersed (a la 'human in the loop' intuitively making real-time decisions via a large-scale gigapixel display), to observing the instrument automatically collect, organize, and analyze data of visual analytics.<br\/>Recent trends have exposed the CPU as a 'jack of all computing trades, master of none,' thus giving rise to heterogeneous computing instruments with multiple types of brains (e.g., CPUs and GPUs). Though conventional wisdom believed in 2007 that missing genes in 699 microbial genomes was computationally infeasible, the PI led a team of more than twenty interdisciplinary researchers from eight institutions around the world and developed software cybertool instruments to integrate a set of distributed supercomputing with more that twelve thousand CPUs to complete the task in ten weeks. Coupled with the existing cybertools and those available from NVIDIA the instrument should enable completion of the task in a day with only two researchers. HokieSpeed will have 8,192 CPU cores and at least 61,440 GPU cores in 40 square feet and deliver 35 times better peak performance, 70 times better power efficiency, and 14 times better space efficiency than the current system at the institution (circa 2003) while offering versatility by enabling discovery through a large-scale gigapixel display and appropriately varying degrees of interaction between human and machine. Creating new forms of social research, and 'what if' scenarios for evaluation and promising to deliver research advances across multiple disciplines, the results will be generated often in real time allowing immediate in-situ visualization on a gigapixel display.<br\/>Broader Impacts: <br\/>Reaching a broad community, the instrument is expected to herald a new age in multi-purpose and interdisciplinary computing instrumentation creating a computational ecosystem that simplifies access and use of the instrument to the masses. Students, including females and underrepresented minorities, will learn about energy-efficient computing, and visualization and interaction at large scale. Among others, the project will also utilize programs that specifically service broader impacts: MAOP (Multicultural\/Minority Academic Opportunities Program), CTech2 (Computers and Technology at VaTech), and CRA-W's CREU (Collaborative Research Experience for Undergraduates). Additionally, it will extend an experimental GPU course and offer a workshop version for on-line instruction. Other activities include K-12 outreach, and delivery by CREU of information technology (IT) to rural and economically disadvantaged areas via virtual computing and the VaTech-STEM K-12 Outreach Initiative.","title":"MRI-R2: Acquisition of a Heterogeneous Supercomputing Instrument for Transformative Interdisciplinary Research","awardID":"0960081","effectiveDate":"2010-07-01","expirationDate":"2013-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1189","name":"MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["533297","563449",435899],"PO":["557609"]},"163875":{"abstract":"We live in a world made of diverse materials whose variations in appearance enrich our visual experience. It is also this variability of materials that adds daunting complexity to image understanding. This research program aims to establish the theoretical and computational foundation for automatic visual understanding and recognition of real-world materials. The program tackles this challenging problem from three key aspects, namely, deriving 1) novel hybrid physically-based and data-driven representations of the spatial, angular, spectral, temporal, and scale variations of material appearance, 2) active and passive methods for estimating the values of physically-based parameters that govern material appearance, and 3) single-image material recognition methods that leverage physically-based optical parameters as priors or invariants to guide machine learning techniques. These research thrusts lead to a comprehensive set of computational tools to recognize materials in real-world images despite their complex appearance variations, such as recognizing rusted metals, discerning soft cloth from hard concrete, identifying different fat content of milks, and labeling image regions with material traits like soft, hard, rough, and heavy.<br\/><br\/>The capabilities resulting from this program are crucial to a broad range of scenarios, for instance, to enable humanoid robots to understand that it should not squeeze the soft hands of a child, autonomous vehicles to understand what regions to avoid in a rugged terrain, visual analyses of tissues to help medical diagnosis, and automated inspection systems to reliably discover sub-standard quality food to prevent ill-health.

Such data acquisition and real-time signal processing are used in a wide range of applications, such as environmental sensor networks (powered by solar cells or by energy harvesting using vibrational energy), and implantable or ingestible biomedical devices for prosthetics or for continuous diagnostics and monitoring. In these applications, new information is often generated infrequently, at irregular and unpredictable intervals. This event-based nature calls for a drastic re-thinking of how these signals are monitored and processed. Conventional synchronous (i.e. clocked) digital techniques, which use fixed-rate operation to evaluate data whether or not it has changed, are a poor match, often leading to high power consumption. This research aims instead to provide viable \"event-based\" systems: controlled not by a clock but rather by the arrival of each event. Such continuous-time data acquisition promises significant power and energy reduction, flexible support for a variety of signal processing protocols and encodings, high-quality output signals, and graceful scalability to future microelectronic technologies. Asynchronous (i.e. clockless) digital logic techniques, which are ideally suited for this work, are combined with continuous-time digital signal processing, to make this task possible; both of these areas have been researched by the principal investigators under prior NSF support. A series of silicon chips will be designed and fully evaluated, culminating in a fully programmable, event-driven data acquisition and signal processing system, which can be used as a testbed for a wide variety of real-world applications.<br\/><br\/>This work is expected to have broad impact. The resulting chips and methodology will provide significant practical benefits in widely-used applications where energy resources are scarce, such as in biomedical electronics, sensor networks and portable communications devices, which must operate on a small battery for a long lifetime. The chip development will be directed towards these applications through close consultation with expert colleagues in biomedical engineering, and through the investigators? existing close ties with US microelectronics companies. In addition, the research is expected to provide fundamental new advances in ultra-low-power microelectronics systems, which can have an impact on such diverse areas as power electronics and new types of control systems for mechanical vibration control. Finally, the results of this work will be extensively disseminated to the research community, to promote and advance the practical use of these techniques, as well as to promote further research and education in this area, including through its incorporation into curricula at Columbia University and other leading universities.","title":"SHF: Medium: Power-Adaptive, Event-Driven Data Conversion and Signal Processing Using Asynchronous Digital Techniques","awardID":"0964606","effectiveDate":"2010-07-01","expirationDate":"2014-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7936","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7941","name":"COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7945","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYST"}}],"PIcoPI":["526881","518562"],"PO":["366560"]},"163776":{"abstract":"Surface Haptics, or the creation of virtual haptic effects on physical surfaces, is a topic of rapidly growing importance in human?]computer interaction because of the increasingly widespread use of touch screens. Touch is at once an elegant and maddening interface modality. It is elegant in its simplicity: one can make a selection or tap a button or key with no intervening mouse or joystick. Moreover, touch (especially multi?]finger touch) supports gestures, such as swiping and expanding, which are satisfyingly natural. It is maddening, however, due to the lack of tactile and kinesthetic feedback that are so critical to natural touch. Typing on a virtual keyboard, for instance, is typically an experience of visually guided hunt?]and?]peck with liberal use of the back?]space key.<br\/><br\/>In this research the PIs will further develop a new class of surface haptic devices, called xPaDs, that promise to enrich the use of touch screen and touchpad interfaces for sighted as well as blind users. xPaDs are notable because they provide controllable shear forces between the fingertips and an ordinary sheet of glass. By controlling shear force in response to a measure of fingertip position (which may be obtained using a variety of existing technologies), it is possible to simulate a huge array of virtual effects; examples include toggle switches that flip from one state to another (each state is a \"potential well\" on the glass surface that pulls the finger to a given location), and contours that can be easily traced.<br\/><br\/>The heart of the current project lies in the systems engineering that will lead to practical and effective devices capable of controlling a force at one or more fingertips, and in the psychophysical and application?]based studies that will teach us how these capabilities may best be used. xPaDs are sophisticated dynamic systems that employ ultrasonic vibrations to modulate friction synchronized with in?]plane vibrations to produce controllable force vectors. The PIs will address the challenges of controlling force individually at each fingertip, of producing xPaDs with large surface area, and of minimizing energy consumption and audible noise generation. They will use the idea and methodology of \"pop?]out\" experiments to find haptic primitives, that is to say features the human perceptual system can extract with minimal or no perceptual load. The PIs will measure the information transmission capacity of surface haptic devices treated as symbolic channels. And they will explore the ability of the perceptual system to \"bind\" surface haptic features presented to different fingertips into a meaningful, coherent whole. These studies will position the PIs for investigating a set of applications for the blind.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Computer interfaces for the blind often rely heavily on speech, which necessarily presents information serially.

While dictionaries have been developed from mathematical principles, a recent discovery is that their efficiency can be greatly enhanced, if the dictionary itself is learned from examples of the data. Because compressive sensing depends critically on the interaction of the dictionary with the sensing mechanism, joint learning of the two from the data itself is expected to provide the greatest benefits. However, to date there have been only a handful of heuristic attempts in this direction. The investigator is developing the first <br\/>systematic theory for dictionary learning, and for joint learning of dictionaries and sensing mechanism. He will demonstrate the theory and algorithms on real sensing applications, and in particular on challenging medical diagnostic applications.<br\/><br\/>The specific goals of this project are to develop theory and algorithms with performance guarantees for (i) learning dictionaries for sparse signal representation for compressive sensing; (ii) joint learning of dictionary and the sensing operators optimum for compressive sensing; and to demonstrate the theory and algorithms on challenging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) applications. Ultimately, this research may lead to MRI and CT techniques for improved imaging of the beating heart or brain function from less data in less time, improving health care and reducing its cost.","title":"CIF: Small: Dictionary Learning for Compressed Sensing","awardID":"1018660","effectiveDate":"2010-07-01","expirationDate":"2014-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7936","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING"}}],"PIcoPI":["551068"],"PO":["564898"]},"170982":{"abstract":"The PI's team is working on a website for family reunification for the Haiti earthquake.

This project focuses on intermediate data that is generated during the execution of parallelized dataflow programs in clouds. Such cloud intermediate data brings forth several unique characteristics: they are massive-scale, distributed, subjected to computational barriers, and prolong job run-times when subjected to server failures. Further, the size of intermediate data in a cloud application is often comparable to or larger than input or output data size, and it can thus range in terabytes. Thus, in spite of extensive existing work on traditional storage problems, there is a critical need for new algorithms and systems that target cloud intermediate data.<br\/> This project is the first to treat cloud intermediate data as a first-class citizen. The project will involve new algorithm design and analysis, original systems building and implementation, deployment in real world testbeds, and performance of measurement studies. Concretely, this project will build a new system that explicitly manages intermediate data in cloud dataflow programs in order to improve their fault-tolerance, and design and realize barrier relaxation strategies to improve performance of cloud programs. We will implement using open software, deploy, and experimentally evaluate our systems atop the NSF infrastructure called the Cloud Computing Testbed (CCT) that is hosted at the University of Illinois. Finally, we will perform measurement studies of workload characteristics of cloud intermediate data. <br\/> A fuller understanding of intermediate data in clouds can spawn research in managing cloud infrastructures, improve run-time performance of cloud applications, and lead to new cloud programming paradigms. Our contributions will directly improve the performance and fault-tolerance of applications that are run on the community infrastructure CCT, and positively impact design and deployment of existing and emerging industry clouds.

Each bit of this vector represents a high-level scene attribute with widely varying degrees of specificity and resolution ? some are very coarse (general hypotheses) and some are very fine (specific hypotheses). The other component is a simple conditional data model for a corresponding family of learned binary classifiers, one per bit. The scene interpretation is then computed by assessing hypotheses in a highly coarse-to-fine manner, using an image parsing algorithm called ?entropy pursuit? based on stepwise uncertainty reduction, and classifiers for detecting events in spatiotemporal volumes which leverage on recent advances at the intersection of machine learning and dynamical systems. The computational models and scene parsing algorithms developed in this project are broadly applicable to scene interpretation problems arising in many areas of science and engineering.

This research program aims to establish the theoretical and computational foundation for automatic visual understanding and recognition of real-world materials. The program tackles this challenging problem from three key aspects, namely, deriving 1) novel hybrid physically-based and data-driven representations of the spatial, angular, spectral, temporal, and scale variations of material appearance, 2) active and passive methods for estimating the values of physically-based parameters that govern material appearance, and 3) single-image material recognition methods that leverage physically-based optical parameters as priors or invariants to guide machine learning techniques.

By using more, slower, computers in tandem, the architecture runs more energy efficiently. However, doing so in a practical manner requires overcoming many significant challenges: The individual nodes have much less memory than programmers are used to; the computational task must be split across a much larger number of nodes, and the load must be balanced between them so that no single slow computer will cause the overall operation to be delayed too long. Modern datacenter environments further operate under very strict requirements for processing delay in order to ensure user satisfaction; these requirements may be harder to meet when running on the FAWN architecture.<br\/><br\/>The project is tackling these challenges by developing new techniques for storing and managing large volumes of data on fast solid-state<br\/>(Flash) memory. Through collaboration with experts in CS theory, the project is developing new algorithms for memory-efficient, highly parallel data analysis and data-mining, and implementing and evaluating them in a demanding, high-performance environment.

Organic semiconductors are being considered as alternative materials to conventional silicon-based electronics, possibly enabling a new generation of low-cost, mechanically flexible, easily manufactured electronic devices. Asynchronous logic, which does not rely on timing assumption, may be the best design method for such technologies where the parameters are not well controlled and the implementation of a global clock-network is very difficult. The argument is that, since all parameter variations affect the timing, a logic that is independent of the timing and that does not use a clock, will tolerate extreme parameter variations. The main goal of this research is to apply asynchronous logic to the design of digital systems in printed electronics. The hope is that, by relaxing the requirements on the physical parameters imposed by timing constraints, the currrent state of the technology may become ``good enough'' for implementing digital circuits without further improvement. A concrete target is to design and fabricate the very first microcontroller in printed electronics, more specifically with inkjet printer technology.<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>Organic semiconductors will not replace current silicon-based technology as the performance characteristics are very different.

But probably the most interesting ones are still to be discovered. The idea of being able to print circuits on an inkjet printer with one single type of polymer and in ambient conditions is very appealing because of the potential simplicity and availability of the technique. Comparing the price of a current IC fabrication facility (billions of dollars) to the price of an inkjet printer (thousands of dollars) is enough to appreciate the huge potentials of the technology. An added advantage in an academic environment is that the idea of printing their own circuits would be very exciting to students...","title":"SHF: EAGER: Asynchronous Logic for Printed Electronics (ALPE)","awardID":"1035609","effectiveDate":"2010-07-01","expirationDate":"2013-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7945","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYST"}}],"PIcoPI":[460489],"PO":["562984"]},"161866":{"abstract":"Each human fingertip has approximately 2000 tactile sensors. Stimulation of these sensors triggers reactive grip responses that are mediated by the spine. In comparison to the dexterous capabilities of the human hand, robotic manipulation capabilities in unstructured environments are crude. When controlled by a human operator, robotic manipulators are further limited by restricted information flow (command and sensing) at the human-machine interface. All human-machine systems, from telesurgery robots to neuroprostheses, must address the critical issue of communication delays which can range, depending upon the distance between the human and the machine, from less than a second to hours. For artificial manipulation, even delays of one second can result in adverse events such as increased bleeding from an open incision or increased frustration and eventual disuse of an advanced prosthesis. Taking a cue from biology, autonomous low-level reflexes that detect stimuli and implement a corrective response in robotic hands without a human in the loop could buy time for communication, information processing, and decision-making in human-machine systems. A long-term research objective of the PI is to advance robotic manipulation with grip reflex algorithm primitives, artificial tactile sensors, and generalizable grasp policy algorithms inspired by the human hand. In this project, she will focus on understanding what drives low-level reactive grip responses, how human-machine performance can benefit from the implementation of similar autonomous primitives, and what grasp policies can be learned by a robotic hand. Contributions of this work will include characterization of the reactive grip responses in human hands, development of human-inspired grip reflex algorithm primitives and tactile sensors for robotic hands, and development of learning algorithms that autonomously extract general grasp policies for robotic hands. Research outcomes will enhance our fundamental understanding of grasp primitives in human hands that provide a foundation for dexterous manipulation, and improve the functionality of robotic hands through grip reflex algorithm primitives and learning algorithms that extract grasp policies.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This research will transform artificial manipulation by enabling robotic grasp with dynamic control of adduction\/abduction degrees-of-freedom and use of biomimetic tactile sensors, thereby revolutionizing robotic manipulators intended for unstructured, access-limited, or unsafe environments (including space, underwater, military, rescue, surgery, assistive, rehabilitative, and prosthetic) that require robustness in the face of uncertainty, control delays, or limited information flow at the human-machine interface. In conjunction with her research the PI will work to engage students at an early age in the exploration of the rich field of robotics. To that end, she will develop hands-on instructional modules for teaching elementary and middle school students about robotics using low-cost materials and deploy them locally for the benefit of students under-represented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. She will also develop an interactive exhibit for a science museum on robotic hands deploy it locally for the benefit of school-aged children and the general public in the metropolitan Phoenix area.","title":"CAREER: Primitives and Policies for Complex Behavior in Human and Robotic Hands","awardID":"0954254","effectiveDate":"2010-07-15","expirationDate":"2015-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["539697"],"PO":["565227"]},"163736":{"abstract":"There has been an enormous amount of work in recent years directed<br\/>toward understanding the structural and dynamical properties of<br\/>\"informatics graphs\" or \"complex networks.\" Most of this work has been<br\/>on small to medium-sized networks, and it has led to an improved<br\/>understanding of the properties of networks arising in many graph<br\/>mining applications.

Equilibrium specifies conditions under which the strategic choices of agents are in some sense stable.

The advanced functionalities (such as stability control and collision avoidance) in modern vehicles impose high computational demand on their electronic control systems, which can be powered by multicore processors to mitigate their increasing complexity. However, the existing scheduling theory and techniques have fallen short of supporting such networked multicore-based control systems, especially considering the human-related factors and dynamic environments of smart vehicles.<br\/><br\/>This project undertakes a comprehensive study of resource management techniques and scheduling algorithms to efficiently schedule various real-time applications and effectively utilize the computation power in networked multicore-based smart vehicle control systems. First, a hierarchical control architecture with a simplified high-level master controller is being investigated to achieve accurate situational awareness and ensure prompt response. Second, to address the uncertainty in dynamic environment, distributed and multicore-aware elastic real-time scheduling algorithms are being developed that can adaptively adjust the invocation interval of various control tasks for schedulability and stability. Moreover, criticality-aware scheduling algorithms are being developed that consider the variable importance of control tasks under different situations. Finally, energy-efficient multicore scheduling algorithms and battery management schemes for hybrid\/electric smart vehicles are being investigated.<br\/><br\/>The design and development of the proposed scheduling framework has a direct economic and societal impact, which can reduce car accidents and thus save lives.

The cost of obtaining an individual's genome via sequencing has dropped several orders of magnitude during the past decade, and may reach the so-called $1,000 genome target within the next few years. Now much attention has shifted to sequencing on a population scale. Large amount of population sequencing data has already been generated. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of new computational methods that work with noisy, high-throughput sequencing data to provide efficient and accurate analysis for important population genomics problems.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual merits of the work include the development of accurate computational methods that are capable of analyzing large-scale high-throughput sequencing data for several population genomics problems. Problems of interest include inferring genotypes, correcting sequencing errors and detecting meiotic recombination, as well as searching for disease-causing rare gene variants and other emerging applications of high-throughput sequencing. A key difference between the proposed research and many existing methods is that the proposed approaches are explicitly designed for processing large amount of high-throughput sequencing data. One particular focus is on applying combinatorial optimization techniques such as integer linear programming, which is not well-known to biologists. Probabilistic models will also be used and integrated with optimization approaches to provide efficient and accurate solutions. The expected project outcome includes efficient algorithms for the above population genomics problems, related open-source software tools, and rigorous methodologies for both theoretical and empirical evaluation of the algorithms.<br\/><br\/>Part of the contribution of this work to computer science is that the study of algorithms for handling short sequencing reads may contribute to the research of string matching algorithms, a problem of general interests in computer science. Noisy sequencing data motivates naturally approximate string matching and may lead to new string-based problem formulations. Due to the need of efficiency, algorithmic string processing techniques may play an important role in the proposed research. Other aspects of the proposed work are related to phylogenetic problems, which have been actively studied in computer science. Theoretical study on these algorithmic problems will be conducted to obtain rigorous results that may be of interest to computer science research community.<br\/><br\/>The broader impacts of the project include interdisciplinary collaboration and training, as well as educational impacts. The developed software tools will be made available freely to the multi-disciplinary research community, and are expected to enable novel biological applications of high-throughput sequencing. The PI will develop an interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate educational curriculum at University of Connecticut.

This project investigates chip-level hardware primitives that are designed to improve the security and trust in such systems. In particular, many security mechanisms depend on a secret, unique identifier that is associated with the chip or board in the system. An embedded digital signature inserted by the manufacturer is not secure because it can be extracted by adversaries. A physical unclonable function (PUF) is a recent approach for providing an entire set of secure, unique identifiers for each chip. PUFs are chip-level primitives that leverage the intrinsic and random manufacturing variations of the process technology. A PUF that measures the resistance variations in the chip's power grid is investigated as a hardware primitive for providing secure, unique identifiers. Similarly, integrated circuit trust relates to the degree of confidence one has that a fabricated instance of a chip implements only those functions described in the original specification -- nothing more and nothing less. <br\/>There are increasing opportunities for adversaries to secretly change a chip's function given the trend of the industry to disseminate the chip fabrication process over many organizations. \"Trust but verify\" is likely the only approach to dealing with this threat. To support this verification process, a set of hardware primitives are investigated that are designed to measure the parametric, analog characteristics of chip as a means of detecting any malicious logic that might have been inserted by an adversary. A chip built in an advanced technology is used to experimentally validate the PUF and hardware Trojan detection methods.","title":"TC: Small: Collaborative Research: Exploration and Validation of Hardware Primitives for Security and Trust","awardID":"1114189","effectiveDate":"2010-07-31","expirationDate":"2014-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[484516],"PO":["565264"]},"168492":{"abstract":"Linkage reconfiguration problems underlie modern mathematical investigations in robotics, mechanical design, structural engineering, and bio-geometry, and have the potential of impacting computational biology, especially the problems emerging from modeling protein folding or, more generally, protein flexibility and motion.<br\/><br\/>This proposal focuses on the foundations of motion planning approaches to geometrically constrained structures.

Examples include expansive motions and pseudo-triangulations, motion and reconfiguration for 3D-structures (linkages, panel-and-hinge and polyhedral structures) and reconfigurations of robot arms towards extremal configurations (minima and maxima), together with a theoretical investigation of their 3D workspace.","title":"CCF- Algorithmic Foundations: Motion Planning for Geometrically Constrained Structures","awardID":"1016988","effectiveDate":"2010-07-01","expirationDate":"2014-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7929","name":"COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY"}}],"PIcoPI":["550373"],"PO":["565157"]},"167580":{"abstract":"Safely managing the release of data containing confidential information about individuals is a problem of great societal importance.

TL\/PW will present a unified connectivity face toward the West for all US R&E networks including Internet2, National Lambda Rail and Federal agency networks, enabling general and specific peerings with more than 15 international R&E links, including those funded by other NSF IRNC projects, serving scores of countries. Distributed peering services at network Layers 1, 2 and 3 will allow the project to seamlessly support domain-specific projects while remaining committed to equitable shared global R&E network services. TL\/PW will work with Internet2, National Lambda Rail, the other IRNC awardees and international networks to provide seamless evolutionary production networking services to the international research community. The value of TL\/PW to the nation and the world is demonstrated by the fact that TL\/PW is not proposing to buy new international links. Rather, TL\/PW funding will be used to provide domestic backhaul, hosting, support and facilitation for those engaged in R&E networking in the region. <br\/><br\/>TL\/PW will provide domestic support for AARNet's SX-TransPORT project, which provides two 10Gbps circuits from Australia to Hawaii to the West Coast of the U.S. on the Southern Cross Cable Network submarine fiber system. This project not only connects Australia's R&E networking community but also provides connectivity for the world's premiere setting for astronomical observatories, the summit of Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii. The Mauna Kea observatories comprise over $1 billion of international investment by 13 countries in some of the most important cyberinfrastructure resources in the world. TL\/PW will also continue to advance and support research network connections in the Australasia and Pacific regions.<br\/><br\/>The Intellectual Merit of TL\/PW derives from its championing of end-to-end connectivity and network advancement that stimulates innovation among leading domain scientists and cyberinfrastructure engineers. TL\/PW has innovated to create the world's model distributed exchange serving the global R&E networking community, and will continue to advance reliable and cost-effective global cyberinfrastructure to meet broader research and education needs. TL\/PW will focus on emerging network-enabled sustainable services, like cloud computing, and will take on a special leadership role to support major international scientific cyberinfrastructure in areas unique to its service area: astronomy and ocean observatories. TL\/PW will enable the advancement of scientific discovery, and in so doing, advance the state of cyberinfrastructure-empowered research and education.<br\/><br\/>The Broader Impact of TL\/PW will result from its sweeping enablement of US researchers to easily collaborate with their colleagues in many of the fastest-developing parts of the world.

Since networks rely on physical infrastructure (e.g., fibers and routers), they are vulnerable to natural disasters, such as earthquakes and floods, or physical attacks, such as an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) attack. This project studies the impact of a disaster or attack on the telecommunications infrastructure and develops mechanisms to mitigate their effect. The project considers events that cause a large number of failures in a specific geographical region. It uses probabilistic and geometric failure models that take into account the geography of the network and the attack characteristics. Under these models, techniques to identify the most vulnerable parts of the network are developed. Moreover, tools to provide a-priori protection plan are designed. Finally, restoration algorithms that will improve the resilience of the network are developed. The project will provide a fundamental understanding of the vulnerability of networks to disasters or attacks. It will also provide network algorithms to mitigate the impact of, and recover from, such failures. Therefore, it has the potential to significantly enhance the availability and performance of networks in the event of attacks and disasters. This is crucial for disaster recovery, especially in today?s society that is increasingly reliant on the availability of a communications infrastructure.

As these integrators are based on mechanical principles, they inherit, at the computational level, the variational nature of most mechanical systems, from particle mechanics to continuum mechanics, with surprising efficiency and robustness, and with arbitrary accuracy. Our research goal is to further develop this technique and introduce an entirely new class of Eulerian-based variational integrators of partial differential equations. By design, our geometry-based time integrators will exhibit all of the classic hallmarks of variational integrators. Consequently our research, containing intertwined theoretical and practical components, is aimed at producing simple and predictive simulation tools for a wide range of phenomena in fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, magnetohydrodynamics, plasma physics, and reactive CFD.<br\/><br\/>While the idea of discretizing variational formulations of mechanics is standard for elliptic problems, only recently was it used to derive variational time-stepping algorithms for mechanical systems. We wish to leverage the large body of literature on Lagrangian and Hamiltonian principles in mechanics to develop discrete, Eulerian-based variational integrators and further extend the realm of geometric mechanical integrators developed over the past few years. The computational and mathematical foundations sought after, along with the resulting integrators, will provide fresh insight in understanding the fundamental role of discretization and numerics in Eulerian simulations. These new computational tools will consequently advance the state-of-the-art in a wide range of challenging physical problems such as magnetohydronamics, plasma physics, charged, and complex fluids. Our team, with existing strengths in multidisciplinary computational projects and academic-industry collaborations, will develop an innovative curriculum in mathematical computing to train future scientists in theoretical and computational matters. Besides providing a stepping stone for our long-term research goal of solving complex, multiscale physical phenomena, the synergetic mixture of mechanics and geometric objects in this project promises to be a rich source of fundamental and computationally important methods, as well as interdisciplinary interactions between physical sciences, mathematics, and information technology.","title":"AF: Large: Eulerian Computational Mechanics through Variational Principles","awardID":"1011944","effectiveDate":"2010-07-01","expirationDate":"2015-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7933","name":"NUM, SYMBOL, & ALGEBRA COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":[448655,448656],"PO":["565251"]},"168352":{"abstract":"More and more large-scale real-time distributed control and data processing systems are deployed to support the nation?s infrastructures and critical services, such as power grid control, transportation monitoring systems, and water processing systems. Due to their large scale deployment, these systems pose very different requirements, compared with traditional real-time systems. They generally require soft (predictable) real-time delivery over multiple domains on dynamic networks. These requirements cannot be met using current overprovision or reservation-based solutions. This project investigates a promising solution to effectively address this issue across multiple domains. <br\/>The fundamental issues in supporting large-scale predictable real-time delivery on the Internet, by addressing the predictability in the network layer are studies here. In particular, the project explores the ready-available time synchronization technology, such as GPS, CDMA, and IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol, to achieve predictable delivery over multiple domains and dynamic paths. Two key mechanisms are developed to estimate the delay from a router to a destination and service a packet based on its upstream earliness and downstream laxness for more efficient resource sharing among partially-overlapping flows.<br\/>The results from this project will provide a viable practical solution to support large-scale distribution control systems and enable more powerful applications in power control, traffic monitoring, and energy management.

While external attacks can be neutralized through a combination of cryptography-based measures and robustness mechanisms, internal attacks, which are launched from compromised nodes, are much more sophisticated in nature. Insider adversaries exploit knowledge of network secrets (e.g., cryptographic keys and pseudo-random spreading codes) and protocol semantics to maximize their detrimental impact by selectively and adaptively targeting critical network functionalities. This project focuses on designing and evaluating secure protocols for thwarting sophisticated insider attacks of selective, adaptive, and cross-layer nature. A unified adversarial model is considered in which selective jamming and\/or dropping of high-value packets (e.g., control information) is used as the primary vehicle for denying network service. Defending wireless networks under this model is particularly challenging, because the adversary remains active for short periods of time and may adapt\/modify his strategies on the fly. The impact of insider attacks on critical network functions such as end-to-end reliable data delivery and routing is quantified via extensive experimentation and modeling. Novel protocols are developed which detect ongoing attacks and identify compromised nodes in a timely manner. Project results will reinforce the resilience of wireless networks to denial-of-service attacks launched by insiders. The proposed research is expected to have profound impacts on every wireless technology (e.g., WiFi, WSNs, MANETs, CRNs, Mesh, etc.), due to the generality of the addressed vulnerabilities.","title":"TC: Small: Enemies from Within: Thwarting Sophisticated Insider Attacks in Wireless Networks","awardID":"1016943","effectiveDate":"2010-07-15","expirationDate":"2014-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["540507","561905"],"PO":["565327"]},"168672":{"abstract":"The emerging wireless paradigm of dynamic spectrum access via cognitive radio technology has been increasingly recognized for its great potential in drastically enhancing spectrum utilization efficiency.
