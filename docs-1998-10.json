The ultimate goal of the Universal Information Access project is the full democratization of information and knowledge access, by removing -- or greatly lowering -- educational, linguistic and socio-economic barriers to effective information access and use. Progress towards this goal requires us to address the following challenges: (1) Translingual information retrieval, in order to access documents across language barriers, and across same-language jargon barriers, (2) Multi-level summarization, customized to the user's profile and information needs, (3) Automated hierarchical categorization, via high-dimensionality statistical learning methods, (4) Detection and tracking, of new topics and events of interest to each user as they unfold, and (5) Information validation as a function of source reliability and inter-source consistency. These capabilities will be integrated seamlessly into an information navigator's workstation, using a common underlying object model and a user-centric interface for visualization and management of information. These methods will be evaluated both with respect to quantitative metrics and with respect to user feedback from realistic tasks. Universal information access requires more than search engines and web browsing. For instance, much useful information may exist in languages other than English, or may come from sources of unknown reliability. Moreover, rapid analysis of information requires customized summarization, anti-redundancy filters, and hierarchical organization. Advances in these areas are beneficial to all disciplines which must cope with large volumes of rapidly growing information, such as scientific research, crisis management, international business, and improving our educational infrastructure. The proposed research, in addition to its clear impact on democratizing information access, should provide significant advances in: Information Retrieval, Machine Learning, Digital Libraries, and user-centered Information Management.","title":"KDI: Universal Information Access: Translingual Retrieval, Summarization, Tracking, Detection and Validation","awardID":"9873009","effectiveDate":"1998-10-01","expirationDate":"2006-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6845","name":"HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8876","name":"KDI OPPORTUNITY FUND"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"V573","name":"CIA-KDD NSF CROSS LANGUATE EV"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"V603","name":"CIA-HLC PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"X071","name":"DARPA-TOPIC DETECTION AND TRAC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"W525","name":"CIA-GRANT EXTENSIONS FOR KNOWL"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"1311","name":"LINGUISTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["485891","501443","562858","562859"],"PO":["565227"]},"37462":{"abstract":"This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program in Optical Bio-Molecular Engineering (OBE) that melds the more traditional areas of optical engineering, biological chemistry, and molecular biology.

As a community, we have proposals for each: we<br\/>can make the routers faster by using input-queued crossbar switches,<br\/>instead of shared memory systems; and we can introduce QoS using WFQ-based<br\/>(weighted fair queueing) packet scheduling. But we don't know how to do<br\/>both at the same time. Until now, the two solutions have been mutually<br\/>exclusive - all of the work on WFQ-based scheduling algorithms has required<br\/>that switches\/routers use output-queueing, or centralized shared memory.<br\/><br\/>The Fork-Join Router is designed to address both problems. The router is a<br\/>very high performance, scalable, fault-tolerant system designed to operate<br\/>at multi-terabits per second, yet provide exact support for qualities of<br\/>service. The router is highly parallel, and is composed of multiple,<br\/>identical, independently operating planes. When they arrive, all of the<br\/>packets belonging to the same flow are directed (forked) to the same plane<br\/>of the router for processing.

The size and varied formats for<br\/>these datasets challenge existing techniques for transmission,<br\/>storage, querying, display, and numerical manipulation, to<br\/>the point where limits on their accessibility and portability may<br\/>severely restrict their usefulness for human knowledge. This<br\/>often leads to the paradoxical situation where experiments or<br\/>numerical computations produce rich, exquisitely detailed<br\/>information, for which, at this point, no adequate analysis<br\/>tools exist. In order to address this challenge, the<br\/>investigator and his colleagues develop a new technology for data<br\/>representation based on the two basic principles of multiscale<br\/>decompositions and redundant representations. Multiscale<br\/>decompositions arrange data into strata reflecting their relative<br\/>importance. This allows for rapid access to good coarse<br\/>resolution of the data while retaining the flexibility for<br\/>increasingly fine representations. Redundant representations<br\/>allow for a multitude of data decompositions. While this on the<br\/>surface appears contrary to the need for efficiency, the<br\/>redundancy gives the flexibility of choosing `best<br\/>representations' from a unified family of representers and<br\/>thereby provides efficiency and robustness. The proposed<br\/>research is expected to deliver major results for: (i) accurate<br\/>representation of image and acoustic data, (ii) parsimonious<br\/>representation of high dimensional data, (iii) parsimonious<br\/>representation of images and volumetric objects with<br\/>singularities along curves and surfaces, (iv) acceleration of<br\/>scientific\/engineering computations.<br\/> The KDI initiative takes place at a time when intellectual<br\/>and commercial life are beginning to feel the effects of a<br\/>revolutionary combination: sensor ubiquity, computational<br\/>ubiquity, and internet connectivity. A clear priority in all<br\/>fields of commercial, engineering, and scientific endeavor must<br\/>be to identify and exploit the opportunities available in this<br\/>new era. The center of the effort should be the intensive<br\/>development of new schemes for representing digitally acquired<br\/>data, and for rapidly manipulating those representations. In<br\/>fact, advances in this central area have tremendous<br\/>repercussions, accelerating progress in every other area. For<br\/>astronomers straining to detect faint gravitational signals<br\/>coming from the farthest reaches of the universe, or looking back<br\/>in time to the earliest moments after creation, searching for<br\/>temperature fluctuations that would give clues about the central<br\/>theories of physics; for geophysicists looking for subtle<br\/>deformations in the earth's inner structure for clues about our<br\/>seismic future; for engineers developing new medical imaging<br\/>devices; even for Hollywood entrepreneurs wanting more realistic<br\/>computer graphic simulations for mass entertainment -- data<br\/>representation plays a key role. To this end, this project<br\/>assembles a team of experts to address issues of developing new<br\/>data representations and new methods of analysis and<br\/>manipulation. The premise of this venture is that significant<br\/>advances in data representation require an interdisciplinary<br\/>effort, meshing the skills and knowledge of theoreticians and<br\/>practitioners from varied fields of research that involve large<br\/>datasets. Thus, the proposed research team consists of<br\/>mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and engineers<br\/>with extensive skills and experience in the development and use<br\/>of representations for datasets. A primary component of the<br\/>project is the set of application areas in image and signal<br\/>processing, large scale computation, and computer graphics. The<br\/>project produces conceptual deliverables in the form of new<br\/>methods for storing, compressing, denoising, and querying data.<br\/>It also produces concrete deliverables in the form of algorithms<br\/>and software for use in the scientific and commercial sector. The<br\/>project serves as a national center for data representation.<br\/>Interaction between the project and other national and<br\/>international centers treating datasets is cultivated. The<br\/>project also provides a national resource for theoretical<br\/>advances, techniques of implementation, and software development.","title":"KDI: Towards Ideal Data Representations","awardID":"9872890","effectiveDate":"1998-10-01","expirationDate":"2003-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0304","name":"Division of MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES","abbr":"DMS"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0304","name":"Division of MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES","abbr":"DMS"},"pgm":{"id":"1921","name":"COLLABORATORIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0304","name":"Division of MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES","abbr":"DMS"},"pgm":{"id":"8876","name":"KDI OPPORTUNITY FUND"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":["403485","320958","550948","519450","408589"],"PO":["562372"]},"37893":{"abstract":"Collaborative Knowledge-Work Environments for Team<br\/>Science: The Space Physics and Aeronomy Research<br\/>Collaboratory (SPARC) Project<br\/><br\/>Project Summary<br\/><br\/>Interdisciplinary research experience in the collaboratory concept will be used to design, deploy, evaluate, and enlarge the fundamental understanding of collaborative knowledge-work environments.

Advances in speech technology are hampered because of incomplete understanding of these processes. Current knowledge does not successfully bridge the gap between classical approximation of speech as a linear acoustic description, and a full compressible Navier-Stokes (NS) description, which includes not only the sound propagation described in the linear model, but also the non-linear processes which produce the sound. To address this shortfall, the current research integrates three interrelated approaches for obtaining a deeper understanding of speech production: (1) synthesis of speech sounds using a NS solver, (2) experimental validation of the NS code through acoustic and fluid-dynamic measurements on a physical model, and (3) development and implementation of a reduced model of speech sound production. The expected result is speech synthesis of quality and naturalness surpassing that yet achieved, and a new model for speech generation.

However, the foundations on which the Web is built are largely ad<br\/>hoc and haphazard, with a protocol framework consisting of the hypertext<br\/>transport protocol (HTTP) layered on top of the Internet's universal<br\/>reliable delivery protocol-the transmission control protocol (TCP).<br\/>Consequently, the performance of HTTP over TCP suffers from a number of<br\/>deficiencies that are all rooted in the fact that TCP's byte-stream<br\/>semantics are often at odds with user goals and the performance<br\/>capabilities of end clients and servers.<br\/><br\/>Several ad hoc remedies have been proposed earlier to compensate for these<br\/>deficiencies, e.g. parallel connections, persistent connections, and ACK<br\/>pacing. However, all these solutions are overly constrained by the<br\/>presumption of backward compatibility. We believe that the time has come to<br\/>adopt a holistic and integrated approach embodied in a new transport<br\/>protocol tailored specifically for the Web. Herein, we propose a set of<br\/>research tasks to study, design, implement, test and evaluate our new ``Web<br\/>Transport Protocol\" or WebTP.<br\/><br\/>Our approach is based on a conceptual model of user validation, application<br\/>semantics, network and client states, and a flexible protocol that reflects<br\/>this syntax and semantics. The conceptual model emphasizes the interaction<br\/>between document structure, network state, and user preferences. Our<br\/>research prototype will leverage the well-established and highly successful<br\/>congestion control framework of TCP and vastly improve upon the existingWeb<br\/>protocols by bringing user requirements into the design loop. To do so, we<br\/>will apply the principles of Application Level Framing (ALF) to the design<br\/>of WebTP. ALF says that to optimize communication paths within the<br\/>application and across the network, an application's semantics (i.e. its<br\/>user requirements) should be explicitly reflected in the design of its<br\/>network protocol. Although ALF has been adopted in modern protocols like<br\/>the Real-time transport protocol (RTP), paradoxically it has not been<br\/>systematically applied to previously existing applications like the Web.<br\/><br\/>We will study the following questions:<br\/><br\/>* How do we best structure the ALF-based Web protocol in terms of<br\/>congestion control algorithms, loss recovery schemes, packet framing<br\/>methodology, header formats, toolkit APIs, and so forth? How do these<br\/>design decisions impact network performance, user satisfaction, protocol<br\/>complexity, and server load?<br\/><br\/>* How then does the client elicit user preferences in the least obtrusive<br\/>fashion?<br\/><br\/>* How does the receiver (client) learn of the content structure of a<br\/>server's Web data and combine that structure with its estimate of network<br\/>state and user preferences to control selective transmission via WebTP?<br\/><br\/>* How should functionality and state information be distributed among the<br\/>source (server or proxy), client, and user and what are the design and<br\/>performance tradeoffs? How does WebTP scale with increased speed and faster<br\/>clients?<br\/><br\/>Our approach to these questions draws upon network engineering and<br\/>communication theory, signal processing and stochastic control. We will<br\/>use existing network emulation infrastructure from the the INDEX Project to<br\/>comprehensively test and evaluate WebTP. This project holds the potential<br\/>to dramatically impact the way we think about Web transport and will<br\/>further contribute a design methodology, an actual protocol architecture,<br\/>and performance analysis and results.

NCAR's priorities over the next five years fall into six main areas: <br\/>(1) Fundamental Research. In keeping with the mission of NSF, the foundation of NCAR's program is fundamental research, particularly research of sufficient complexity to command the resources of a national center. This program includes solar physics, fluid dynamics and turbulence, cloud and precipitation physics, atmospheric chemistry mesoscale meteorology, and climate. <br\/>(2) Understanding and Predicting the Earth System. Building on the broad base of fundamental research, NCAR and its many university collaborators will carry out major crosscutting efforts toward understanding and predicting the earth system. This includes research on prediction of weather on short temporal and small spatial scales, longer-term prediction of monthly and seasonal means, and studies of the influence of human, solar, and other forcing processes on weather and climate.<br\/>(3) Advanced Scientific Facilities. NCAR will continue to put a high priority on developing new and cutting-edge scientific facilities that can be efficiently and cost-effectively supplied by a national center. This effort will include computing systems, instruments and observing systems, community models, datasets, advanced networking and communications tools, and provision of these facilities to the community.<br\/>(4) Human Dimensions and Societal Impacts. NCAR will place increasing emphasis on studying the impacts of climate and weather on society; on human influences on the climate system; on society's ability to cope with weather- and climate-related impacts; and on the use and value of meteorological, climate, and other atmospheric-related information in a variety of contexts. <br\/>(5) Education and Training. NCAR will continue and strengthen its efforts in education. The Advanced Study Program will support a strong postdoctoral fellowship program and graduate research assistantships to encourage the development of creativity, independence, and breadth in young scientists. Other educational activities will increase diversity in the atmospheric sciences. <br\/>(6) Applications and Technology\/Information Transfer. NCAR will transfer information, technology, and research results to the public and private sectors and to university colleagues and constituents in three major ways. Through direct transfer, public domain access to make information freely available to the broadest audience, and licensing.","title":"Support of the National Center for Atmospheric

broadly- based graduate training program that will equip students to combine the social, economic and biological sciences in the study of environmental problems presented by freshwater ecosystems. Problem areas to be emphasized will include studies of the economic value of environmental resources, the role of humans in the vulnerability of ecosystems to natural change, the impact of irreversible environmental changes, and the effect of ecosystem features on societal interactions. The project is a joint effort of 20 faculty from the Departments of Agriculture and Applied Economics, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Forest Ecology and Management, Limnology, Rural Sociology, Soil Science and Zoology. NSF support will provide stipends for 14 graduate students each year, for one postdoctoral student and for related costs of student research training. Educational opportunities will center on three required IGERT seminar courses, one on selected topics related to current IGERT faculty research, one on relevant research methods, and one on team research during which student teams will test hypotheses generated from the topics and methods seminars. Students will also spend at least three months as an intern in a Federal or Wisconsin State natural resources management agency. The postdoctoral student will both participate in and help organize the IGERT training activities, including an annual retreat for participating faculty and students. In addition to its education and research initiatives, the program plans a continuos self-evaluation effort led by a faculty member from the School of Education. IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program whose goal is to sponsor the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of new scientists and engineers to be well-prepared for varied careers in the private and public sectors. IGERT provides an opportunity for the development of new, well-focused multidisciplinary ograms that bridge traditional organizational barriers, uniting faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly-interactive collaborative environment for both training and research. In its first year, the program will provide support to 17 institutions for new or nascent programs that collectively span all areas of science, engineering and mathematics eligible for support by the NSF.","title":"IGERT: Human Dimensions of Social and Aquatic System Interactions","awardID":"9870703","effectiveDate":"1998-10-01","expirationDate":"2004-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0309","name":"Division of CHEMISTRY","abbr":"CHE"},"pgm":{"id":"1253","name":"OFFICE OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY AC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0705","name":"Division of ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND CENT","abbr":"EEC"},"pgm":{"id":"1360","name":"HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1101","name":"Division of GRADUATE EDUCATION","abbr":"DGE"},"pgm":{"id":"1335","name":"IGERT FULL PROPOSALS"}}],"PIcoPI":["499989",94796],"PO":["434633"]},"37884":{"abstract":"Poggio<br\/>9872936<br\/><br\/>The ability to learn to categorize and recognize objects is a key feature of the visual system of humans and higher animals. Yet, how the representation underlying these powerful visual abilities is organized and acquired is still largely unknown. The investigator and his colleagues tackle the problem of how the visual cortex learns to represent and recognize novel objects and object classes through a combination of computational, physiological and psychophysical approaches. The physiological experiments on alert monkeys rely on multielectrode recordings for which the investigators develop a tool kit of appropriate data mining techniques, based in part on their own work on learning and classification algorithms. In particular, the investigators undertake a multi-disciplinary research project consisting of four interacting components: i) Computational modeling of inferotemporal (IT) cortical neurons, extending their previous work on representations of single objects in IT; ii) cortical physiology using multiple electrodes in awake, behaving monkeys trained on between- and within-class classification tasks on novel classes of stimuli; iii) new data mining techniques for processing multiple electrode data, including classification and learning techniques; iv) visual psychophysics including fMRI studies in humans and monkeys, allowing to relate the findings from monkey physiology to object learning in the human brain.<br\/><br\/>Understanding learning in the human brain means understanding the very core of intelligence. Not only is this one of the remaining fundamental challenges in science but it is also one area where even small steps forward will have significant implications for understanding neurological diseases and disorders, and also for the future of computing and machine intelligence. However, despite enormous progress in the last decade or two, science does not yet know what various areas of the cortex do and how. Because understanding the brain, the most complex system we know, is a huge endeavor, the present project focuses on understanding a part of cortex, involved in a key and very difficult task in everybody's daily life -- even if subjectively very easy: learning to categorize and recognize visual objects such as faces or cars. Understanding how brain cells come to represent objects will be a major breakthrough for neuroscience and also for eventually designing machines capable of achieving human-like performance. More importantly, any significant progress in the specific problem of object recognition will have a major impact on the goals of the KDI program, because it will open the door to understanding broader issues of learning and intelligence in brains and machines.","title":"KDI: Learning of Objects and Object Classes in Visual Cortex","awardID":"9872936","effectiveDate":"1998-10-15","expirationDate":"2002-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0304","name":"Division of MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES","abbr":"DMS"},"pgm":{"id":"1266","name":"APPLIED MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"1180","name":"HUMAN COGNITION & PERCEPTION"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"5500","name":"NEURAL SYSTEMS CLUSTER"}}],"PIcoPI":["523294","415250","401913","550597","463935"],"PO":["562372"]},"34012":{"abstract":"This proposal by two principal investigators describes a three-year research plan aimed at developing a general theory of congestion control for high speed communication networks, allowing for cooperation as well as noncooperation among the users.

Technical challenges in sensing, state estimation, prediction, control and incident detection are addressed. Sensing requires real-time processing and fusing of data from loops, video cameras, probe vehicles, and cellular phones. Estimation of system state parameters (e.g. travel time distributions over numerous links) requires combining current sensor data, data from the immediate past, as well as historical data while maintaining spatial continuity constraints. Multiple scale models that can predict the evolution of system state over time and space will be developed and used to calculate real-time control actions for the available \"actuators\" (variable messages signs, ramp meters, signals) in order to improve performance. Based on learned characteristic signatures, the same models can be used to detect and classify incidents such as injury accidents with sufficient reliability to trigger appropriate responses.<br\/><br\/>The impact of this research will be to develop the core capabilities of a traffic management information system for the twenty-first century. While the current system is monitored by a variety of sensors and vast resources are dispatched to prevent system breakdown, in the absence of computational technology to estimate system state and to predict system behavior, both transportation managers and travelers make decisions as if they were blind-folded. Systems based on this research potentially offer huge benefits to both traffic managers and travelers. For traffic managers, they will provide a real-time overview of system performance and a quantitative analysis of the impact of various control options. For travelers, they can provide real-time information and advice during the planning and execution of their trips. The techniques developed in the project also potentially have application to other problems, such as air traffic control, which share many of its essential characteristics.<br\/>***","title":"KDI: Adaptive Sensing and Control of Large Systems Under Uncertainty with Application to Metropolitan-Area Freeways","awardID":"9873086","effectiveDate":"1998-10-01","expirationDate":"2002-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0701","name":"Division of ELECTRICAL, COMMUN & CYBER SYS","abbr":"ECCS"},"pgm":{"id":"1518","name":"CONTROL, NETWORKS, & COMP INTE"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0701","name":"Division of ELECTRICAL, COMMUN & CYBER SYS","abbr":"ECCS"},"pgm":{"id":"8876","name":"KDI OPPORTUNITY FUND"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0801","name":"Division of ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY","abbr":"DEB"},"pgm":{"id":"4715","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0804","name":"Division of EMERGING FRONTIERS","abbr":"EF"},"pgm":{"id":"1352","name":"GEOGRAPHY AND SPATIAL SCIENCES"}}],"PIcoPI":["515703","507305"],"PO":["564728"]},"37686":{"abstract":"EIA-9871440 Risenfeld, Richard F.

The goal is to use projection display technology to \"control light at every square millimeter, every millisecond\" to create shared immersive environments that are sufficiently realistic to give the user a sense of \"being there.\" Some aspects of this goal can be implemented by acquiring or building special-purpose research instruments and other aspects only by conducting longer-term research on more powerful general-purpose research immersive sensors and displays. This research will influence the development of advanced telecollaboration and telepresence, which is expected to become as ubiquitous in the coming decade as single-user 2D windows-based computing is today.

Understanding and controlling modern physical systems typically requires numerical simulations of multiscale dynamics that occur over a wide range of time and space scales. It is generally prohibitively expensive (e.g., a great deal of computational time) to simulate all of the scales involved in many naturally occurring phenomena. Scales outside the computable range must be described by a reduced model that conscientiously represent the effects of the unresolved degrees of freedom on the resolved scales. These models may also have constraints that provide reduced descriptions of the interactions with other systems. The goal of this study will be to develop both the model reduction techniques and new algorithms to address these problems.","title":"KDI: Structure Preserving Algorithms and Model Reduction in the Natural Sciences","awardID":"9873133","effectiveDate":"1998-10-01","expirationDate":"2002-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0301","name":"Division of PHYSICS","abbr":"PHY"},"pgm":{"id":"9134","name":"PHYSICS EDUC & INTERDISCIP RES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"06","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES             ","abbr":"GEO"},"div":{"id":"0602","name":"Division of DIV ATMOSPHERIC & GEOSPACE SCI","abbr":"AGS"},"pgm":{"id":"1520","name":"COMPUTING FACILITIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"06","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES             ","abbr":"GEO"},"div":{"id":"0602","name":"Division of DIV ATMOSPHERIC & GEOSPACE SCI","abbr":"AGS"},"pgm":{"id":"8876","name":"KDI OPPORTUNITY FUND"}}],"PIcoPI":["448655"],"PO":["337238"]},"33441":{"abstract":"This project investigates use of an additional layer of structure, called a meta-document, to organize decentralized network-accessible information, such as that found on the World-Wide Web.

Consequently meta-documents hold promise of being useful in applications where information, created and maintained by others, needs to be transferred; educational applications at all levels have this characteristic. To make meta-documents effective, basic issues in information representation, presentation, personalization, structuring, location, and exploration are explored in this project. In addition, practical study is required of the means for authoring meta-documents and the means for keeping them in synchrony with the rapidly shifting contents of the Web. The resulting concepts have theoretical implications in understanding how to structure and communicate network-based digital information.

IN the past, most of the data traffic traversing the Internet was reliable, sequenced, non real-time, and between a stationary pair of hosts. However, the next generation Internet will need to support very diverse environments (e.g., heterogeneous wireline\/wireless and mobile networks), applications (e.g., multimedia, WWW, telnet), and services (multicast, different classes of quality of service, etc.). Because applications with diverse requirements need to react differently to the dynamics of the network, the next generation Internet protocols will, of necessity, have to be more proactive in the way they deal with application-specific requirements. Additionally, new services will need to be developed and rapidly deployed for emerging applications. <br\/><br\/>In this project, we propose a novel event-drive programmable network architecture that is scalable, robust, flexible, extensible, and simple to program. Our architecture enables on-the-fly instantiation of new network services both by users and service providers, dynamic creation of virtual networks, quality of service, service advertisement, flexible network resource management, and resource arbitration among contending applications. Our goal is to make programming the network almost as simple as programming a stand-alone computer. <br\/><br\/>Our approach is to provide an event-drive view of the network. A 'virtual network' is defined by a set of services, each of which is an <event, event-handler> pair. The network provides a default set of services. Each service provider can create its own 'virtual network context', which is an instantiation of a virtual network. Virtual network contexts have a hierarchical structure, i.e., a service provide may allow users or applications to create their own virtual network contexts within the context of the service provide. Each virtual network context inherits the services of its parent context, but can customize these services or create new ones. Services can be customized either by binding an event to a different event-handler, or by creating new events (which can be triggered by other event-handlers). A network-wide 'distributed services directory' maintains a (partial) library of available and publicly disseminated services. In this model, a virtual network context can be easily customized piecemeal by changing only a few of the services relevant to a user. At the same time, it is easy to compose new services and build entire virtual networks by mixing and matching from a menu of publicly available services. <br\/><br\/>In order to make programming services simple, our architecture provides a simple programming abstraction of the distributed network state to applications, thereby reducing the complexity of developing services. A distributed network manager provides simple mechanisms for accessing, updating, caching, and locking both local and non-local network state belonging to multiple nodes in potentially heterogeneous networks. The network manager is a self-configuring distributed software based on the 'spine' infrastructure that we have developed in the past, and also provides resource management, resource allocation, and resource arbitration among top-level virtual network contexts. We believe that our combined service model and network management architecture is unique in contemporary research, and may prove to be an appropriate architecture for the next generation Internet. <br\/><br\/>In order to better understand the subtleties of the architecture and service requirements in a real environment, we will build a four cluster testbed consisting of heterogeneous wireline\/wireless networks spanning the country, with clusters located in Champaign, Chicago, Boston, and San Jose. We will build hte infrastructure in collaboration iwth Motorola, TranSwitch, and Maverick Semiconductor. The goal of htis evnvironment is to provide quality of service for unicast and multicast flows in a mobile computing environment. We choose this application environment because of its comcplexity and our previous expertise in building such environments in the context of hte traditional Internet. We believe that at the ned of this project, we iwll be able to develop an architecture that can effectively address the diverse and complex requirements of hte next generation Internet.","title":"An Event-driven Programmable Network Architecture for the Next Generation Internet","awardID":"9872785","effectiveDate":"1998-10-01","expirationDate":"2002-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1083","name":"DOMAIN NAME FUNDS"}}],"PIcoPI":["125047"],"PO":["565090"]},"27953":{"abstract":"This research develops representations and algorithms to manage large digital libraries of engineering knowledge.

The fundamental elements of this research will be to 1) study new approaches to effectively manage operational simulations and data assimilation over a distributed set of clients, 2) implement the technologies that will enable this distributed approach, and 3) evaluate these technologies using real-world experiments. The PI's envisage operational simulations to include scientific, environmental, public infrastructure, and other computer simulations that operate continuously and online, assessing the current state of a system and predicting future states. Distributed data assimilation is defined as the ability of a simulation to incorporate new sources of data dynamically while the simulation is operational. Examples include air traffic control, financial systems, and weather and ocean forecasting. The ability to easily combine simulations within and across such applications areas, asynchronously and remotely, is a goal of the proposed activity and would represent a major advance in knowledge networking and distributed intelligence.","title":"KDI: Next-Generation Agent-Based Distributed Simulation","awardID":"9873138","effectiveDate":"1998-10-01","expirationDate":"2003-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2876","name":"DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"06","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES             ","abbr":"GEO"},"div":{"id":"0602","name":"Division of DIV ATMOSPHERIC & GEOSPACE SCI","abbr":"AGS"},"pgm":{"id":"1520","name":"COMPUTING FACILITIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"06","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES             ","abbr":"GEO"},"div":{"id":"0602","name":"Division of DIV ATMOSPHERIC & GEOSPACE SCI","abbr":"AGS"},"pgm":{"id":"8876","name":"KDI OPPORTUNITY FUND"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0706","name":"Division of DESIGN & MANUFACTURING INNOV","abbr":"DMI"},"pgm":{"id":"1464","name":"ENGINEERING DESIGN AND INNOVAT"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0801","name":"Division of ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY","abbr":"DEB"},"pgm":{"id":"1198","name":"Biodiversity: Discov &Analysis"}}],"PIcoPI":[96339,"251412","494936"],"PO":["337238"]},"27766":{"abstract":"The research focuses on two topics in Applied Cryptography: efficient generation of shared RSA keys and the bit security of the Diffie-Hellman secret. To protect a high security private key one may wish to share it among a few sites. If a small number of sites are compromised no harm is done. An obvious question is who generates the shared key? Traditionally, a \"trusted dealer\" generates an RSA key pair and then splits the private key among the sites. This project studies various protocols for enabling three or more parties to efficiently generate a shared RSA key WITHOUT a trusted dealer. At the end of the computation the participants have an RSA modulus N=pq. They are all convinced that N is the product of two large distinct primes; however no proper coalition knows the factorization of N. The protocols should be appropriate for small, low bandwidth devices such as smartcards or Personal Digital Assistants (PDA's). The project's second topic is the bit security of the Diffie- Hellman secret. The Diffie-Hellman protocol enables two parties to exchange a secret. Although an adversary may not be able to compute the entire secret, she may be able to infer certain information about it. The proposed research will provide bounds on the amount of information an adversary can infer. To do so one shows that if an adversary can recover certain bits of the Diffie-Hellman secret then she can also break the entire protocol. The techniques needed for such reductions involve lattices and the LLL algorithm.","title":"Efficient Sharing of RSA Keys and Diffie-Hellman Bit Security","awardID":"9732754","effectiveDate":"1998-10-01","expirationDate":"2001-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["521488"],"PO":["528421"]},"37479":{"abstract":"9870713 Staley This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a broadly- based graduate training program in study of life in extreme environments and on its relevance to understanding the evolution of life on earth and, potentially, on other planets.

The multidisciplinary program will be the joint effort of 14 faculty from the Departments of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Astronomy, Atmospheric Sciences, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Genetics, Geological Sciences, Geophysics, Microbiology and Oceanography, as well as internship mentors in the private and public sector. NSF support will provide stipends for 11 graduate students each year, and for related costs of student research training. Students will take at least three of five new courses to be created for the IGERT program, and must complete existing coursework requirements of their home departments. Required coursework will emphasize current knowledge of the evolution of life from prebiotic synthesis through development of Eukaryotic cells, and the physical and chemical principles of planetary formation. Along with participating faculty, students will participate in a weekly IGERT seminar and an annual workshop at a field site or laboratory that will focus on methods and techniques not available on campus. IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program whose goal is to sponsor the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of new scientists and engineers to be well-prepared for varied careers in the private and public sectors. IGERT provides an opportunity for the development of new, well-focused multidisciplinary programs that bridge traditional organizational barriers, uniting faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly-interactive collaborative environment for both training and research.

University of Colorado at Boulder ESS: COIL: A Common Object Interconnection Language to Support Database Integration and Evolution Commercial information management technology is about to undergo a massive developmental phase. The emerging global economy has created a dramatic demand for distributed database technology, so that far-flung corporations can manage information that is strewn across dozens or hundreds of incompatible databases. The development of high-bandwidth networking technology has provided the infrastructure for supporting such distributed databases. What is missing is the software to make effective use of this hardware. Currently available software allows data to be accessed regardless of its physical location, but does not provide significant support for interrelating databases that are incompatible in the way they structure data and in the terminology used to describe data. Simply put, current software allows databases to be located at multiple physical places around the globe, but cannot effectively resolve semantic differences. The COIL (Common Object Interconnection Language) project has as its goal the development of a computer language for programming and rapidly evolving interconnections between multiple, incompatible databases. The COIL programming language will allow software applications using mainstream relational database products (such as Oracle, Sybase, and Microsoft Access) to be interconnected.

Collaboration is a hallmark of human activity. But today's society is becoming global, and digital networking-both wired and wireless-aims to serve geographically-dispersed participants. Networks of computers now become a mediating tool in human collaboration. And, their distributed architecture provides new opportunities for expanding human intellect and for enhancing knowledge work. But to be maximally useful the mediating system must be easy to use-preferably transparent to the user. Communication between human and machine should approach the naturalness of face-to-face exchange, where the sensory modalities of sight, sound and touch carry primary responsibilities for information transport. Additionally, supporting software must include intelligent agents able to fuse sensory data into meaningful commands for the machines. New technologies, now evolving, promise greater naturalness in human\/machine communication-naturalness that substantially transcends the limitations of traditional mouse and keyboard. Incorporated with audio and video conferencing, these techniques include: eye tracking, visual gesture, hands-free speech recognition, speech synthesis, force-feedback tactile grasp, and manual gesture. Used in natural combination, these modalities provide the human greater dimensions of control and communication, and hence greater effectiveness in networked collaboration.<br\/><br\/>This new research, aims to establish the basic understanding necessary for the creation and use of multimodal computer interfaces in wired and wireless networks. The research aims to produce a design methodology for multi-user collaboration across heterogeneous architectures and computing environments. As multimodal capabilities evolve, human performance must be addressed as a recognized component of the total system. Optimization of design therefore includes human-factors assessment to quantify the synergies that can be won from multimodal interaction.

DNA sequence data now needs to be translated, into functional information. The first step is the prediction of the function of individual gene products from their sequence through comparison with other known genes and genomes. The second step, and perhaps the more challenging one, involves the use of this functional information on individual genes to predict cellular functions resulting from their coordinated activity. In order to accomplish the objectives of this second step, model in silico organisms need to be built based on genomic data, and systems analysis methods developed to describe them so as to analyze, interpret, and predict the genotype-phenotype relationship. <br\/>At present there is no computational infrastructure available to address these challenges. This project addresses this overall question by the following two methods: <br\/>1. Structural and steady state analysis methods will be developed to formulate organism-scale metabolic networks from annotated sequence data. These analysis methods will be presented within the Biology WorkBench (bioweb.ncsa.uiuc.edu). This capability will include the development of a graphical user interface that shows the metabolic map for a genomically defined metabolic genotype and the display of flux balance solutions thereon. Flux balance methods will be developed to study the characteristics and capabilities of defined genotypes, including the variation in the genotype, prediction of metabolic shifts, prediction of genome scale expression, and formulation of defined media, <br\/>2. To characterize the dynamic characteristics of multi-enzyme systems, methods will be developed to catalog, interpolate, and predict enzyme kinetic properties. These methods can be used to assign enzyme kinetic properties to annotated genome sequences. Methods will also be developed for temporal decomposition of a large set of simultaneous metabolic reactions. These methods will be able to determine the independent modes of motion in complex systems, give a physiological interpretation of these modes, and to predict the pool transformation matrix that can subsequently be used for model reduction for description on a selected time scale.<br\/><br\/>The results of this research will form the basis for the needed computational infrastructure for the formulation and testing of in silico metabolic representations of living cells. Basically, the result is the important metabolic genotype-phenotype relationship, and means to analyze, interpret, and predict it.

Learning theory can be extended through the study of the evolution of different types of knowledge representations together with procedural representations. Thus, this research will examine learning, the change in students' knowledge representations, as they integrate multiple sources of information.<br\/><br\/>Although ITSs have been developed to examine learning for well-defined problems requiring a limited set of possi-ble responses, ITSs have had problems evaluating open-ended questions that require the student to provide natural language responses. However, asking students to provide written answers to essay questions can provide a much richer representation of student knowledge and also improving students' writing abilities. Thus, this research will demonstrate that ITSs can be developed which extend beyond simple responses and that these ITSs can adapt more readily to provide individualized instruction to students. In order to develop these ITSs, this research uses the computational linguistic technique Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to model student knowledge representations from essay-based answers within tutoring systems.<br\/><br\/>As students' knowledge representations change, so too should their essay responses, including more knowledge and improving in quality. Therefore such an ITS can provide the necessary feedback for student improvement (both in domain knowledge and in writing skill). In addition, the ITS can initially assess the students' ability and provide extra help to the students with help gradually fading as the student gains more knowledge (e.g., scaffold-ing). Thus, by incorporating LSA into an ITS, individualized instruction is possible for adjusting both the level of feedback provided and the content presented. The goal of this research is thus to study the acquisition of complex skills through incorporating LSA, a method for representing students' knowledge representations through their essays, into intelligent tutoring systems.<br\/><br\/>Because this research focuses on complex skills from knowledge-rich domains, results from this project extend theories of learning in psychology by providing information about how multiple sources of knowledge are integrated into students' knowledge representations as they are learning . The research also has theoretical implications for educational psychology including the systematic examination of scaffolding for two content areas. In addition, because LSA is an automatic method for deriving knowledge representations, this research has broad implications for developing systems for training in any area of content knowledge.","title":"KDI: Learning Through Writing Using Adaptive Tutoring Systems: Modeling Knowledge Representations from Open-Ended Questions","awardID":"9873491","effectiveDate":"1998-10-01","expirationDate":"2003-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"1180","name":"HUMAN COGNITION & PERCEPTION"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1109","name":"Division of RESEARCH ON LEARNING","abbr":"DRL"},"pgm":{"id":"8888","name":"LEARNING & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":[96442,"355342","253901"],"PO":["564412"]},"34017":{"abstract":"Looking up the route to send a message is a major bottleneck in traditional<br\/>Internet Routers.

Layer Four<br\/>Switching unifies a number of recent trends (such as firewall processing,<br\/>resource reservation, providing virtual private networks) into a single<br\/>framework. The forwarding database of this new kind of router consists of<br\/>a potentially large number of filters on key header fields.

Working memory refers to the active maintenance of information in the service of complex cognitive tasks such as problem solving and planning. The team of investigator with study how the unique demands placed on the working memory system shape its representations during learning and development, and how these representations affect the use of working memory by the cognitive system as a whole. Their primary source of insight into this process will come from a computational analysis, which will be used to integrate and explore relevant findings from neurobiology and developmental and adult cognition. The primary hypothesis is that to maintain information in an active state over delays and in the face of interference, working memory representations should be discrete. A discrete representation admits to only a finite set of possible states, rather than representing continuous states. For example, the integers from 1 to 100 form a discrete set, in contrast to the real numbers in this range. Discreteness imparts a measure of robustness to the representation because small amounts of \"noise\" can be overcome by interpreting an observed state as the nearest discrete stat. From the central property of discreteness, a number of other properties follow. For example, discrete representations should be more categorical, more easily verbalize, better for perceiving or performing a sequence of steps, and more accessible to awareness. All these properties have component of the proposed research is to explore the idea that they all follow from the more basic property of dicreteness. The initial goal of the project will be establish through experimental studies the validity of the hypothesis that working memory representations are indeed discrete. This will be done by exploring a key behavioral consequence of this hypothesis: working memory representations should be more categorical than other representations. This predicition will be investigated with a set of existing empirical paradigms that have elucidated variables that affect the working memory system, including developmental age, delay, dual-task demands, and brain damage. Working memory plays a central role in most accounts of complex human behavior, because working memory is required in any task that involves multiple stos ir a temporally extended focus of attention. This kinds of tasks are important and pervasive throughout society, including: economic, political, and military planning; air-traffic control; and scientific research, to name just a few. It is essential to understand the nature of the representations in the working memory system and to understand how people learn to use working memory in the service of complex behavior. This research will advance our knowledge in this important area, and may provide insight into techniques for rehabilitation of working memory following brain injury and techniques for assisting the development of working memory in children.","title":"KDI: Discrete Representations in Working Memory: Developmental, Neuropsychological, and Computational Investigations","awardID":"9873492","effectiveDate":"1998-10-01","expirationDate":"2002-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6856","name":"ARTIFICIAL INTELL & COGNIT SCI"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"1180","name":"HUMAN COGNITION & PERCEPTION"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"5500","name":"NEURAL SYSTEMS CLUSTER"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"8888","name":"LEARNING & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["276782","533910",96448,96449],"PO":[96450]},"29739":{"abstract":"The goal of this research is to develop a representation and algorithms that characterize diagnostic reasoning. Human experts in a problem domain frequently interpret data in that domain in the context of a particular causal hypothesis. This type reasoning contrasts with deductive inference where from a set of general rules and facts further information is deduced by sound inference rules. Diagnostic reasoning, often called abductive inference, however, moves from a set of facts to the \"best explanation\" for the existence of these facts. This process often requires the expert to make a hypothetical conjecture that would explain the facts and then search for specific new information that can confirm that conjecture. Thus the human expert searches through a space of possible explanations for the observed information. This research uses Bayesian Belief Networks to build causal models of a domain. This approach represents in a precise way the interrelationship of causal patterns and their use in moving towards an explanation.

This project will improve understanding of how collaborative learning is facilitated by computer software with which learners construct and manipulate visual representations of their emerging knowledge. \"Representational bias\" refers to how these software environments facilitate the expression and inspection of different kinds of information.<br\/><br\/>In this project, students will use four software environments for recording and organizing hypotheses and empirical observations while investigating a recent scientific problem. The software environments will each provide users with a different representational device, namely threaded discussion lists, nested boxes, graphs, and matrices. Students' talk, gestures, and use of the software will be transcribed and analyzed to identify the concepts that students use and the types of knowledge that student seek and discuss, testing specific predictions concerning how the representational bias of each of the four representational devices affect learning processes. Learning outcomes will also be assessed. Studies will be undertaken with both secondary school students working side by side in front of a computer and with college students collaborating remotely in a distance learning paradigm.<br\/><br\/>The research will provide a better theoretical understanding of the role of representational bias in guiding collaborative learning and problem solving processes.

These theories have achieved major successes in many widely used systems. However, it has remained a challenge to create systems that integrate the analysis of low-level concrete sensor data and motor control with the use of high-level, more abstract representations of perception and action. The investigators on our team propose to attack this central issue with a variety of approaches. We believe that a very promising tool is the systematic study of hierarchical compositional data structures, in which larger scale more abstract objects are built up in stages from small-scale concrete objects. This compositional approach applies to making decisions as well as to perception: subtasks may be composed into larger tasks and reasoned with as units. Doing reasoning in such hybrid systems, it is essential that ambiguity and multiple alternatives be maintained as long as possible. For example, this means not choosing between inconsistent high-level interpretations of a signal until larger scale context is available; or replacing a local 'greedy algorithm' decision by a dynamic programming-style list of optimal conditional decisions. We discuss the role of learning in such hierarchical layered systems. Understanding, the interaction between information and control in such layered systems is a critical research issue<br\/><br\/>We plan to concentrate our research on the following aspects of layered intelligent systems:<br\/>(i) the role of the compositional and hierarchical approach in language and speech recognition; (ii) hierarchical decision making in layered systems; (iii) learning of hierarchical concepts; and (iv) interaction information and control in distributed systems.

Protein structure is, of course, fundamental to protein function, but equally important are the internal thermal motions that a protein continually undergoes. The basic problem is that protein structure is so complicated, and proteins have so many potential ways to move, that it is impossible to do a \"brute force\" simulation of all the possible protein motions and catalog their effects. The solution is to break the problem of describing protein motion into a hierarchy of problems, and treat each level of the hierarchy separately, moving from the most detailed to more \"coarse-grained\" descriptions. In each case, the numerical results from the most detailed calculation will be used as parameters for a more coarse-grained calculation. In order to predict function from structure, three levels of description will be developed: 1) quantum chemistry, 2) classical molecular dynamics, and 3) kinetic theory. The results from the kinetic theory will be compared directly with experiment.

Neuroinorphic systems offer a platform for integrating insights from mathematics, neurobiology, and Computer simulation, and represent a new type of neural-based computing. Our approach arises from the premise that the traditional components of intelligence (including Sy requires a new technology; this technology will be provided by together as an integrated system. The study of such complex learning, recognition, and attention) are Properties of a common underlying neural structure, and that these compo ents are best studied neuromorphic systems engineering. Ncuromorphic VLSI chips stems and systems use subthreshold analog circuits to model dendritic computation and asynchronous digital circuits to model axonal communication . These systems can function autonomously or be interfaced with conventional computers. Neuromozphic systems offer the possibility of learning and recognition on real-time, real-world problems such as visual search and the recognition of biological motion.<br\/>Our approach is based on spike-based computation: use of the precise timing of ncuronal spikes for representation and computation. Spike-based computations underlie some of the most impressive behaviors in biology, from bat sonar to human vision. In particular, we will focus on neuronal synchronization and will develop models in which learning, attention, and recognition all operate through effects on synchronization. Such models require neural mechanisms for the detection of synchronization (Recognition), enhancement of synchronization (Learning), and dynamic modulation of synchronization (Attention).<br\/>We will use a team approach in which faculty and students work together on linked projects. The four investigators have expertise in complementary areas: neuromorphic chip design (Boahen), cellular biophysics and neural network simulation (Finkel), physiological data analysis and modeling (Gerstein), theoretical analysis of learning and spikebascd computation (Hopficid). Together we %ill investigate mechanisms for the control of synchronization based on changes in neuromodulation, on selective modification of<br\/>AMPA\/NMDA conductance ratios, on temporallyasyminetric synaptic plasticity, and on synaptic delay and spike-frequency adaptation. These simulations @l be tied to analysis of synchronization in spike-train recordings from awake, behaving animals engaged in learning, attention, or recognition tasks. Analysis of physiological and psychophysical data will motivate development of theoretical models of spike-based computation. Most critically, development of a series of neuromorphic chips will be carried out as a means of scaling up the simulations to systems containing over 200,000 spiking neurons each making thousands of connections. To facilitate development and sharing of ideas, we will develop a common simulation environment for analysis of spiking neurons that will allow an interface between large-scale network simulation, neuromorphic chip design, and analysis and prediction of physiological recordings. This enviroranent will be made available (via the Web) for widcr use by physiologists and modelers, and as an educational tool.<br\/>Our current retina-based neuromorphic chips (Boahen, 1998) outperform CCD technology as a result of ncurally-derived mechanisms. These chips incorporate biological mechanisms for local gain control and motion detection. Prototype systems of interconnected spikegenerating chips will allow real-time feedback control of connectivity. We outline a plan for interfacing cortically-based ncuromorphic systems with high-speed multiprocessors to allow real-time attention, recognition, and learning on continuous video input streams. Recent ncurophysiological studies suggest that neuronal responses in alert animals viewing rcal-iiorld environments differ radically from responses to simplified stimuli. Such results argue for the study of neural-based systems interacting with real-world environments.<br\/>The outcome of these studies will be tools, technology and insights that provide a new domain of interaction between neuroscientists, computer scientists and mathematicians and engineers. They will yield insight into the spike-based computations underlying intelligent behavior. The technology developed will have immediate application to robotics and intelligent neural prostheses.","title":"KDI: Neuromorphic Knowledge Systems","awardID":"9873463","effectiveDate":"1998-10-15","expirationDate":"2003-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6856","name":"ARTIFICIAL INTELL & COGNIT SCI"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0701","name":"Division of ELECTRICAL, COMMUN & CYBER SYS","abbr":"ECCS"},"pgm":{"id":"1518","name":"CONTROL, NETWORKS, & COMP INTE"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0701","name":"Division of ELECTRICAL, COMMUN & CYBER SYS","abbr":"ECCS"},"pgm":{"id":"8876","name":"KDI OPPORTUNITY FUND"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"5500","name":"NEURAL SYSTEMS CLUSTER"}}],"PIcoPI":[96412,96413,96414,"318078"],"PO":["564728"]},"30854":{"abstract":"9804100 The research addresses the verification of properties of infinite-state reactive systems, which have an ongoing interaction with their environment. Reactive systems include hardware, software, and real-time and hybrid systems. Their computations can be modeled as infinite sequences of states, and their properties conveniently expressed using temporal logic. Except for untimed hardware, where a state depends on a fixed number of bits, these systems are infinite-state: not only is a computation an infinite sequence of states, but the set of possible system states is infinite as well. Abstraction underlies virtually all deductive and algorithmic verification techniques for infinite-state systems.The algorithmic methods explore finite quotients of the state-space, which are often incrementally refined. Deductive verification rules can also be understood as using an appropriate abstraction, expressed using intermediate assertions. When applied to software systems, the main challenge in both cases is to find the right abstraction that will allow the verification of the properties of interest. Compositional verification reduces the validity of a property over a complex system to that of related properties over smaller components. Compositionality is often used together with abstraction to verify systems larger than would otherwise be possible. The research investigates new forms of abstraction and compositional reasoning, combining algorithmic and deductive methods. They will facilitate the verification of temporal properties of software components, automating the process whenever possible.***","title":"Abstraction and Compositionality for the Verification of Infinite-State Reactive Systems","awardID":"9804100","effectiveDate":"1998-10-01","expirationDate":"1999-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}}],"PIcoPI":["309451"],"PO":["150697"]},"32658":{"abstract":".Abstract <br\/>ANI - 9810141<br\/>PI: Larry E Druffel<br\/>South Carolina Research Authority<br\/><br\/><br\/>This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's \"Connections to the Internet\" announcement, NSF 96-64.

Such a project is possible because of significant experimental advances in our understanding of motor control systems in humans and other animals, and because of increased sophistication in our mathematical models of control learning. These models will be used not only to analyze and predict natural phenomena in motor control, but also to derive effective adaptive controllers for artificial systems carrying out complex tasks.<br\/>To generate complex behaviors, natural and artificial systems must be organized hierarchically with multiple layers of abstraction. The first research task will therefore be to identify appropriate levels of representation at which the physical system can be modclled and at which control actions can be defined. For example, in describing an insect flying from A to B, possible levels might be 1) nerve signals and mechanical properties controlling the detailed shaping of each wingbcat 2) basic wingbeat cycle 3) 11 steering\" the cycle to direct flight 4) takeoff, navigation, landing. Detailed motion, force, and\/or airflow measurements will be made under a variety of experimental circumstances and tasks to establish the correspondence between formal models and physical systems. These experiments will be carried out for a variety of organisms, possibly including flying in insects, running in cockroaches, and for running, diving, and throwing in humans. These studies (and, in the case of insects, neurophysiological studies) will also establish the sensory inputs that are available at each level of the control system.<br\/>Given the general structure of the control system and the appropriate sensory inputs, the next step is to design learning algorithms capable of learning to perform the given task successfully. The learning method to be used is reinforcement learning, a technique designed to adjust the control algorithm to optimize an objective function-that is, the long-term accumulated value of a specified reward signal. The reward is supplied to the learning algorithm as part of the sensory input. New reinforcement learning algorithms will be developed that operate using both local and global reward signals within a hierarchical control structure; furthermore, these algorithms will be proved to converge even using nonlinear representations of the overall objective function. This research should shed light on the central question of whether this form of learning in animals and humans can be viewed as driven by optimization or by some other principle, such as the preservation of fixed interface characteristics among the various levels of the system. Discovery of consistent reward functions in animals, especially humans, would have significant consequences for general theories of learning.","title":"KDI: Learning Complex Motor Tasks in Natural and Artifical Systems","awardID":"9873474","effectiveDate":"1998-10-01","expirationDate":"2002-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6856","name":"ARTIFICIAL INTELL & COGNIT SCI"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0701","name":"Division of ELECTRICAL, COMMUN & CYBER SYS","abbr":"ECCS"},"pgm":{"id":"1518","name":"CONTROL, NETWORKS, & COMP INTE"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0703","name":"Division of CIVIL, MECHANICAL, & MANUFACT","abbr":"CMMI"},"pgm":{"id":"1266","name":"APPLIED MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"1180","name":"HUMAN COGNITION & PERCEPTION"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"5500","name":"NEURAL SYSTEMS CLUSTER"}}],"PIcoPI":[96425,"401938","346555","420868","526900"],"PO":["564728"]},"37908":{"abstract":"Wheeler<br\/>9873326<br\/><br\/>Fluid flows at and below the earth's surface are the cause and cure for problems of water and soil pollution, while petroleum and natural gas production depends on flows in the subsurface. In these problems, the length scales of practical interest range from tens of meters to kilometers. However, the behavior at these scales depends critically on physics occurring at much smaller length scales. A wide disparity in time scales also exists in these problems. Moreover, different physical processes occur simultaneously in different parts of the domain. In this project, the investigators and their university, government and industrial collaborators develop much-needed scientific understanding of small-scale phenomena from theory and experiment, and also develop new computational tools and strategies for incorporating this understanding at the practical scale, for handling multiple types of physics across subdomains, for remote collaboration, and for visualizing and manipulating the results. The project focuses on better understanding of small-scale phenomena (e.g., multiphase interfacial area, hysteresis, dispersion, and discrete fractures in porous media), interdomain coupling by means of multiblock or multiphysics methodologies (e.g., coupling of surface water and groundwater environments), the development of accurate and efficient algorithms and prototype simulators, and methods for viewing results interactively and with collaborators off site. The algorithms and simulators developed include novel mortar type spaces for coupling domains, and sophisticated, adaptive, finite element, finite volume and time-stepping methods for modeling nonlinear advective, diffusive and reactive processes. The algorithms are implemented on parallel computing platforms. Interactive steering and visualization are coupled closely to the simulators. Important work related to this project are laboratory experiments and field data for critical evaluation of the simulators, demonstration of prototypical simulators on petroleum engineering production models and environmental subsurface and surface flow applications, and educational and professional outreach and training through workshops, video and web-based technologies.<br\/><br\/>This project concerns computer simulation and prediction of the movement and interaction of fluids in surface waters and subsurface groundwater and petroleum reservoirs. The focus is on fundamental multiscale and multiphysics applications (i.e., physical processes occurring together at different length and time scales and different physical processes occurring in different parts of the spatial domain). The motivation behind this work is the need to better understand and quantify the effect of small-scale processes on larger, field-scale processes, and to understand how different physical processes occurring in close proximity affect each other. The investigators study these problems through the development of appropriate mathematical models, numerical algorithms, computational science and visualization tools, and laboratory experiments. This work is carried out in collaboration with other university researchers and government and industrial partners. Educational outreach and training of future scientists and engineers is an important part of this effort. The applications of interest include petroleum and natural gas production, groundwater contamination and remediation, surface water circulation and pollution, and the interaction between surface and groundwater environments. These applications have significant environmental and economic impact.","title":"KDI: Multiscale Physics-Based Simulation of Fluid Flow for Energy and Environmental Applications","awardID":"9873326","effectiveDate":"1998-10-01","expirationDate":"2002-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0304","name":"Division of MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES","abbr":"DMS"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0304","name":"Division of MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES","abbr":"DMS"},"pgm":{"id":"8876","name":"KDI OPPORTUNITY FUND"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"4080","name":"ADVANCED COMP RESEARCH PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"06","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES             ","abbr":"GEO"},"div":{"id":"0603","name":"Division of EARTH SCIENCES","abbr":"EAR"},"pgm":{"id":"1579","name":"HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0705","name":"Division of ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND CENT","abbr":"EEC"},"pgm":{"id":"1415","name":"PARTICULATE &MULTIPHASE PROCES"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0706","name":"Division of DESIGN & MANUFACTURING INNOV","abbr":"DMI"},"pgm":{"id":"1464","name":"ENGINEERING DESIGN AND INNOVAT"}}],"PIcoPI":["521249","517319","521182","455262","251241"],"PO":["562372"]},"37909":{"abstract":"9873339<br\/>Caramanis<br\/><br\/>The project will use the manufacturing environment as a paradigm for modeling and studying problems in distributed and hierarchical control under uncertainty. The primary objective of this project is to investigate and propose solutions to computational challenges that are the result of the proliferation of technologies which give rise to stochastic large-scale systems of unprecedented complexity. The second objective is to develop solutions and methodologies that not only meet the needs of the manufacturing supply chain coordination problem, but are general enough to be able to explore their impact on other areas of science and technology.<br\/><br\/>The manufacturing enterprise is one consisting of multiple, but highly interconnected, hierarchical layers. The size, nonlinearity, and stochasticity of manufacturing systems renders effective, let alone optimal, centralized decision making intractable. The approach followed in the past has been to relate the system's state to a number of variables, e.g., randomness, decision vector, cost, and then solve for decoupled components in a decentralized decision framework. This produces tractable, but inefficient, decision rules because of the assumptions made to allow solutions.<br\/><br\/>The goal of this research is to achieve systematic coordination of decentralized decision entities without compromising tractability of the problem.
