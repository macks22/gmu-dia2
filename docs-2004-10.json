This project focuses on exploiting the substantial number of degrees of freedom that are increasingly available at the physical layer to design and build multihop wireless networks with enhanced capacity, robustness, and usability. Our central objective is to identify how to best leverage these tradeoffs and experiment with complementary medium access control (MAC) protocols that are capable of doing so.<br\/><br\/>Our approach is an integrated one that focuses on cross-layer algorithm design and implementation. The focus is three fold: one, the development of a multi-hop wireless network prototype testbed - Hydra; two, the design and implementation of adaptive physical layer (PHY) modulation and coding schemes that significantly increase PHY flexibility; and three, the design and implementation of novel medium access control (MAC) algorithms that efficiently exploit the flexibility offered by next-generation PHYs. Our approach crosses the boundaries between both the physical layer and the networking layers and between theory and practice.<br\/><br\/>Perhaps the greatest impact of our work comes from designing and building a working prototype. This allows us to generate results that are extremely well grounded in physical reality, taking us away from the simulation-oriented approach that currently dominates wireless networking. These results will help to enable more effective wireless networks, especially those where data takes multiple wireless hops. We will disseminate our results through the production of students as well as the usual publication venues.","title":"NeTS - ProWiN: Collaborative Research: Exploiting Flexible PHYs in Networks: Prototype and Algorithms","awardID":"0435041","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2007-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["563559"],"PO":["7594"]},"97817":{"abstract":"Intellectual Merit<br\/>Progress has been made in producing single photon states.

Overlays facilitate the deployment of functions not available from the commercial Internet (e.g., multicasting, QoS-aware routing etc.). While conventional overlays so far have connected stationary users, the overlays of the future must support also mobile customers. There is need for hybrid wired and wireless overlays that include wireless segments and even \"opportunistic\" ad hoc networks (e.g., networks of cars in an urban environment). <br\/>To respond to such needs, this project develops OverProbe, a new toolkit that includes the innovative probing technique CapProbe and works for both wired and wireless overlay links. OverProbe evaluates \"virtual link\" quality very rapidly. Speed is critical in wireless since the user at the end of the path may move across different type of wireless media (e.g., 3G, 802.11, Bluetooth, CDMA, etc.) within minutes. Besides frequent monitoring of wireless connectivity, the toolkit assists mobile users in soft handoff without breaking TCP connections. The research also includes the design and evaluation of scalable, hierarchical overlay structures (using \"backbone overlays\"). <br\/>The results of this research will help promote new services among the mobile community, from telecommuting, to e-commerce and entertainment. Key results include: (1) A set of path probing methodologies and tools (Over-Probe toolkit). (2) A two level overlay and proxy architecture. (3) OverProbe implementation in PlanetLab and WHYNET.","title":"NeTS - Collaborative Research - NR: Over-Probe: a Toolkit for the Management of Overlay Networks with Mobile Users","awardID":"0435230","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2008-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["526410"],"PO":["434241"]},"105743":{"abstract":"Current technologies for radiationbased treatment of cancerous tumors rely almost exclusively on diagnostic<br\/>images such as MRI and PET scans to enable a careful targeting of multiple high-intensity beams.<br\/>However, the very complex nature of the penetration of radiation energy into the biological tissue makes such targeting difficult and error-prone, possibly even prohibiting radiative treatment due to the risk of damaging essential tissue in close proximity to the cancerous areas.

These systems use large stand-by reserves to manage the variations in operating conditions and equipment status. When the system is under stress, reserves make up for lack of flexible decision making. Current modeling, monitoring, and decision tools assume that system response to disturbances is local, and that it is also locally manageable without on-line coordination. While these tools generally result in reliable operations, the occasional costly and life-threatening blackouts, explosions, and water main breaks are proof that the tools and \"conservative\" operating practices can fail. Continued growth, technology change, aging equipment, and regulatory changes alter the system, making the old models and practices less reliable. Operating these infrastructure systems to achieve higher performance along with greater reliability and security requires advances in modeling, simulating, and operating complicated systems. This project focuses on the electricity grid, using the widely accepted representations. While simplifications of reality, these representations of the infrastructure grid are highly complex models. The project research treats the following important issues: (1) Handling Complexity. The project develops layers of simpler models that run in real time and capture different time and space resolution scales, with a \"systems manager\" layer that corrects for the \"externalities\" caused by approximate decomposition. (2) Monitoring. A network using sparse sensors strategically placed measures the most relevant data at the location of impact. (3) Characterization of the System Dynamics. Unlike the state-of-the-art static state estimators used in current power grids, this project develops a \"quasi-dynamic state estimator\" (QDSE) that uses the current knowledge (estimate) of the state to update the current estimate of the network state.

To simplify computation and allow the model to run in near real time, models are decomposed using a \"systems manager\" to correct for the externalities arising from inexact decomposition. An Interplay of physical, financial\/economic, regulatory, and IT signals drives the complex infrastructure system. These general concepts are applied to the electric power infrastructure, which has recently been challenged for its lack of reliability and inability to support efficient markets. This project demonstrates the outlined techniques by assessing the performance of several candidate architectures of the evolving electric power industry.","title":"ITR - \\(ASE+NHS\\) -\\ (dmc+int\\): Toward a Multi-Layered Architecture for Reliable and Secure Large-Scale Networks: The Case of an Electric Power Grid","awardID":"0428404","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2010-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7314","name":"ITR FOR NATIONAL PRIORITIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7371","name":"CYBER TRUST"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"H184","name":"National Security Agency"}}],"PIcoPI":["317052",257731,"460548","563201","451785"],"PO":["561889"]},"103721":{"abstract":"This is a proposal for a grant to promote service-learning as a model for the dissemination of Information Technology Literacy (ITL). Service-learning promotes mutually beneficial partnerships between academic institutions and communities. One goal is to empower communities to identify ITL needs that students can fulfill as part of their education. This grant would enable two central Iowa universities--Drake and Iowa State--to reach out to communities in need of ITL training and to assess the efficacy of service-learning interventions. Citizens are increasingly expected to interface with government using IT (ex. firstgov.gov). A number of studies have identified unequal levels of ITL as a significant barrier to equity in citizenship. While access to the Internet steadily expands, the ability to take advantage of increasing access hinges on the level of ITL among citizens. Community members, particularly in certain more vulnerable groups, often lack basic skills and concepts required when navigating an expanding electronic interface with government. Whereas IT should make it easier for all citizens to conduct their routine business with the government, in fact, it appears to be widening the gap between the IT literate and those without basic navigational skills. The primary objective of this research project is to test the efficacy of service-learning programs that seek to universalize digital citizenship. Three related objectives are to:<br\/><br\/> Define Information Technology Literacy (ITL) using broad and systematic criteria.<br\/> Develop, implement, and evaluate \"best practices\" for using service-learning in the dissemination of ITL.<br\/> Test the hypothesis that service-learning lessens the digital divide.<br\/><br\/>The proposed methodology uses experimental and control groups representing varying<br\/>degrees of urbanization. A service-learning ITL class and fieldwork laboratory will establish links between undergraduates and the experimental groups. Researchers, students, and the serviced communities will develop and refine taxonomy of ITL skills. Experimental groups will be exposed to the service-learning treatment. Structured citizen surveys and focus groups will be used to analyze the data on program impact. Statistical analysis of covariance at specific points and variance over time will be employed to lay the groundwork for a predictive causal model. Several additional outcomes are expected as a result of this research. First, the study will model a new pedagogical intervention that links research, education, and community involvement in an effort to lessen the digital divide. Second, it makes the recipients of service the focus of scholarship. Most studies in this area focus on outcomes for the students rather than the recipients. Third, it focuses attention on the important distinction between IT access and IT literacy. Fourth, it promotes interdisciplinary research and training, as well as collaboration between public and private institutions seeking to incorporate IT into the campus curricula. Finally, it promotes innovation in the political science and education disciplines with the potential for a far-reaching impact on the basic definition of citizenship.","title":"ITR\/PE:Digital Citizenship: Expanding Information Technology Literacy with a Service-Learning Approach","awardID":"0503997","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2005-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1706","name":"DIGITAL GOVERNMENT"}}],"PIcoPI":["491832"],"PO":["371077"]},"104722":{"abstract":"Proposal Number: 0430594, 0429689, 0430076, 0430595<br\/><br\/>TITLE: Collaborative Research: High-Fidelity Methods for Security Protocols <br\/><br\/>PI: John Mitchell, Andre Scedrov, Vitaly Shmatikov, Daniele Micciancio<br\/><br\/>The design and security analysis of protocols that use cryptographic primitives is one of the most fundamental and challenging areas of computer security research. This project focuses on three topics: foundations of protocol analysis, automated tools, and application of tools and methods to selected protocols. Foundational work centers on relating and combining two previously separate approaches: logical methods based on symbolic execution of protocols, and computational methods involving probability and polynomial-time. The symbolic approach uses a highly idealized representation of cryptographic primitives and has been a successful basis for automated tools. Conversely, the computational approach yields more insight into the strength and vulnerabilities of protocols, but is difficult to apply and only accessible to a small number of true experts in the field. Building on past success using several automated tools, the project will devise tool-based methods that leverage new scientific foundations. Three likely application areas are secure group communication and key agreement protocols, schemes for privacy-preserving computations, and wireless networking and applications. In each of these areas, there is current demand for new secure protocols from user communities, there is ongoing activity in the research and standardization communities, and the value of combining symbolic and computational analysis concepts is evident.","title":"Collaborative Research: High Fidelity Methods for Security Protocols","awardID":"0509033","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2009-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7456","name":"ITR-CYBERTRUST"}}],"PIcoPI":["519592"],"PO":["529429"]},"101587":{"abstract":"NSF Meetings for Networking of Sensor Systems <br\/><br\/>Tracy Camp<br\/>Colorado School of Mines <br\/><br\/>Proposal Number: 0451431<br\/><br\/><br\/>The proposal is about organizing a PI meeting and an informational meeting for the NeTS focus area on Networking of Sensor Systems.

This research is grounded in psycholinguistic theories of multimodal human communication. One path from multimodal behavior to language is bridged by the underlying mental imagery. This spatial imagery, for a speaker, relates not to the elements of syntax, but to the units of thought that drive the expression (vocal utterance and visible display). Gestures reveal the focal points of the accompanying utterances, and relate to the meaning of the newsworthy elements of the unfolding discourse. This is the underlying premise of the current project, in which the PI will focus on math discourse and education for blind students.<br\/><br\/>Mathematical reasoning is rich in spatial imagery that is revealed in gesture. Furthermore, gesture has the capacity to create images of the math concepts that serve as \"objects of contemplation.\" When a graphic\/illustration is available for math instruction, the discourse stream is typically situated with gestures of spatial reference into the graphic. Research with individuals who are blind suggests that they have remarkable capacity for visual imagery, memory, and conceptualization. However, students who are blind tend to lag behind sighted students in mathematics education. The PI posits that a significant impediment to math instruction for students who are blind lies in the lack of visual access to the embodiment of the instructor. He notes that we have, in such students, a population that is able to access graphical content (through tactile image technology), but is not visually aware of the embodied behavior of the interlocutor. He proposes to remedy this problem by affording blind students a sense of embodiment awareness, with the help of augmentative communication approaches that employ tactile devices to provide elements of embodiment awareness. To this end, the PI will perform a series of \"perception and action\" experiments to assess the efficacy of such devices, followed by a second series of experiments with blind and sighted students in mathematics instruction, to be captured on video, and with pre- and post- tests, to assess the quality and quantity of imagistic content both conveyed by the teacher and by the student in the course of the instruction, and to determine the correlation, if any, between these and the formation of math conceptualization. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This project should have significant direct impact on inclusive mathematics instruction at all grade levels for visually impaired students; provision of a sense of embodiment awareness to students who are blind has not hitherto been studied, and has the potential for empowering such students. Furthermore, understanding the channels for embodiment awareness will affect the design of future distance learning systems, and will afford insights on how best to provide embodiment cues to students in Internet-based instruction.","title":"Embodiment Awareness, Mathematics Discourse, and the Blind","awardID":"0451843","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2010-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7319","name":"HSD - DYNAMICS OF HUMAN BEHAVI"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0706","name":"Division of DESIGN & MANUFACTURING INNOV","abbr":"DMI"},"pgm":{"id":"1786","name":"MANFG ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1106","name":"Division of HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT","abbr":"HRD"},"pgm":{"id":"1545","name":"RES IN DISABILITIES ED"}}],"PIcoPI":["486496","291145","351751",267991,267992],"PO":["565227"]},"100356":{"abstract":"This project entails research and development and to address the software and tools problems fro ultra-scale parallel machines, especially targeted for scalable I\/O, storage and memory hierarchy.

Increasingly, persons with disabilities are turning to Linux and other open source environments to prototype and develop consumer driven solutions to common, and not so common, computing challenges, industry and business are adopting open environments for various computing tasks, and technology providers are developing solutions to serve these growing needs through packaged distributions and technical service plans. Clearly, comprehensive accessibility support cannot be achieved without a comprehensive agreement among affected stakeholder groups. Yet, the diverse nature of the technology that constitutes today's open platforms also makes it difficult to achieve a comprehensive and cohesive layer of accessibility support; the heterogeneous nature of toolkits, component inter process communication models, libraries, and applications has made the development of robust and effective assistive technologies difficult, at best. This workshop, which is the first of its kind, will be convened in early 2005 by the Accessibility Workgroup of the Free Standards Group (FSG), and hosted by The Archimedes Project at the University of Hawaii, Honolulu. The workshop will provide the most appropriate forum for finalizing proposals for industry-wide accessibility standards where FSG work has already begun, for developing a \"road map\" for additional open source technologies and standards to support comprehensive accessibility on open platforms; and for reaching broad stakeholder consensus on a common layer of accessibility support that can be deployed and maintained on multiple platforms and can serve as the basis for future collaborative research to provide multiple, cost effective, interoperable, heterogeneous and accessible products. The workshop organizing committee consists of leaders from industry and academia with widely recognized expertise in assistive technology. The organizers will make a concerted effort to ensure broad participation, by personally inviting appropriate representatives of stakeholder communities worldwide, and by announcing the workshop on targeted e-mail lists and on the Web. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Open computing platforms are important and meritorious environments for individual and institutional users alike, and especially for the research community. Achieving standards to support comprehensive accessibility in such environments will benefit persons with disabilities, students and researchers with disabilities, as well as those without (who must now constantly address the basics of accessibility support rather than creative and innovative approaches to more complex questions), governmental agencies and educational institutions that are now legally required to support accessibility, and developers of assistive technology who will find it easier to create more useful technologies than those available today. These benefits will be available world-wide, in developing and developed nations alike, because neither cost nor access to the technology itself will be a barrier to anyone's participation, either as an end user or as a technical contributor.","title":"Creating Comprehensive Accessibility on Open Computing Platforms","awardID":"0443748","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2005-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6846","name":"UNIVERSAL ACCESS"}}],"PIcoPI":[264489],"PO":["565227"]},"98191":{"abstract":"Detection of Self-Propagating Malicious Code<br\/><br\/>Hayder Radha, Michigan State University<br\/><br\/>Award 0430436<br\/><br\/>Abstract<br\/><br\/><br\/>Novel methods for mitigating automated malicious code intrusions (e.g., computer worms) are being investigated and developed. This includes local- and network-level intrusion detection strategies that provide effective and timely detection of malicious codes. A mathematically rigorous framework, which is based on detection theory, is being applied to the intrusion detection problem. In particular, the focus is on the general case of network-based anomaly detection (i.e., the case where deviations from normal network traffic characteristics are employed to raise an alarm). The development of Neyman-Pearson tests to track anomalous user-level\/network-level traffic patterns is being investigated. An effective test necessitates development of a mathematical model for the user- and network-level traffic that can in turn be employed to define the Neyman-Pearson null hypotheses. To this end, the performance of stochastic modeling techniques that have been proven to render effective characterization of network traffic and related random processes, such as the multifractal wavelet model and the Markov chain model, are being investigated. A contribution of this effort will be development of portable software that can provide real-time and adaptive intrusion detection. The application and performance of the proposed framework in peer-to-peer and mobile ad hoc environments is also being investigated. This work will yield effective defense and detection against automated malicious codes, which have caused profound negative impacts on the global Internet and users worldwide.","title":"Detection of Self-Propagating Malicious Code","awardID":"0430436","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2008-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7456","name":"ITR-CYBERTRUST"}}],"PIcoPI":["554511"],"PO":["521752"]},"98170":{"abstract":"Collaborative Research: Trustworthy and Resilient Location Discovery in Wireless Sensor Networks<br\/><br\/>Peng Ning, North Carolina State University<br\/>Wenliang Kevin Du, Syracuse University<br\/><br\/>Award 0430223<br\/><br\/>Abstract<br\/><br\/>Sensor networks are ideal candidates for a wide range of applications such as health monitoring and military operations.

This project focuses on three topics: foundations of protocol analysis, automated tools, and application of tools and methods to selected protocols. Foundational work centers on relating and combining two previously separate approaches: logical methods based on symbolic execution of protocols, and computational methods involving probability and polynomial-time. The symbolic approach uses a highly idealized representation of cryptographic primitives and has been a successful basis for automated tools. Conversely, the computational approach yields more insight into the strength and vulnerabilities of protocols, but is difficult to apply and only accessible to a small number of true experts in the field. Building on past success using several automated tools, the project will devise tool-based methods that leverage new scientific foundations. Three likely application areas are secure group communication and key agreement protocols, schemes for privacy-preserving computations, and wireless networking and applications. In each of these areas, there is current demand for new secure protocols from user communities, there is ongoing activity in the research and standardization communities, and the value of combining symbolic and computational analysis concepts is evident.","title":"Collaborative Research: High Fidelity Methods for Security Protocols","awardID":"0429689","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2009-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7456","name":"ITR-CYBERTRUST"}}],"PIcoPI":["381704"],"PO":["529429"]},"98040":{"abstract":"To deter any future terrorist attacks, law enforcement and intelligence agencies are making every effort to enhance national security.

However, we find ourselves lacking techniques to both identifying a criminal's identity effectively and to recognizing relationships among criminals promptly. The motivation of this research is to address these criminal identity management challenges by developing a comprehensive framework for applying data mining, deception detection, and social network analysis to help identify criminal identities and relationships among criminals.

It dramatically improves the ability to perform multi-spectral and temporal studies by allowing researchers to access many databases with a single query. In its current form, increasing the number of sites and users in the WWT leads inevitably to a network crisis. As data-intensive scientific applications increase in scale, bandwidth constrains the performance of all applications sharing a network. As more scientists and educators adopt and rely on the WWT, the increased bandwidth requirements will degrade the performance of all <br\/>applications. Federations need to focus on being good \"network citizens,\" using shared resources conscientiously. If not, the workloads generated by these applications will make them unwelcome on public networks.<br\/><br\/>To avert the network crisis, this project will develop and release an open-source, commodity caching appliance based on two crucial technologies: bypass-yield caching and self-organizing database storage. Bypass-yield caching is an altruistic caching framework for scientific database workloads that balances parallelism in federations against the benefits of caching. It adopts <br\/>\"network citizenship\" as its principal goal -- caching in order to minimize network traffic. Database caching introduces an acute storage management problem for which traditional administration is inappropriate. The dynamic creation and destruction of tables in a cache requires automated, incremental storage management with low space overhead. Self-organizing database storage<br\/>automates storage management and database organization, turning the cache into an administration-free appliance.<br\/><br\/>Caching appliances are an enabling technology, making it possible for the WWT <br\/>to accept a large number of users without impeding the performance of shared <br\/>networks. Open-source software and commodity hardware make the acquisition of the appliance inexpensive and the self-organization of the cache makes it maintenance-free. The caching appliance will enhance astrophysical and astronomy research, making it possible for scientists to conduct experiments and find correlations across heterogeneous data sets at previously unforeseen <br\/>rates. The WWT and the caching gateways will also bring telescope research and education to communities of users for which it was previously unavailable, particularly undergraduates and high school students. Project plans include outreach in the form of a pilot program that will install and maintain WWT gateways at high schools, colleges, and science museums and libraries, and <br\/>assist those institutions in curriculum development.","title":"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: SEI + II (AST): Bypass-Yield Caching for Large-Scale Scientific Database Workloads in the World-Wide Telescope","awardID":"0431008","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2008-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7294","name":"SCIENCE & ENGINEERING INFORMAT"}}],"PIcoPI":["342331"],"PO":["563727"]},"99262":{"abstract":"The purpose of this workshop is to address concerns regarding security in mobile and wireless networks.

This work involves designing a novel distributed routing Intrusion Detection System (Router IDS) for performing real-time routing anomaly detection and mitigation. The Router IDS detects routing anomalies by combining publicly available routing data from multiple vantage points to check consistency and identify deviations from past routing behavior.

In response to detected routing anomalies, routing policies are modified or the suspicious routing updates are filtered. Overlay routing can also be used to bypass the router using the incorrect route.<br\/>This project is building a prototype to test the effectiveness of the detection and mitigation algorithms.

This project is investigating and developing methods for the recovery of 3D underground structures from subsurface non-invasive measurements obtained with ground penetrating radar, magnetometry, and conductivity sensors. The results will not only provide hints for further excavation but also 3D models that can be studied as if they were already excavated. The three fundamental challenges investigated are the inverse problem of recovering the volumetric material distribution, the segmentation of the underground volumes, and the reconstruction of the surfaces that comprise interesting structures. In the recovery of the underground volume, high-fidelity geophysics models are introduced in their original partial differential equation form. Partial differential equations from multiple modalities are simultaneously solved to yield a material distribution volume. In segmentation, a graph spectral method for estimating graph cuts finds clusters of underground voxels with tight connections within partitions and loose connections between partitions. A method based on multi-scale graph cuts significantly accelerates the process while the grouping properties of the normalized cuts help in clustering together multiple fragments of the same material. In surface reconstruction, boundaries obtained from segmentation or from targeted material search are converted from unorganized voxel clouds to connected surfaces. A bottom-up approach is introduced that groups neighborhoods into facets whose amount of overlap guides the triangulation process.

Nevertheless, few computer security technologies, if any, adequately utilize models of experience and context in defending against misuse. This research explores the thesis that many computer defenses can be dramatically improved, in both efficacy and usability, by modeling experience and context in a way that allows the models to become an integral element for defending the system. The interactions that can be modeled and potentially exploited are ubiquitous---they exist among persons (e.g., different user roles in access control), among computers and networks (e.g., what computers and networks typically correspond with what others), and even among attacks (e.g., what attacks realize the preconditions of others). Developing security technologies that better utilize such interactions forms the core of the research agenda in \"security through interaction modeling\" (STIM). This effort promises advances in diverse areas of security technology, such as attack traffic filtering, more usable authorization systems, and intrusion detection and response.

Rowe<br\/><br\/>ABSTRACT<br\/><br\/>This research focuses on building testable computational models of deception including the major sub-phenomena of trust, expectation, suspicion, surprise, deception plans, and manufactured patterns. Such models and an associated theory can be used to explain both offensive deceptions (to gain some advantage) and defensive deceptions (to foil someone else's plans). Using these models, the research will develop deceptive software as a second line of defense for computer systems systems under attack when access controls have been breached. Deception can mislead attackers as to the state of an information system with false error messages, deliberate delays in executing commands, lies about task completion, fake displays, disinformation about computer resources, and coordinated fake clues. Producing a convincing deception requires careful planning because people can often recognize suspicious patterns. So this research will develop plans to apply deception sparingly and thoughtfully based on a theory of trust and its psychological consequences. This will include ideas such as counterplanning against plans and a general theory of the effectiveness of excuses. Other issues to be addressed include the penalty of deceiving nonmalicious users and the ethical concerns raised by deliberate deception.","title":"Defense from Cyber-Attack Using Deception","awardID":"0429411","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2007-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"V474","name":"NSA-NEWLY EMERGING COMM SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"V979","name":"NSA-R4 TECH OPPORTUNITIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7456","name":"ITR-CYBERTRUST"}}],"PIcoPI":["549825"],"PO":["497499"]},"98187":{"abstract":"With rapid advancements in computer and network technology, it has become possible for an organization to collect, store, and retrieve vast amounts of data of all kinds quickly and efficiently. Data is of strategic and operational importance to many organizations. At the same time, these large information systems represent a potential threat to individual privacy since they contain a great amount of detailed information about individuals. Privacy of individual data handled poorly not only violates the fundamental rights of individuals and relevant federal and state laws, it is also a liability to businesses in terms of their trustworthiness and eventually their bottom line. Therefore, there is an urgent need of technology that can be adopted by organizations and businesses to protect the privacy of individuals without impeding the flow of information that is necessary to achieve their strategic and operation goals. Although this urgent need is reflected in the recent increase of research activities in the privacy area, there are several problems, especially related to a privacy-aware data release system, that are yet to be addressed. The essential questions include: when a piece of data is released, to what extent privacy of individuals is lost? If the loss is excessive, how do we modify the data to be released in a way that permits maximum flow of information while preserving privacy at the same time? <br\/><br\/>The starting point of this project is the realization that privacy concerns take different forms for different data sets. In order to preserve the privacy of individuals, the privacy concerns must be formalized. When data is released, whether used in privacy-preserving data mining or simply published to the third party or the general public, these privacy rules need to be satisfied. This is termed privacy-aware information release control. Two general approaches are adopted: query anonymization and online data checking. Query anonymization means that all queries are to be evaluated to see how much privacy is disclosed through the query. If the query discloses too much, some changes will be made so that the privacy level will be maintained. Here, the technical challenge is how to ensure that the system will release the maximum information but without any privacy violation. Online data checking means that when data is released, privacy rules will be checked on the to-be-released data to find any privacy violation. The technical challenge of online checking is its efficiency. These two methods are complementary to each other and can sometimes be used together in a practical system. The above techniques are based on knowing the privacy level that the data requester is allowed to have. Once data is released, depending on the level of private data contained in the output, some obligations may be attached. This project also tackles the problems related to management of such obligations.","title":"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Privacy-aware Information Release Control","awardID":"0430402","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2009-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"H343","name":"NIST"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"T397","name":"NIST-SNS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"T855","name":"NIST- SNS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7456","name":"ITR-CYBERTRUST"}}],"PIcoPI":["540637","339912"],"PO":["469867"]},"98099":{"abstract":"Abstract: Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) promotes new mechanisms and<br\/>methods to improve separation of concerns in software design.

While research on the behavioral aspects of online consumer behavior focusing on trust, satisfaction, and loyalty, with the aim of creating a compelling online environment to satisfy consumer needs, is increasing, the majority of these research efforts do not focus on the needs of visually impaired people, and their perception, perceived risk, and trust in Web-based environments. In this project, the PI will seek to identify the antecedents of trust from the viewpoint of the visually impaired consumer (both online users and non-users). The study will specifically seek to: identify the salient factors important in developing visually impaired consumer trust in online businesses; identify the interpersonal trust factors and the corresponding levels of interpersonal trust critical to the adaptation or continued use of the Internet by visually impaired consumers; explore variations in trust antecedents based on the demographic characteristics (age, gender, and ethnic and cultural background) of visually impaired consumers; develop a trust typology model for visually impaired consumers; and develop educational programs to aid non-users and users with increasing trust online. An understanding of visually impaired consumer perspectives on trust will enhance knowledge of the underlying principles of trust in e-commerce and move the discipline closer towards developing a centralized control for trust. Detailed knowledge of the hopes and concerns of visually impaired consumers broken down by age groups, gender, and ethnic backgrounds is critical for policy makers in charting effective Internet transaction-related policies. The findings from this study should also be of importance for online organizations in the development of proactive strategies for visually impaired customer recruitment and retention in online transactions.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Trust and commitment variables are critical for maintaining a long-term relationship between (visually impaired) consumers and online businesses.

To date, sign language recognition has focused primarily on detecting individual signs (words), articulated primarily with the arms and hands. This is a major limitation, given that critical linguistic information-including grammatical features such as negation, agreement, and question status-is conveyed through \"non-manual\" linguistic markings. These non-manual markings include facial expressions (such as raised or lowered eyebrows, varying gaze and aperture of the eyes, wrinkling of the nose, and mouth movements) and gestures or periodic movements of the head (such as tilts, nods, and shakes). No system for sign language recognition or generation can succeed without properly modeling the linguistic information produced both manually and non-manually.<br\/><br\/>The fact that these critical non-manual behaviors occur in parallel with manual signing, and that they are temporally aligned with phrases rather than with individual signs, greatly complicates the task. Further problems arise because of the difficulties of tracking the minute details of human facial movements from video, and the variations in the specific realizations (style) of manual signs and non-manual linguistic markings across different individuals, just as there is variation in the specific ways in which individuals produce a given spoken language. A comprehensive approach to ASL recognition thus requires the integration of information from multiple data sources with different spatial and temporal scales, the application of linguistic knowledge about both the manual and the non-manual aspects of ASL, and the modeling of interdependencies of activities in the manual and non-manual channels.<br\/><br\/>This collaborative project brings together the expertise of researchers in the fields of computer vision, linguistics, and recognition to achieve its goals. On the computer vision side, the principal investigators (PIs) will investigate the use of local free-form deformations and novel registration methods to enhance our existing face tracking software, so as to capture the minute details of the facial movements, and to improve robustness of the tracking. The tracking process results in a large number of facial parameters, which the researchers propose to reduce through nonlinear subspace manifold embedding. This embedding reduces the dimensionality of the parameter space, and more importantly, also results in a separation of style and content. Whereas style is specific to each signer, content captures the commonalities across all signers. Hence, by focusing on the content component, the PIs expect to be able to overcome the variations across signers and perform signer-independent recognition.<br\/><br\/>On the recognition side, the researhcers will combine the linguistic knowledge about facial microactions with computational clustering approaches to develop the necessary statistical models for recognition. Initially, these will be based on Hidden Markov Models from previous work by this research group and elsewhere; however, their power to describe the dynamical aspects of human movements is limited. To overcome these limitations, the PIs will research the use of Switching Linear Dynamic Systems, augmented by Coupled Dynamic Bayesian Networks to model and capture the interactions of the simultaneously occurring microactions. Linguists and computer scientists will collaborate in exploring the best ways to leverage information about the linguistic organization of ASL for improvement of recognition strategies.<br\/><br\/>This research will be performed on the existing linguistically annotated corpus of the National Center for Sign Language and Gesture Resources, as well as new data to be collected from 5-8 native ASL signers, which will also be annotated over the course of the project. The annotations will be used for the linguistic modeling; they also provide the \"ground truth\" for performing and validating the computer vision and recognition research.<br\/><br\/>Broader impact: <br\/>The computer-based techniques for ASL can be extended to more general systems for sign language recognition and generation, as well as for interpretation of other types of human movements, such as face gesture recognition for HCI, surveillance, verification of identity, interrogation, interviews and medical diagnosis applications. The materials to be distributed will benefit researchers in linguistics, computer science, and other domains.

retrieve vast amounts of data of all kinds quickly and efficiently. Data is of strategic and operational importance to many organizations. At the same time, these large information systems represent a potential threat to individual privacy since they contain a great amount of detailed information about individuals. Privacy of individual data handled poorly not only violates the fundamental rights of individuals and relevant federal and state laws, it is also a liability to businesses in terms of their trustworthiness and eventually their bottom line. Therefore, there is an urgent need of technology that can be adopted by organizations and businesses to protect the privacy of individuals without impeding the flow of information that is necessary to achieve their strategic and operation goals. Although this urgent need is reflected in the recent increase of research activities in the privacy area, there are several problems, especially related to a privacy-aware data release system, that are yet to be addressed. The essential questions include: when a piece of data is released, to what extent privacy of individuals is lost? If the loss is excessive, how do we modify the data to be released in a way that permits maximum flow of information while preserving privacy at the same time? <br\/><br\/>The starting point of this project is the realization that privacy concerns take different forms for different data sets. In order to preserve the privacy of individuals, the privacy concerns must be formalized. When data is released, whether used in privacy-preserving data mining or simply published to the third party or the general public, these privacy rules need to be satisfied. This is termed privacy-aware information release control. Two general approaches are adopted: query anonymization and online data checking. Query anonymization means that all queries are to be evaluated to see how much privacy is disclosed through the query. If the query discloses too much, some changes will be made so that the privacy level will be maintained. Here, the technical challenge is how to ensure that the system will release the maximum information but without any privacy violation. Online data checking means that when data is released, privacy rules will be checked on the to-be-released data to find any privacy violation. The technical challenge of online checking is its efficiency. These two methods are complementary to each other and can sometimes be used together in a practical system. The above techniques are based on knowing the privacy level that the data requester is allowed to have. Once data is released, depending on the level of private data contained in the output, some obligations may be attached. This project also tackles the problems related to management of such obligations.","title":"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Privacy-Aware Information Release Control","awardID":"0430165","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2008-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7456","name":"ITR-CYBERTRUST"}}],"PIcoPI":["427499"],"PO":["371077"]},"98178":{"abstract":"Proposal 0430304<br\/><br\/>David Wetherall, University of Washington<br\/><br\/>Abstract<br\/><br\/>Over the past several years, Internet denial-of-service (DoS) flooding attacks have become more frequent, larger, and more sophisticated. The root cause of these attacks is that the existing Internet architecture allows any party to send packets to any destination at any time, regardless of the wishes of that destination. To address this problem, the investigators are experimenting with a new architecture in which destinations have control over the network resources used to reach them. Capabilities, represented by tokens carried on packets, are the mechanism that is used to affect this control. The architecture provides two key benefits. First, it aims to provide a long-term solution to the problem of DoS, rather than a further step in an arms race with attackers. Second, it controls DoS while preserving the traditional openness of the Internet architecture, lessening the need for firewalls and intrusion detection systems that hinder the growth of new kinds of applications. A prototype of the architecture is being built for trial deployment on the Internet.","title":"Cyber Trust: Controlling Internet Denial-of-Service with Capabilities","awardID":"0430304","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2008-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7456","name":"ITR-CYBERTRUST"}}],"PIcoPI":["543394","463055"],"PO":["521752"]},"98079":{"abstract":"Many environmental observations are collected at different space and time scales that preclude easy integration of the data and hinder broader understanding of ecosystem dynamics. Ocean Observing Systems provide a specific example of multi-sensor systems observing several variables in different space - time regimes. This project integrates diverse space-time environmental sensor streams based on the conversion of their information content to a common higher-level abstraction: a space-time event data type. The space-time event data type normalizes across the diversity of observation level data to produce a common data type for exploration and analysis. Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System (GOMOOS) data provide the multivariate time and space-time series from which space-time events are detected and assembled. Event detection employs a combined top down-bottom up approach. The top down component specifies an event ontology while the bottom up component is based on extraction of primitive events (e.g. decreasing, increasing, local maxima and minima sequences) from time and space-time series. Exploration and analysis of the extracted events employs a graphic exploratory environment based on a graphic primitive called an event band and its composition into event band stacks and panels that support investigation of various space-time patterns.<br\/><br\/>The project contributes a new information integration approach based on the concept of an event that can be extended to many domains including socio-economic, financial, legislative, surveillance and health related information.

In its current form, increasing the number of sites and users in the WWT leads inevitably to a network crisis. As data-intensive scientific applications increase in scale, bandwidth constrains the performance of all applications sharing a network. As more scientists and educators adopt and rely on the WWT, the increased bandwidth requirements will degrade the performance of all <br\/>applications. Federations need to focus on being good \"network citizens,\" using shared resources conscientiously. If not, the workloads generated by these applications will make them unwelcome on public networks.<br\/><br\/>To avert the network crisis, this project will develop and release an open-source, commodity caching appliance based on two crucial technologies: bypass-yield caching and self-organizing database storage. Bypass-yield caching is an altruistic caching framework for scientific database workloads that balances parallelism in federations against the benefits of caching. It adopts <br\/>\"network citizenship\" as its principal goal -- caching in order to minimize network traffic. Database caching introduces an acute storage management problem for which traditional administration is inappropriate. The dynamic creation and destruction of tables in a cache requires automated, incremental storage management with low space overhead.

Open-source software and commodity hardware make the acquisition of the appliance inexpensive and the self-organization of the cache makes it maintenance-free. The caching appliance will enhance astrophysical and astronomy research, making it possible for scientists to conduct experiments and find correlations across heterogeneous data sets at previously unforeseen <br\/>rates. The WWT and the caching gateways will also bring telescope research and education to communities of users for which it was previously unavailable, particularly undergraduates and high school students. Project plans include outreach in the form of a pilot program that will install and maintain WWT gateways at high schools, colleges, and science museums and libraries, and <br\/>assist those institutions in curriculum development.","title":"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: SEI + II (AST): Bypass-Yield Caching for Large-Scale Scientific Database Workloads in the World-Wide Telescope","awardID":"0430848","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2008-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7294","name":"SCIENCE & ENGINEERING INFORMAT"}}],"PIcoPI":["538210","551737"],"PO":["563727"]},"98179":{"abstract":"Recent virus and worm attacks that spread through \"holes\" in popular consumer software emphasize the role the online public must play in preserving the safety and integrity of the Internet.

This project develops an integrated Sensor Flock to enable rapid characterization of toxic plumes for contamination prediction and source location. A Sensor Flock consists of semi-autonomous micro air vehicles (MAVs) transporting miniature toxin sensors throughout the atmosphere above populated areas, networked to a base station providing toxin dispersion modeling and flock supervision, using novel lightweight, real-time, data-reactive wireless information routing. MAV platforms lower manufacturing costs, reduce risks of collision damage, and reduce visibility and noise that might create public alarm.<br\/> <br\/>The concept of Information Energy is introduced to tightly integrate advances in three interdisciplinary areas: aerodynamics, networking, and control. This enables high-quality information products from the Sensor Flock, using relatively simple individual vehicles. The MAVs are designed based on biomimetic principles of bat flight to enable exceptional flight performance. Vehicle control is based on a hierarchical information energy formulation, producing simple gradient-descent guidance laws on each vehicle, but with well-understood flock clustering behavior toward regions of high-quality data. The behavior of data-driven routing in each of the following three communication scenarios is investigated: inter-MAV exchange of high-quality data for flock convergence; MAV-to-ground collection of sensor data; and ground-to-MAV command and control.<br\/> <br\/>Existing disciplinary courses at CU Boulder are enriched with results from this work, expanding student multidisciplinary exposure. A summer Aerobotics program enables local high school students to participate in a design\/build\/fly competition integrating computer science and aerospace engineering.","title":"ITR - (NHS+ASE+ECS) - (dmc+sim+int): Loosely Cooperating Micro Air Vehicle Networks for Toxic Plume Characterization","awardID":"0427947","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2009-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7314","name":"ITR FOR NATIONAL PRIORITIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["507816","500157","556808"],"PO":["565090"]},"98972":{"abstract":"NeTS - ProWiN: A Programmable Wireless Platform For Spectral, Temporal and Spatial Spectrum Management<br\/>Award 0435452<br\/>Dirk Grunwald, University of Colorado at Boulder<br\/><br\/>This project is producing a robust, affordable and highly mutable platform for experimenting with each of the core technologies that can improve spectral efficiency.

While there has been a considerable amount of scholarship on the impact of the Internet on government, governance, and society, there has been little systematic research on how Members of Congress use or should use the Internet to provide information to and interact with their constituents. <br\/><br\/>This research has both a qualitative and a quantitative component, where each of these components complement and inform the other. In the statistical component, longitudinal data to will be collected to explain the diffusion patterns of web-based technologies among the congressional offices. All congressional websites will be assessed along such dimensions as their informational value, accessibility, usability, and interactivity. Data will be collected on factors that might plausibly affect adoption ecisions.e.g., regarding the characteristics of districts, Members, the mechanisms for information spread in Congress, and so on. <br\/><br\/>The qualitative component will entail fieldwork in approximately 12 offices, stratified by the degree of web <br\/>technology adoption, as well as by political party and tenure. This in-depth field will allow study of the dynamic micro-processes that underlie and ultimately explain the aggregate patterns of technology diffusion, and will allow exploration of the internal practices and the relative efficiency of how congressional offices manage digitally-mediated information and feedback from constituents. <br\/><br\/>An important partner in the work will be the Congressional Management Foundation, which will provide unique access to data and individuals.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit of the project has several dimensions. The research combines rigorous quantitative and qualitative research to address novel questions regarding the practice of digital government in legislative settings. The research will contribute directly to the political science research on congressional behavior and institutions, and in particular to an emerging literature on entrepreneurial behavior among legislators in the U.S. House of Representatives. The research also will contribute to political scientists' and sociologists' research on the processes for the diffusion of innovations, and would be the first study of the role social networks play within the U.S. Congress in the timing of adoption of new forms of governance and new institutions for legislative representation. <br\/> <br\/> The research team includes political science and information technology research faculty at four major research universities, who are linked through the National Center for Digital Governance (NCDG) <br\/>at Harvard University. The research will produce a series of conference papers, academic journal articles, <br\/>and an academic press book on democracy in the digital age. In addition, the Congressional Management Foundation and the U.S. Congress itself will help to ensure that the knowledge that emerges through this research will help to transform the adoption and use of digital technology in Congress through a series of best practice reports, debriefing sessions, and annual conferences.","title":"Collaborative Research: Connecting to Congress: The Adoption and Use of Web Technologies Among Congressional Offices","awardID":"0429452","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2010-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1706","name":"DIGITAL GOVERNMENT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6850","name":"DIGITAL SOCIETY&TECHNOLOGIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6857","name":"DIGITAL LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7294","name":"SCIENCE & ENGINEERING INFORMAT"}}],"PIcoPI":["564159"],"PO":["427499"]},"97741":{"abstract":"Abstract<br\/>0427071<br\/>Title: Improving the Safety and Efficiency of Medical Processes<br\/>PI: Lori A.

Working with experts on medical safety and building upon past accomplishments in process languages and software verification, this project will develop visual process representations for critical paths of care that capture the morass of exceptional situations and the inherent multi-tasking undertaken by extremely busy medical professionals. Appropriate representations will be developed to guide medical professionals as well as provide the basis for analysis and evaluation leading to safety and efficiency improvements. <br\/><br\/>This approach will be evaluated using a number of medical processes. The evaluation will first involve static analysis approaches that will look for potential problems and inefficiencies. The resulting improved processes will then be used to drive a simulation environment involving actual medical personnel in role-playing situations. <br\/><br\/>The results of this research should help reduce healthcare costs, improve medical outcomes, and support the training of medical personnel. Moreover, the process definitions and analysis capabilities that arise from the proposed work should be applicable for reducing errors and improving efficiency in a wide variety of human-computer application areas.","title":"ITR-(EVS+ASE+NHS)-(int+dmc+soc)-Improving the Safety and Efficiency of Medical Processes","awardID":"0427071","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2009-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7314","name":"ITR FOR NATIONAL PRIORITIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["536735","524459","536736","536737"],"PO":["564388"]},"97983":{"abstract":"This small planning grant will examine the topic of animal disease intentionally introduced for purposes of terror and economic disaster.

One of the major contributing factors of the problem is the resistance of healthcare professionals towards the adoption and integrated use of information systems and information management technologies, such as (CPOE) computerized physician order entry systems, (EMR) electronic medical record systems, electronic prescription (e-prescribing) technology systems, Pocket PCs, Tablet PCs, and Personal Digital Pens. Such information technologies could help to significantly decrease medical errors and reduce costs while improving the quality of healthcare delivery. The integration of clinical processes and information technology (IT) is imperative in improving healthcare quality in America. The benefits of adopting information technology to improve patient care would seem to be obvious, and yet many healthcare professionals remain remarkably resistant. Previous research suggests that technology adoption models that work well in business environments do not explain the technology adoption process and the resistance to technology adoption in the healthcare industry. Certain healthcare specialties (in particular physicians and radiologists) are more resistant to information technology adoption for clinical purposes than others despite the potential economic and quality of care benefits and despite the fact that they may readily use information technology for personal reasons. Approaching the problem from two new perspectives (social networks and persuasion and social influence) and combining a small in-depth case study with a larger survey in multiple locations will provide new insights into this paradox.<br\/><br\/>Researchers will be working with both healthcare and IT professionals to develop practical guidelines for the development and implementation of integrated medical information systems delivered with new information technology in clinical environments. The researchers will devise a set of interventions and guidelines for IT deployment designed to improve healthcare professionals' participation and ultimately the quality of care provided. These guidelines will be integrated into a set of Best Practices that will be shared with hospitals to help improve healthcare professionals' participation, with developers of healthcare information technology systems and with the individuals who would be responsible for the implementation and evaluation of such systems.","title":"ITR-(ECS)-(soc + int): Overcoming Barriers to Integrated Information System and Information Technology Adoption by Health Care Professionals: Diagnosis, Prescription and Prognosis","awardID":"0426593","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2008-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7314","name":"ITR FOR NATIONAL PRIORITIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":[257044,257045,257046,257047,257048],"PO":["565136"]},"95288":{"abstract":"The state of practice in human-computer interaction today is the graphical user interface, or direct manipulation, interaction style. This project seeks to identify and unify an emerging next generation of user interaction from a range of seemingly disconnected current research (including virtual reality, augmented reality, ubiquitous, pervasive, and handheld interaction, tangible user interfaces, lightweight, tacit, or passive interaction, perceptual interfaces, affective computing, context-aware interfaces, and speech and multi-modal interfaces). Ubiquitous computing, tangible interfaces, and the spread of computers into a wide range of products and objects are changing interacting with computers, from a specialized activity segregated from daily life, to one that is more and more a part of the real world. At the same time, as computers are becoming more a part of the real world, user interfaces seem to be evolving to behave more and more like the real world (e.g., in virtual reality). The PI believes these can be connected through his concept of \"reality-based interaction\" by focusing on the ways in which interfaces that are based on reality exploit users' built-in abilities, and that this idea will provide the necessary leverage to tie them together and define a new generation of user interfaces, in the hope that this naive notion can be built into a useful theoretical framework. Starting from the idea of natural or \"reality-based\" interfaces, which gain their strength because they exploit abilities that their users already possess, the PI will formalize the notion of learned knowledge vs. \"reality-based\" skills needed to use a system. He will develop this into a theoretical framework and flesh it out more formally, and use it to identify specific open issues for investigation. The PI will then modify or reinvent the initial approach, as needed, and will test the theory, first by applying it against a range of published results, and second by devising experiments specifically for testing, where aspects of a user interface can be selectively manipulated for the experiment. For this phase of the work, the PI will design, implement, and evaluate selected new interaction techniques representing gaps or opportunities suggested by the framework.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This project will lead to a unified theoretical framework for the next generation of human-computer interfaces, which should serve as a foundation and guide for research in the field. It will also result in prototype implementations and experimental evaluation of new interaction techniques, and will furthermore help extend research in new interaction styles beyond the relatively large and well-funded institutions that can currently pursue it, in that the PI will develop as part of the project an inexpensive workbench (or infrastructure package) to support this work, which he will then disseminate on the web (hardware descriptions and software tools) to other universities.","title":"Reality-Based Interaction: A New Framework for Understanding the Next Generation of Human-Computer Interfaces","awardID":"0414389","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2008-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1713","name":"WORKFORCE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6845","name":"HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6850","name":"DIGITAL SOCIETY&TECHNOLOGIES"}}],"PIcoPI":["519872"],"PO":["565227"]},"98313":{"abstract":"Sudden heart attacks remain the leading cause of death in the US. Heart attacks are caused by complications of \"vulnerable plaques.\" The discovery of vulnerable plaques has recently evolved into the definition of the \"vulnerable patient\" (VP).

Using Claytronics, this research investigates new forms of communication media, called \"pario\", which can be used to capture and<br\/>reproduce dynamic 3D objects.

Advanced robots have replaced human operators and manual control of screening processes to promote safe, quick and accurate assessment of chemicals and toxins. In the screening process, the role of the human operator has changed to that of supervisory controller of multiple robots manning multiple process lines and performing simultaneous experiments. The operator's task now includes monitoring robot states, detecting errors, and intervening in process control for failure mode recovery. Operators are under high workload and time stress to properly sequence experiments and to quickly make changes if they do not progress as planned. The information requirements for effective performance have expanded dramatically; task workload is now primarily cognitive vs. physical; and there is a need to achieve high levels of situation awareness in dangerous chemical operations. All of these changes have had a major affect on operator stress and work health.<br\/><br\/>In this project, the PI and his team will develop an intelligent\/adaptive, human-machine interface to support the new role of screening process supervisors in safe and effective, distributed control of high time stress and high risk, automated chemical and toxicity testing. Development of this technology will be based on cognitive modeling of supervisory controller behaviors during actual chemical screening processes and model predictions of operator performance with different interactive information display design alternatives during the (model) design phase and during chemical process run-time. The PI will prototype control interfaces and shared situation awareness displays for operators that integrate and display process output data adapted to operator concurrent performance needs and functional (physiological) states. The work will also involve creating protocols for long-distance, remote operation of automated screening processes under varying network communication conditions to provide access to \"start-up\" companies and developing nations with critical screening needs (e.g., anti-terrorism work). In addition, the intelligent interface content and the remote process control scenario will be informed by, and adapted based on, an automated robot (mechanical) \"health\" monitoring system. Outcomes of the project will include a prototype novel intelligent, adaptive interface technology as embodied in a remote process control system. Advanced computational tools will also be developed to classify operator functional states in real-time, based on physiological data, and to relate this information to screening task workload and performance. Physiological and performance data models will be used as a basis for structuring the cognitive model to promote highly accurate operator performance predictions and facilitate effective dynamic interface configuration for remote screening process control.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This research will impact and enhance the safety and effectiveness of high-throughput, chemical agent screening, thanks to a combination of new approaches to distributed network control of complex automated systems, user-centered design of adaptive\/intelligent interfaces, and support of complex system operator situation awareness and decision making through process information integration and management based on operator functional states. The work will result in increased access for new companies and developing countries to highly specialized and expensive automated, chemical screening technologies potentially accelerating the development of new biotechnologies.

There is a strong motivation to thoroughly understand the interference phenomenon and adaptively adjust a wireless network to mitigate its effect. The research objective is to codify the emission from several devices that produce electromagnetic interference in the 2.4 GHz (and potentially 5 GHz) unlicensed band.<br\/>A three-prong methodology is employed: (1) development of a theoretical model of the interfering signal in the temporal and spectral domains; (2) the validation of the interference model via computer simulation; (3) physical experimentation to verify and enhance the accuracy of the previous results, which in turn augment the experimental work.<br\/>For the devices considered, the interference temperature is determined as an outcome. The aggregate effect on wireless network throughput is measured and related to the interference temperature. These results suggest that techniques can be developed to improve network connectivity. Temporal, spatial, and spectral scales can be advantageously used in adaptive algorithms to flatten interference and assist in the development of underlay networks, such as ultrawideband.<br\/>This research will have broad impact and allow the technical community to better understand how to use the available network resources. Network performance improvement can result in significant cost saving to the wireless industry. An important impact will be on U.S. government communication policy.

To date, sign language recognition has focused primarily on detecting individual signs (words), articulated primarily with the arms and hands. This is a major limitation, given that critical linguistic information-including grammatical features such as negation, agreement, and question status-is conveyed through \"non-manual\" linguistic markings. These non-manual markings include facial expressions (such as raised or lowered eyebrows, varying gaze and aperture of the eyes, wrinkling of the nose, and mouth movements) and gestures or periodic movements of the head (such as tilts, nods, and shakes). No system for sign language recognition or generation can succeed without properly modeling the linguistic information produced both manually and non-manually.<br\/><br\/>The fact that these critical non-manual behaviors occur in parallel with manual signing, and that they are temporally aligned with phrases rather than with individual signs, greatly complicates the task. Further problems arise because of the difficulties of tracking the minute details of human facial movements from video, and the variations in the specific realizations (style) of manual signs and non-manual linguistic markings across different individuals, just as there is variation in the specific ways in which individuals produce a given spoken language. A comprehensive approach to ASL recognition thus requires the integration of information from multiple data sources with different spatial and temporal scales, the application of linguistic knowledge about both the manual and the non-manual aspects of ASL, and the modeling of interdependencies of activities in the manual and non-manual channels.<br\/><br\/>This collaborative project brings together the expertise of researchers in the fields of computer vision, linguistics, and recognition to achieve its goals. On the computer vision side, the principal investigators (PIs) will investigate the use of local free-form deformations and novel registration methods to enhance our existing face tracking software, so as to capture the minute details of the facial movements, and to improve robustness of the tracking. The tracking process results in a large number of facial parameters, which the researchers propose to reduce through nonlinear subspace manifold embedding. This embedding reduces the dimensionality of the parameter space, and more importantly, also results in a separation of style and content. Whereas style is specific to each signer, content captures the commonalities across all signers. Hence, by focusing on the content component, the PIs expect to be able to overcome the variations across signers and perform signer-independent recognition.<br\/><br\/>On the recognition side, the researhcers will combine the linguistic knowledge about facial microactions with computational clustering approaches to develop the necessary statistical models for recognition. Initially, these will be based on Hidden Markov Models from previous work by this research group and elsewhere; however, their power to describe the dynamical aspects of human movements is limited. To overcome these limitations, the PIs will research the use of Switching Linear Dynamic Systems, augmented by Coupled Dynamic Bayesian Networks to model and capture the interactions of the simultaneously occurring microactions. Linguists and computer scientists will collaborate in exploring the best ways to leverage information about the linguistic organization of ASL for improvement of recognition strategies.<br\/><br\/>This research will be performed on the existing linguistically annotated corpus of the National Center for Sign Language and Gesture Resources, as well as new data to be collected from 5-8 native ASL signers, which will also be annotated over the course of the project. The annotations will be used for the linguistic modeling; they also provide the \"ground truth\" for performing and validating the computer vision and recognition research.<br\/><br\/>Broader impact: <br\/>The computer-based techniques for ASL can be extended to more general systems for sign language recognition and generation, as well as for interpretation of other types of human movements, such as face gesture recognition for HCI, surveillance, verification of identity, interrogation, interviews and medical diagnosis applications. The materials to be distributed will benefit researchers in linguistics, computer science, and other domains.

This suite of tools will thus allow direct automated measurement of networks of face-to-face interaction over time. Having demonstrated and validated this approach, the project will illuminate a set of classic theoretical problems that have eluded rigorous analysis under conventional methods.

Cluster nodes exchange information through both TCP\/IP and high-speed network fabrics that often bypass operating system controls. As clusters become ubiquitous with Internet connection commonplace, the services they deliver will likely place them at a greater risk for attacks or intentional misuse by insiders. Mississippi State University has been pursuing research in anomaly detection within High Performance Computing (HPC) networks since 2000. This work is currently sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense. One of the major challenges for research in anomaly detection within high performance networks is the dearth of data sets for evaluating performance.

To date, sign language recognition has focused primarily on detecting individual signs (words), articulated primarily with the arms and hands. This is a major limitation, given that critical linguistic information-including grammatical features such as negation, agreement, and question status-is conveyed through \"non-manual\" linguistic markings. These non-manual markings include facial expressions (such as raised or lowered eyebrows, varying gaze and aperture of the eyes, wrinkling of the nose, and mouth movements) and gestures or periodic movements of the head (such as tilts, nods, and shakes). No system for sign language recognition or generation can succeed without properly modeling the linguistic information produced both manually and non-manually.<br\/><br\/>The fact that these critical non-manual behaviors occur in parallel with manual signing, and that they are temporally aligned with phrases rather than with individual signs, greatly complicates the task. Further problems arise because of the difficulties of tracking the minute details of human facial movements from video, and the variations in the specific realizations (style) of manual signs and non-manual linguistic markings across different individuals, just as there is variation in the specific ways in which individuals produce a given spoken language. A comprehensive approach to ASL recognition thus requires the integration of information from multiple data sources with different spatial and temporal scales, the application of linguistic knowledge about both the manual and the non-manual aspects of ASL, and the modeling of interdependencies of activities in the manual and non-manual channels.<br\/><br\/>This collaborative project brings together the expertise of researchers in the fields of computer vision, linguistics, and recognition to achieve its goals. On the computer vision side, the principal investigators (PIs) will investigate the use of local free-form deformations and novel registration methods to enhance our existing face tracking software, so as to capture the minute details of the facial movements, and to improve robustness of the tracking. The tracking process results in a large number of facial parameters, which the researchers propose to reduce through nonlinear subspace manifold embedding. This embedding reduces the dimensionality of the parameter space, and more importantly, also results in a separation of style and content. Whereas style is specific to each signer, content captures the commonalities across all signers. Hence, by focusing on the content component, the PIs expect to be able to overcome the variations across signers and perform signer-independent recognition.<br\/><br\/>On the recognition side, the researhcers will combine the linguistic knowledge about facial microactions with computational clustering approaches to develop the necessary statistical models for recognition. Initially, these will be based on Hidden Markov Models from previous work by this research group and elsewhere; however, their power to describe the dynamical aspects of human movements is limited. To overcome these limitations, the PIs will research the use of Switching Linear Dynamic Systems, augmented by Coupled Dynamic Bayesian Networks to model and capture the interactions of the simultaneously occurring microactions. Linguists and computer scientists will collaborate in exploring the best ways to leverage information about the linguistic organization of ASL for improvement of recognition strategies.<br\/><br\/>This research will be performed on the existing linguistically annotated corpus of the National Center for Sign Language and Gesture Resources, as well as new data to be collected from 5-8 native ASL signers, which will also be annotated over the course of the project. The annotations will be used for the linguistic modeling; they also provide the \"ground truth\" for performing and validating the computer vision and recognition research.<br\/><br\/>Broader impact: <br\/>The computer-based techniques for ASL can be extended to more general systems for sign language recognition and generation, as well as for interpretation of other types of human movements, such as face gesture recognition for HCI, surveillance, verification of identity, interrogation, interviews and medical diagnosis applications.

Learning research has no shortage of rigorous laboratory results and associated principles, or of realistic classroom design experiments and associated course innovations, but there is a persistent shortage of experimental results that are both rigorous and realistic. The PSLC has two key goals: (1) to establish a new paradigm of in vivo learning experimention, to produce results that survive rigorous experimentation with laboratory-quality methods in real classroom settings; and (2) to focus research on robust learning, that is, learning that is retained over long durations, transfers to novel situations, and accelerates future learning. <br\/><br\/>PSLC researchers will pursue results within this new paradigm that are guided by, but not limited to, the following research clusters:<br\/>1. Co-training. When, how, and why do students' use of multiple inputs, representations or strategies facilitate learning by providing an avenue for self-supervised learning that goes beyond learning supported by teacher and peer feedback?<br\/>2. Dialogue. When, how, and why does classroom talk and tutorial dialog, whether by human or computer, promote robust learning?<br\/>3. Refinement. How do learners determine the causal connections between cues in the environment, their actions, and desired knowledge and how can instructional support and feedback facilitate learners in making such connections?<br\/>4. Fluency. How does more isolated learning of knowledge components interact with learning within larger authentic performances and how can instruction support such interactions to yield more fluent and robust learning?<br\/><br\/>To amortize the demanding set up costs required of individual researchers who want to perform in vivo experimentation, PSLC will develop LearnLab, an international resource for learning scientists that combines classroom testbeds, advanced technology, and a vast, detailed database of learner interactions. In particular, the LearnLab testbed will include seven highly instrumented courses enhanced with intelligent tutoring systems: Algebra, Geometry, Physics, Chemistry, French, Chinese and English as a second language. These courses will host the in vivo experimentation. PSLC will develop the social and technological infrastructure necessary to facilitate such experimentation.<br\/><br\/>PSLC activities will address education and diversity goals as well as research goals. LearnLab both requires and affords pre-doctoral and post-doctoral training of learning scientists to take advantage of this new paradigm. LearnLab will also enrich the scientific infrastructure by establishing extensive collaborations among current and future psychologists, statisticians, psychometricians, computer scientists, engineers, and instructional designers. Experimental manipulations that demonstrate substantial learning gains will be incorporated in LearnLab schools that reach diverse populations and eventually to many other schools. The PSLC diversity plan includes activities that will increase the pipeline of diverse learners and learning scientists from the high school level to center leaders.","title":"SLC Center: Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center: Studying Robust Learning with Learning Experiments in Real Classrooms","awardID":"0354420","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2012-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0400","name":"Division of A\/D FUND","abbr":"A\/D"},"pgm":{"id":"7279","name":"SCIENCE OF LEARNING CTRS-OTHER"}},{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0400","name":"Division of A\/D FUND","abbr":"A\/D"},"pgm":{"id":"H395","name":"NIH"}},{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0400","name":"Division of A\/D FUND","abbr":"A\/D"},"pgm":{"id":"I352","name":"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH"}},{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0400","name":"Division of A\/D FUND","abbr":"A\/D"},"pgm":{"id":"T499","name":"NIH-NSF SCI OF LEARNING CTR"}},{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0401","name":"Division of SBE Off of Multidisciplinary A","abbr":"SMA"},"pgm":{"id":"7278","name":"SCIENCE OF LEARN CTRS- CENTERS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}}],"PIcoPI":["498182",240772,240773,"533937"],"PO":["564308"]},"92786":{"abstract":"NEES Consortium, Inc., through this cooperative agreement, will manage, operate, and maintain the national George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) infrastructure during FY 2005 - FY 2014. This infrastructure consists of (1) Consortium headquarters led by an Executive Director, (2) 15 shared use, state-of-the-art earthquake engineering experimental research sites located across the U.S., and (3) an information technology (IT)\/NEESgrid cyberinfrastructure. The equipment sites and cyberinfrastructure provide a user-friendly, collaborative, accessible, and data-rich experimental and analytical infrastructure for research, education, and technology transfer across the earthquake engineering field. The equipment sites include single (outdoor), dual, and triple shake tables; geotechnical centrifuges with in-flight biaxial shakers and robotic tools; a tsunami wave basin; large laboratories for testing structures, soil-foundation-structure interaction systems, and lifeline systems; mobile geotechnical and structural testing field equipment; and two permanently instrumented field sites in southern California. The NEESgrid cyberinfrastructure seamlessly integrates the 15 equipment sites and their telepresence capabilities, a national curated data repository, web-based collaborative tools, access to leading edge compute resources, and open-source computational tools such as OpenSees. This cyberinfrastructure will enable hybrid testing methods (coupled computational and physical simulations) as well as multi-site distributed experimentation. Technical staff at Consortium headquarters, the equipment sites, and the NEES cyberinfrastructure center will help potential and funded investigators discover and use NEES resources. The Consortium will coordinate training courses on equipment site and IT usage, visiting scholar programs, development of curricular materials, research experiences for undergraduates (REUs) and research experiences for teachers (RETs), seminars for practicing engineers, and K-12 and public outreach. The capabilities provided by the NEES infrastructure will enable researchers in the U.S., along with collaborators abroad, to address the research problems outlined in Preventing Earthquake Disasters - The Grand Challenge in Earthquake Engineering - A Research Agenda for the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) [National Research Council, National Academy Press, 2003] to advance fundamental knowledge and develop new technologies to address a compelling national need - earthquake loss reduction. Through separate awards, NSF will fund individual investigator, small group, and grand challenge projects to conduct research using the NEES infrastructure. Through the Consortium, the U.S. is well positioned to establish a strong world leadership role in earthquake engineering. This award is for five years, and will be reviewed annually, under a cooperative agreement between the National Science Foundation and NEES Consortium, Inc.

The focus of this research is on un-derstanding and guiding how the current pricing situation might change as the speed of residential broadband increases-if optimistic visions hold it might be 100 times faster in 10 years. First, current approaches to pricing, based on long term measurement and service tiers, may not be effective as the peak-to-average ratio of traffic changes. The second research issue is the \"heavy user\" problem-how to deal with the exceptional user that generates traffic loads an order of magnitude or more greater than the average users. The heavy user problem potentially worsens as the capability for high-end usage goes up by two orders of magnitude. The third issue is the \"incomplete aggregation problem\". In the core of the Internet today, much of the burstiness of traffic has been smoothed out, so providers negotiate contracts that approximate long-term av-erage traffic rates with some allowance for residual traffic bursts. As the peak to average ratio of individual flows increases, the residual burstiness in traffic ag-gregates of a given size may go up. A central question for this research is there-fore what is a rational model for the cost (and pricing) of carrying this bursty traffic. The goal of the research is to contribute to the development of the broad-band access, and to encourage the continued deployment of advanced broad-band services.","title":"NeTS-NR: Pricing, Shaping and Aggregation in Broadband Access","awardID":"0435078","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2005-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["565000"],"PO":["565090"]},"97825":{"abstract":"Proposal Number: CNS-0427700<br\/><br\/>Title: ITR - Large-Scale Network Simulation for Security and Survivability Evaluation<br\/><br\/>Principal Investigator: George F.

Therefore, each data transmission impinges upon multiple nodes, even if they are not the intended destination. The effects of this interference are felt at the physical layer as well as data link, MAC, and network layers. Cooperative communication strives to turn this liability into an asset by treating interference as an additional source of information. The information transmitted across one wireless link, due to the broadcast nature of radio, is (partially and randomly) available to other nodes beside the intended destination. This additional information, distributed throughout the network, may be exploited in a gainful manner. In other words, cooperative communication exploits the statistical variation of the link signal-to-noise ratios, together with the inherent broadcast nature of radio, to yield a more efficient communication system. This research (1) analyzes the impact of physical layer cooperation on the higher layers and (2) develops methods and algorithms to realize the benefit of cooperation in the data link layer, MAC layer, and the network layer.

In order to commercialize new technology, an organization must understand the components of the thicket. Cumulative innovation in an industry can lead to blocking patents that effectively stifle innovation. Patent pools, an organizational structure where firms can aggregate patent rights into a package for licensing, can work in these circumstances, but may face antitrust challenges. New antitrust guidelines now permit these patent pools in certain circumstances where they are seen as pro-competitive, but there is no methodology for objectively identifying and measuring thickets. <br\/><br\/>Patent pools are hypothesized to arise when patent thickets already exist. Analyzing pools might provide insight into the identification and measurement of thickets. The research utilizes network analysis and comparison of large networks in order to provide insight into circumstances in which thickets can be the basis for pro-competitive patent pools. The work is exploratory in that the patent networks are very large. The preliminary effort has involved modifying standard network density equations to correct for temporal constraints in patents, and a measure of patent network density has been developed. It will be validated and expanded. The work will contribute to the study of large networks and the resulting tool should be useful in the process of technology search.

In this proposal the term QoS may thus refer to parameters such as response time, reliability and availability of a service. <br\/>Development of a QoS assurance methodology for NGN applications is the focus of this project.

QoS provisioning is concerned with resource allocation and middleware configuration such that the QoS expectations of a service are met. QoS monitoring is concerned with measuring the actual QoS of a service as experienced by a user. Despite provisioning, users of NGN services may experience QoS degradation due to malicious attacks launched on these services by adversaries. NGN services must be able to withstand these attacks and continue to offer the same level of QoS to its users. In order to be able to withstand these attacks, they must be detected in a timely fashion so as to limit the damage caused by these attacks.

Furthermore, DCW works effectively irrespective of whether Random Early Dis-card (RED) or drop-tail queueing method is used at the point of congestion. To apply DCW to specific applications, new protocols are designed that specify how nodes generate probes, collect and process delay samples for Internet paths with no common end point, and provide the shared congestion detection out-come to the applications. The protocols include a loose synchronization tech-nique to limit any synchronization offset between probe sequences to the maxi-mum value. Protocols are designed for applications that run on overlay net-works with both tree and mesh topologies with the objective of improving the applications' performance by removing shared bottlenecks. The DCW technique is expected to enable the design of protocols that construct overlay networks with improved topologies where shared bottlenecks are removed.

Data will be collected on factors that might plausibly affect adoption ecisions.e.g., regarding the characteristics of districts, Members, the mechanisms for information spread in Congress, and so on. <br\/><br\/>The qualitative component will entail fieldwork in approximately 12 offices, stratified by the degree of web <br\/>technology adoption, as well as by political party and tenure. This in-depth field will allow study of the dynamic micro-processes that underlie and ultimately explain the aggregate patterns of technology diffusion, and will allow exploration of the internal practices and the relative efficiency of how congressional offices manage digitally-mediated information and feedback from constituents. <br\/><br\/>An important partner in the work will be the Congressional Management Foundation, which will provide unique access to data and individuals.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit of the project has several dimensions. The research combines rigorous quantitative and qualitative research to address novel questions regarding the practice of digital government in legislative settings. The research will contribute directly to the political science research on congressional behavior and institutions, and in particular to an emerging literature on entrepreneurial behavior among legislators in the U.S. House of Representatives. The research also will contribute to political scientists' and sociologists' research on the processes for the diffusion of innovations, and would be the first study of the role social networks play within the U.S. Congress in the timing of adoption of new forms of governance and new institutions for legislative representation. <br\/><br\/> The research team includes political science and information technology research faculty at four major research universities, who are linked through the National Center for Digital Governance (NCDG) <br\/>at Harvard University. The research will produce a series of conference papers, academic journal articles, <br\/>and an academic press book on democracy in the digital age. In addition, the Congressional Management Foundation and the U.S. Congress itself will help to ensure that the knowledge that emerges through this research will help to transform the adoption and use of digital technology in Congress through a series of best practice reports, debriefing sessions, and annual conferences.","title":"Collaborative Research: Connecting to Congress: The Adoption & Use of Web Technologies Among Congressional Offices","awardID":"0428006","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2010-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1706","name":"DIGITAL GOVERNMENT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6850","name":"DIGITAL SOCIETY&TECHNOLOGIES"}}],"PIcoPI":[257568],"PO":["427499"]},"98618":{"abstract":"This project will develop a hybrid method for rigorously observing structures of social interaction over time, and validate this method by comparison with conventional survey and observation designs. It will use both wearable and fixed computer devices to collect streaming data on research participants' physical location, speech, and motion, and then will develop computational models to infer structures of social interaction from these data. This suite of tools will thus allow direct automated measurement of networks of face-to-face interaction over time. Having demonstrated and validated this approach, the project will illuminate a set of classic theoretical problems that have eluded rigorous analysis under conventional methods. Substantial advances in modeling the dynamics of social networks have been frustrated by the paucity of appropriate data for empirical investigation, as scholars must often address dynamic theories using cross-sectional or sparse panel data. <br\/> <br\/>The team of investigators includes experts from both Computer Science and Sociology, integrates tools from both fields, and addresses questions that would be intractable without this interdisciplinary lens. For example, the precise measurement of interaction in time and space allows researchers to observe the co-evolution of social roles (as performed by individuals in day-to-day interaction) and structural positions in a social network. The streaming measures of social interaction allow a detailed analysis of conversations, analyzing how styles of communication change within social relationships over time, including the effect of structural position on styles of interaction and the effect of interaction style on position in the network. <br\/><br\/>The research will examine the simple evolution of social networks over short (weeks) and long (month and\/or years) time scales. Using Global Positioning Systems and various other location sensor technologies, the work will contribute an explicitly spatial investigation of network dynamics, modeling the interplay of the physical environment and social networks. For example, particular locations may serve as hubs or bridges, connecting otherwise disparate network components. Results may refine scientific understanding of the co-evolution of social networks and physical locations. <br\/> <br\/>The project will develop a set of methods for social network observation and analysis, generate datasets of unprecedented breadth and depth, and provide an independent standard for comparison of conventional tools, all of which will be invaluable resources for the broader scientific community. The resulting longitudinal network datasets are likely to be mined for insights into social network dynamics by many other researchers, while the team of graduate students working under this project will benefit from unique interdisciplinary training. Beyond basic research, the novel application of sensor-based and machine learning methods to understanding human communication has broad applicability to real-world social problems. As a simple example, a refined understanding of the co-evolution of networks and physical locations may provide insight into macro-level processes of community integration and disintegration, informing social architects and urban planners. The project will promote teaching, training and understanding among researchers in computer science and social science.","title":"Collaborative Research:Creating Dynamic Social Network Models from Sensor Data","awardID":"0433012","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2007-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7319","name":"HSD - DYNAMICS OF HUMAN BEHAVI"}}],"PIcoPI":["550806"],"PO":["565136"]},"94428":{"abstract":"Tadmor - Abstract<br\/><br\/>This research focuses on the use of feedback in unsteady fluid flow control, and on the implications born out by feedback control on tightly interconnected issues of system modeling, control & observer design, algorithm development and embedded systems implementation. The research pursues the design of distributed real-time<br\/>sensing, processing and actuation through the use of distributed reconfigurable hardware (FPGA) resources. Decentralized computation arises naturally in the context of sensor and actuator arrays, addressing parameterized spatiotemporal structures. FPGA resources enables applications to be realized in real-time<br\/>that up to know have not been possible. FPGA implementations will give a factor of ten or more speed up to the algorithms currently being used, and become a technology enabler by allowing flow control to consider new real-time algorithms and altogether new forms of computationally intensive actuation.<br\/><br\/>Effective feedback flow & combustion regulation methods are critical enablers for improving a wide range of<br\/>industrial applications that involve shear layer mixing, ranging from aircraft, automotive, semiconductor and imaging, air conditioning, the chemical process industry, furnaces and incinerators, to aeroengines & ground based gas turbines for power generation. The research conducted in this project is driven by the principal benchmark of suppressing thermoacoustic instabilities in a bluff body flame holder by using distributed sensors and actuators and embedded computations. This problem gives rise to a set of case studies of escalated complexity, used to successively isolate and remove key stumbling blocks. The project vestigates methods to make such techniques more easily applicable to future uses through the development of tools and design libraries. In conjunction with the case studies, the research is developing a generic toolbox for (hybrid) models, design algorithms and embedded systems implementations in feedback flow and combustion control.","title":"EHS:Embedded Systems for Feedback Control in Fluid Flow Applications","awardID":"0410246","effectiveDate":"2004-10-15","expirationDate":"2008-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2801","name":"EMBEDDED & HYBRID SYSTEMS(EHS)"}}],"PIcoPI":["557274","284682"],"PO":["561889"]},"97948":{"abstract":"A goal of virtual reality is the simulation of the physical world and convincing displays of the simulation. Although progress has been made in developing visual, auditory, and haptic displays, virtual environments are still generally unconvincing. One hypothesis is that a totality of sensory effects is necessary to create a realistic sense of immersion, including atmospheric effects such as wind, smell, and radiance, yet there has been little systematic research on incorporating such effects. In this project, the PI and his team will create the Treadport Active Wind Tunnel (TPAWT), a 3D wind display enhancement for the Treadport locomotion interface, which comprises a large tilting treadmill, a CAVE-like visual display, and an active mechanical tether attached to the torso. Taking into account geometrical constraints such as the presence of frontal screens, a system of controlled directional vents will be placed around a user. Air will be discharged from the vents using a dedicated programmable air-handling unit. Flows will be precisely mixed, based on model reduction techniques, and controlled to produce a sensation of wind from any direction and up to speeds of 20 mph. Nonlinear feedback controllers will be devised to sense and regulate airflow near a user. Odors and chemicals will be displayed to users by injection into the airflow system, while infrared lamps arrayed in the ceiling will generate radiant heat. The PI expects the integration of 3D wind and olfactory capabilities into the existing Treadport system to reinforce the graphical, auditory and locomotion effects will result in a new degree of realism in the immersive virtual reality interface. To test out and fine-tune the system, wind generation will be incorporated into an urban virtual environment, which includes pedestrians and cars generating noises and smells. The simulation of the magnitude and direction of the wind, as well as the dispersion of odors or air-borne chemicals, will be based on the QUIC (Quick Urban & Industrial Complex) dispersion modeling system, which provides fast simulation of the flow field around buildings and the concentration fields of chemical plumes. One experimental application will relate to developing methods for tracing the source of noxious chemicals released into the environment. With a real-time wind and plume dispersion simulation, response and training scenarios can be developed. Small mobile robots with chemical sensors can be placed on the treadmill to track plumes using algorithms that take into account wind direction, wind speed and local concentrations.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts. The generation of 3D airflow is a new research topic, which will allow realistic wind and olfactory displays for virtual environments, and offer an alternative to traditional wind tunnels by placing airflow at a local region of interest without immersing a whole structure, and by simulating meandering wind. By simulating plume dispersion of chemicals around city structures, training and emergency response scenarios can be developed for the release of chemical agents into the atmosphere. The research adds fluid mechanics and control to the already highly interdisciplinary Treadport project that also includes psychology, biomechanics, robotics, and computer graphics, and will result in the training of a sizable number of graduate students competent to conduct interdisciplinary research.","title":"ITR: (ASE+NHS+ECS)-(int+dmc+sim): Generation of Complex Environmental Flow Patterns for Virtual Environments","awardID":"0428856","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2010-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6845","name":"HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7314","name":"ITR FOR NATIONAL PRIORITIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7496","name":"COLLABORATIVE SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["513354",257885,"508539","494681","508369"],"PO":["565227"]},"95539":{"abstract":"In the past decade, we have seen a dramatic increase in the availability of<br\/>on-line academic lecture material.

The meta-object model combines the affinity (desire-to-know) and privilege\/obligation (need-to-know) information into a unified information model which facilitates efficient information access and secure access control. The Adlets and Malleable objects in this meta model are active objects that capture inter-dependency among object accesses. This information model is to be used to develop a new methodology for flexible and dynamic workflow system design. Traditional workflow systems are either process- or product-based. Different from these existing systems, workflows in the proposed information-based system models all workflows as activities of information accesses. As a result, it allows for incomplete specification of the initial workflow and dynamic construction of the workflow, i.e., exception and special sub-workflows are generated as needed when information accesses are invoked. There are two significant technical impacts in the research: the active meta-object model supports both performance and security for information access in a single uniform model, and the incorporation of it presents a new approach for workflow design which is more flexible and dynamic.","title":"ITR: Flexible and Dynamic Workflow Design: Theory and Practice","awardID":"0426886","effectiveDate":"2004-10-01","expirationDate":"2011-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"V549","name":"DARPA-HEC-URA"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7314","name":"ITR FOR NATIONAL PRIORITIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"1705","name":"BIOLOGY & INFORMATION TECHNOLO"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1106","name":"Division of HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT","abbr":"HRD"},"pgm":{"id":"5761","name":"INDUSTRY\/UNIV COOP RES CENTERS"}}],"PIcoPI":["530417","533851",257164,"194325","530418"],"PO":["469867"]},"98949":{"abstract":"Wireless communication and networking is increasingly prevalent in everyday life.

The focus is three fold: one, the development of a multi-hop wireless network prototype testbed - Hydra; two, the design and implementation of adaptive physical layer (PHY) modulation and coding schemes that significantly increase PHY flexibility; and three, the design and implementation of novel medium access control (MAC) algorithms that efficiently exploit the flexibility offered by next-generation PHYs.
