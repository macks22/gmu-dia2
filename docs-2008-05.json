{"135333":{"abstract":"This project will provide researchers in the fields of information theory, communication theory, and fundamentals of wireless networking with a grid-powered web service via a web portal interface. The web service will enable rapid execution of computationally demanding computer simulations that support the research of those working in the field. It is necessary because compute-intensive simulations are essential to progress in the field, yet the associated computational requirements often exceed the available resources of all but the largest institutions. The extant grid supplying power to the initiative leverages the idle capacity of participating computers. Rather than deploying a dedicated infrastructure, it uses existing computers in the libraries, student labs, and staff offices of the participating institution and other participating institutions that choose to donate idle resources.<br\/><br\/>The software to be run on the grid leverages an extensive free Matlab-based library developed by the Principal Investigator and used by an existing base of over 400 scientists and engineers. To simplify the user experience and obviate the need for users to purchase Matlab licenses, a web portal interface will be developed. Researchers from other institutions will be given access to the service and will be encouraged to donate their own idle computer capacity to the initiative.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: Research in the fields which this grid will serve highly mathematical. The underlying mathematics often involves multidimensional integrals that can only be solved via Monte Carlo integration or simulation. Examples include the design of efficient error correction codes, the calculation of channel capacity under modulation constraints, and the design and analysis of wireless ad hoc networking protocols. The grid-based infrastructure that lies behind the proposed web service will allow rapid parallel execution of Monte Carlo simulations. The consequence is that researchers will obtain results faster (by orders of magnitude) than could be obtained when running on a single processor. Their results will also benefit from dedicated tools for their work and the collaborations hosted by the infrastructure.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: There are both research and educational broader impacts. The research impact is that the proposed web-based simulation service and underlying grid-based infrastructure will provide world-class computing power to groups that might not otherwise have access. The proposed account creation and management policies will allow for underrepresented or disadvantaged groups or institutions to have a larger share of computing resources. Two notable forms of dissemination will be accomplished by continuing to publish the underlying software under an open source license and by presenting tutorials on the software and the infrastructure at conferences.","title":"CRI: CRD: A Web-Accessible Grid-Computing Resource for the Telecommunications Research Community","awardID":"0750821","effectiveDate":"2008-05-01","expirationDate":"2013-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7359","name":"COMPUTING RES INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":["554636"],"PO":["564181"]},"143232":{"abstract":"We propose to organize a two-day workshop on Visual Navigation with invited speakers covering a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines with emphasis on visual navigation. The goal of the workshop would be to assess the state-of-the art in this field and to critically examine future trends. Through presentations and panel discussions, our goal would be to identify a number of new research questions surrounding Visual Navigation that have intellectual merit and whose answers have the potential for broad impact. New ideas have the potential to come from a number of new developments. <br\/><br\/>One such development is the discovery of mirror neurons. This opened new avenues because it means that the motor system of the agent is an important space that is directly related to perception. Visual navigation involves movement of the agent. When an agent A observes another agent B perform a task, then agent A \"understands\" what agent B is doing because he transfers the movement to his own motor system. In other words, agents possess representations of their own actions at an abstract level. Since this abstract level is related to language, it is possible to envision navigating systems of the future that provide language descriptions of their environment. Another important development is what is broadly known in some circles as \"Hyper-empiricism\". The availability of gargantuan amounts of data facilitates the \"learning\" of a number of functions related to navigation. Lots of interesting questions arise about what to learn and how, as existing computational learning techniques are inadequate. Other developments we hope will show up at the meeting.","title":"Future Directions in Visual Navigation","awardID":"0830525","effectiveDate":"2008-05-01","expirationDate":"2009-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["460460"],"PO":["403839"]},"134553":{"abstract":"Modern computer system designers must consider many more factors than just raw performance. Thermal output, power consumption, reliability, testing, and security are quickly becoming first-order concerns. Despite various motivating factors, research efforts in optimizing computer systems have historically targeted a single logical layer in the system stack, whether it has been application code, operating systems, virtual machines, microarchitecture, or circuits. Solutions targeting a single layer in isolation are losing momentum, however, given the ever-increasing complexity of modern system and application interaction. An effective way to mitigate this complexity is to employ a holistic solution that considers multiple layers of hardware and software in conjunction, allowing software to adapt and react to changing system conditions at run time.<br\/><br\/>In this project, we are exploring the symbiotic relationship between the various hardware and software design layers, and the corresponding opportunity to provide cohesive solutions to performance, power, reliability, and temperature problems. We are focusing on adding lightweight, well-defined feedback channels to existing hardware and software. Meanwhile, we use a virtual execution environment (VEE) to collate information from various layers and to orchestrate adaptive solutions by modifying the application or OS behavior as necessary. The project provides the ability to re-factor the OS and other system layers to remove complex hardware idiosyncrasies. It also provides virtualization benefits to the underlying hardware.

This research involves the development of novel mathematical techniques for extracting and visualizing information from large data sets. The data layout, visualization, and human interaction are centered around multi-scale representations, which make it possible to access the data, the derived information and the inference processes associated with it at multiple levels of resolution. The human interaction affects both the geometry and the inference processes on the data, depending on the task at hand. The successful development of these techniques will have substantial impact on any application data which lends itself to a graph representation, such as citation networks, social networks, transaction data correlations, and many aspects of biological systems like gene expression and metabolic pathways. It will also reveal new and interesting multiscale geometric structures of high-dimensional data sets and graphs, and lead to a better understanding of how to extract information from them.<br\/>This research develops novel multiscale embedding techniques and algorithms for graphs and data sets, based on diffusion processes on graphs. Such processes are used to generate multiscale embeddings of a graph, at different scales, as well as to perform learning tasks, with and without human interaction. These multiscale embeddings have strong quantitative guarantees in terms of metric distortion. At the same time, multiscale bases are constructed which have provable capabilities of sparsely representing functions on the graph, making them very well suited for both visualization and learning.

In the above applications, the typical system consists of a group of subsystems. Each subsystem also has an embedded computer and possesses unique properties such as interacting physical and logical dynamics and decentralized decision making. Inherent to the networked embedded hybrid system is the presence of heterogeneous uncertainty. Thus, a networked embedded hybrid system is much more complex than a continuous dynamic system, on which most current control theory is based. The complexity of a networked embedded hybrid system presents major challenges in the areas of real-time information inference, control, and safety verification. Since the complex behavior of such systems with uncertainties could be modeled as a stochastic hybrid system, the objective of this NSF CAREER research is to develop theory, computationally efficient numerical algorithms, and experimental testbeds for stochastic hybrid systems, with application to mobile networked embedded systems (emphasizing air traffic control). To achieve the objective, this project is focusing on the following topics: real-time hybrid estimation and information inference algorithms and analysis methods for stochastic hybrid systems. For computational efficiency, algorithms are based on analytical formulation instead of widely-used sample-based estimation algorithms; computationally efficient numerical algorithms based on Differential Transformation are being developed for optimal control of hybrid systems, and for reachable set computation. The developed algorithms are being validated on experimental test platforms, including autonomous air vehicles.","title":"CAREER: Hybrid Estimation and Real-Time Computational Algorithms for Networked Embedded Hybrid Systems","awardID":"0746299","effectiveDate":"2008-05-01","expirationDate":"2013-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["555801"],"PO":["561889"]},"140373":{"abstract":"Message Passing Interface (MPI) is de-facto standard for communications software used by scientific parallel applications community well over last 10 years.

As our lives are increasingly conducted in the digital domain, these online activities represent a growing proportion of our interactions - from the way we acquire and share information, to the way we communicate, socialize, and organize. Such activities leave digital traces, ranging from citation patterns among millions of blogs to avatar interactions in online virtual worlds such as Second Life. <br\/><br\/>Empirical studies of these traces will address the following information diffusion and social network phenomena on an unprecedented scale and with great accuracy: 1) the interplay between social network structure, community affiliation and interaction; 2) the effect of social network structure and community boundaries on information diffusion and change; 3) the range of influence of individuals, related to the structure of their social network and community affiliation; 4) the dynamics of opinion formation in networks of overlapping communities. <br\/><br\/>The topic of information diffusion, having both theoretical and practical significance, has received sustained attention across several scientific disciplines for some time. However, past empirical studies have lacked the size and accuracy needed to differentiate between different theoretical models. To address this problem, this project will assemble three very large scale, high resolution network data sources: one encompassing the interactions of millions of users of the online virtual world Second Life, the second comprising millions of blogs, and the third mapping exact traces with a novel information and opinion sharing application that will be developed. Together, these three contexts will serve as a testbed for modeling the dynamics of information diffusion. Beyond testing existing models, this project will incorporate network community boundaries and overlap into new descriptive and predictive models of information diffusion and opinion formation. <br\/><br\/>Understanding how information diffuses and how opinions are formed in today's highly connected and community-focused online environments has important implications not just for public policy and marketing, but also for the dissemination of innovations. Knowing how to traverse community boundaries, or conversely, to target different communities separately, can also facilitate the spread and adoption of educational and community outreach efforts, including those initiated by several educational institutions in Second Life. The research will directly feed into network and data analysis courses taught by the principal investigator as part of two new social computing and information retrieval Masters of Information Science specializations. It will add to a collection of online data sets, analysis tools, and tutorials already shared by the principal investigator for educational and research purposes. Some of the online tutorials will be adapted as interactive exhibits in Second Life.

These algorithms can now automatically perform useful part-of-speech tagging, parsing and semantic interpretation. This project is creating a new-generation, multi-representational Treebank. The languages being annotated are Hindi (400K words) and Urdu (200K words). The texts are being annotated in dependency structure (trees in which all nodes are labeled with words of the sentence), enriched with additional semantic role labels. The dependency representation is also being automatically mapped to a phrase-structure representation (in which the words are at the leaves of the tree and internal nodes are labeled with phrase markers). After applying standard quality-control both versions will be released to the public, providing an immediate boost to the performance of Hindi\/Urdu NLP. A tool will also be released that will allow a researcher to produce alternative formatting of the phrase structure representation.

Prosody and kinesics such as hand gestures, head nods, facial expressions, and posture, play a crucial role in everyday communication by adding expressiveness, as well as by structuring information. Although there are different types and various levels of synchronization across these modalities, their exact mapping remains unclear. Whereas cross-modal synchronization between verbal and nonverbal modalities has been explored mostly at the semantic and discourse levels to date, in this work the PI will focus on the interplay between them at various levels of granularity. In particular, co-analyses of speech, using language and discourse models, with kinesics will be used to uncover prosodic correspondences which, in turn, will be used to develop novel algorithms for modeling dialog acts, emotions and other kinesics. The two primary goals of the project are to develop computational methods and software tools to iteratively uncover prosodic relationships between nonverbal and verbal behaviors, and to use derived prosodic relationships and their synchronizations to develop novel computational methods and software tools for the robust recognition of gestures, facial expressions, emotions, head nods, and dialog acts. The PI hopes to thereby lay the foundation for a framework for co-analysis of multimodal articulations to obtain a deeper understanding of (a) how the nucleus of an utterance and visual prosody interact to render the intent of the utterance, and (b) how synchronization with other modalities affects the production of multimodal co-articulation. To further improve the robustness and recognition accuracies, a set of classifiers will be designed and fused by taking into account the diversity among them. Systematic methods will be developed to evaluate the classifiers using various performance metrics (i.e., precision, recall, F-measures), graphical analyses and measure functions. The outcomes of the research, together with the PI's prior work, will ultimately enable the development of a perceptual interface for AutoTutor (an artificially intelligent web-based tutoring system), providing a natural means to interact with multimedia contents for instruction.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: The results of this research will have profound impact on the understanding and tracking of multimodal communications in humans and agents. The interplay between the complementary modalities and prosodic manifestations of their synchronization will also broaden the understanding of multi-channel communications in cognitive science, discourse processing, linguistics, and human-machine interaction, which will enable the development of innovative applications such as collaborative environments for agents and humans, and assistive technologies for the elderly and disabled. The long-term vision of the proposed research is to develop a perceptual interface for web-based tutoring systems such as AutoTutor. Use of an enhanced artificially intelligent web-based tutor offers significant opportunities for improving the math and science preparation of incoming engineering and science undergraduates of the Memphis City Schools and other regional or national clients. The PI will also create an online collaborative learning environment, using newer frameworks such as Web 2.0, to organize a massive amount of digital contents in such a way that communities of learners can effectively share and co-manage the information. The software and databases developed as part of this project will be made available to other researchers through the project website.","title":"CAREER: Co-analysis of Signal and Sense for Understanding Non-verbal Communications and their Applications","awardID":"0746790","effectiveDate":"2008-05-01","expirationDate":"2014-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["446710"],"PO":["565227"]},"134489":{"abstract":"Today, more and more high-performance embedded applications such as avionics and flight control, space shuttle systems, vehicles, and instrumentation in medical and emergency facilities, demand greatly increased computation capabilities from processors. Meanwhile, semiconductor manufacturing technologies keep scaling processors to smaller feature sizes. As a result, power density in processors becomes increasingly high. Due to the high power density, processors are prone to overheating, which affects not only reliability but also performance, power and cost of embedded systems. As such, thermal management becomes a prominent issue in system design. On the other hand, high-performance embedded applications demand increasingly stringent need for timing guarantees. As high-performance embedded systems become more and more thermally-constrained, the issue of how to provide timing guarantees under the constraints of thermal behavior and thermal control mechanisms must be addressed.<br\/><br\/>The objective of this NSF CAREER research project is to provide timing-guaranteed services for real-time applications while maintaining safe temperature levels for processors in high-performance embedded systems. This project focuses on development of timing-aware dynamic thermal management methodology, algorithms design analysis and system implementation in a variety of problem domains. The project seeks to significantly advance real-time system design by furthering understanding of the fundamental thermally-constrained and timing-constrained problems in high-performance embedded systems. Furthermore, this research provides an important foundation for addressing external environmental effects (such as thermal environments) on real-time systems. The impacts of this project also extend to academia through graduate and undergraduate research, curriculum development, and industrial collaboration and community outreaching.","title":"CAREER: Timing-Aware Dynamic Thermal Management in High-Performance Embedded Systems","awardID":"0746906","effectiveDate":"2008-05-01","expirationDate":"2013-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":[357536],"PO":["561889"]},"139989":{"abstract":"The purpose of the workshop is two fold: first to deliver an invigorating<br\/>educational program and second is to provide an outstanding<br\/>opportunity to bring together women students from different departments,<br\/>across the country (and possibly internationally), so as to foster a<br\/>sense of kinship and camaraderie.

Over the past decade, the diversity and ubiquity of people?s goals, interactions, and concerns with information systems have increased dramatically. Interactive computer software now permeates many individuals? working lives, and people are increasingly relying on computing and information systems for leisure and home activities as well. As a result, end users now expect considerable flexibility and control in their interactions with computer software. For many, it is no longer sufficient to consume the packaged software and scripted tasks developed by the professional software industry; they now must produce their own computational solutions to a wide variety of problems, including spreadsheet models, web sites, educational media and simulations, automated business procedures, and scientific visualizations. To produce such software, even for domain-specific problems, end users must look beyond surface-level interaction with computers and acquire the conceptual models and skills of computational thinking. But current advances toward computational thinking by end users are not evenly distributed across all segments of the population. Thus, this year?s VL\/HCC doctoral consortium, the sixth to be funded by NSF in this series, will focus on expanding the benefits of computational thinking to diverse populations. Participants will explore how varying communication media, representations, and problem-solving support affect end users? willingness and ability to access, manipulate, and program solutions to their work or everyday problems. What are the special needs of disadvantaged populations? How can computational problem-solving tools and devices be designed to meet these needs? The workshop will bring together and build community among young researchers working on different aspects of these problems from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education. It will guide the work of these new researchers by providing an opportunity for experts in the research field (as well as their peers) to give them advice, in that student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive feedback from the faculty panel. The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. A 2-page extended abstract of each participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings. The PI expects that most of the students supported by this award will come from U.S. universities, but as in past years, due to the highly international make-up of the research community, a few non-U.S. students may be invited to participate as well. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The workshop will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at alleviating a pressing problem of relevance to a great many people within our society. This event will promote discovery and learning, by encouraging the student researchers to explore a difficult and challenging open problem, through involvement of a panel of well-known researchers whose task is to provide constructive feedback, and through inclusion of other conference participants who will also learn from and provide additional feedback to the students and to each other. Members of the organizing committee will engage in a personal recruitment process through academic connections, in an effort to encourage participation by students in non-technology departments as well as from minority institutions.","title":"VL\/HCC'08 Doctoral Consortium","awardID":"0827799","effectiveDate":"2008-05-01","expirationDate":"2009-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["503162"],"PO":["565227"]},"143721":{"abstract":"This is funding to support this year's Student Design Competition (SDC), which will be part of the 2008 annual RESNA conference to be held June 26-30 in Washington DC. RESNA is the one organization with an international focus that is devoted solely to technology for individuals with disabilities. Comprised of over 1,000 individual and 200 institutional members - researchers, manufacturers, clinicians, suppliers, professionals and end-users of technology devices and equipment - the organization has as its purpose to improve the health and participation of people with disabilities in mainstream society. To this end, RESNA supports those individuals engaged in research, development, education, advocacy and the provision of technology through a number of programs and activities, which in addition to the annual conference include a credentialing program for assistive technology practitioners, suppliers and rehabilitation engineering technologists, as well as sponsored projects. RESNA serves as the ANSI-designated national body for development of voluntary standards for products used by persons with disabilities. The first SDC was held in 1980 as part of the inaugural RESNA conference. Since then, over 200 designs have been identified as winning entries, chosen from more than 600 submissions by students from over 110 different universities. SDC entries must represent the work of STUDENTS ONLY, including the documentation of the design, but both undergraduate and graduate students are eligible to submit entries. Many past participants in the event are now leaders in service, research, and educational areas related to technology for people with disabilities. Support for past SDCs has been provided by nationally recognized disability organizations such as Easter Seals and Paralyzed Veterans of America, as well as by a subsidiary of the Johnson & Johnson Company. NSF has been a supporter since 2005, and this year's funding will enable the SDC to be further expanded and enhanced so as to include more entries and support for more design teams, especially from minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities. A call for participation has been posted on the conference website, and also sent out to major colleges and universities with engineering and design schools, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities. A team of 5 judges will pre-select entries from up to 10 teams, who will be invited to attend the conference. During a half-day session in which the teams will make presentations before the judges and public audience at the conference, 5 teams will ultimately be selected as the final winners. Judges will have an opportunity to ask questions and make suggestions and recommendations to the design teams. A platform session will be held in which the 5 finalists will make presentations to the general conference attendees. All SDC teams invited to the conference will have an opportunity to present their projects in a poster session during the general conference time.

Unique in its primary focus on undergraduates, the event will provide participants with experience and skills that assist them to be successful in their engineering and design careers, and will further encourage, support and mentor students in various disciplines to become involved in the assistive technology and rehabilitation engineering fields. In an effort to help communicate and disseminate information about this important opportunity to impact the lives of individuals with disabilities, and to increase participant diversity even further both with respect to individuals and universities, NSF funding will be used in part this year to podcast the SDC for the first time.","title":"Podcasting the 2008 RESNA Student Design Competition","awardID":"0832963","effectiveDate":"2008-05-15","expirationDate":"2009-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["559082"],"PO":["565227"]},"143017":{"abstract":"It is said that the next ten years of advances in computer science could be far more significant, and far more interesting, than the past ten.

The research includes an investigation of the fundamental technologies that enable real-time large-scale network simulations<br\/>and the development of a real-time immersive network simulation environment. Real-time network simulation combines the advantages of both simulation and emulation by running simulation models that interact with the physical world. Immersive large-scale network simulation requires that the simulation not only capture important characteristics of the target global network, but also support seamless interactions with distributed applications in real time. The project is divided into three research thrusts: imprecise simulation, GPU co-simulation, and the development of the immersive network simulation environment. Imprecise simulation, extended from the imprecise computation technique originally designed for real-time systems, aims to achieve real-time performance of large-scale network simulations, by allowing the simulation to choose among models with different modeling representations and with variable computing requirements during run-time. GPU co-simulation exploits the computing resource of graphics processors, which are almost omnipresent on todays desktop computers and become more powerful than CPUs; certain numerical computations, such as the network background traffic calculation, can be offloaded to the graphics hardware, so that the CPUs can concentrate on more critical tasks for real-time simulation.

Are you (or is your business, institution, or enterprise) aware of the situation? What positive steps are you taking to ameliorate it? What further steps might \/ should be taken? This 2-day event will begin the evening of Monday, June 16 with a panel of speakers drawn from various professions and walks of life. It will continue on Tuesday, June 17 with breakout groups that will allow all attendees to speak professionally and personally about the effects of the loss of time to think. The breakout groups will be followed by several parallel-track workshops that will examine the problem and\/or potential solutions from a variety of perspectives. Finally, a closing plenary session will discuss possible concrete next steps. Participants will be selected from two main groups: people representing a number of major professions and walks of life whose work is negatively affected by the loss of time to think (e.g., lawyers, judges, physicians, nurses, health care administrators, print and broadcast journalists, K-12 teachers and school administrators, university faculty and administrators, corporate leaders and middle managers, high-tech workers, government employees, religious leaders of various faiths, artists, and homemakers), and researchers from a number of disciplines whose scholarship is relevant to the problem of the loss of time to think (e.g., computer and information science, philosophy, psychology, sociology, history of technology, neuroscience, and medicine). This workshop constitutes a follow-on to the Workshop on Information, Silence, and Sanctuary which was held in Seattle in May of 2004, and the Workshop on Mindful Work and Technology which was held in Washington DC in March of 2006, both of which were organized by the PI with partial funding provided by NSF. As with the previous two events in the series, additional funding for the current workshop is expected to come from the MacArthur Foundation.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The PI's goal is to raise public awareness of the workshop topics and to stimulate broad discussion of them. To these ends, audio and videotape recordings of the opening panel, as well as a summary videotape regarding the workshop and a written report, will be made available to the public on the workshop website. The PI also plans to approach the local NPR affiliate in Seattle (KUOW) to interest them in broadcasting the opening panel discussion, as they did for the May 2004 workshop.","title":"No Time to Think Workshop","awardID":"0833928","effectiveDate":"2008-05-15","expirationDate":"2009-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["427132"],"PO":["565227"]},"134969":{"abstract":"The investigators propose to a) develop tools for electrophysiologically realistic simulations of large areas of mammalian cortex using modern computers with many thousands of (hetero- or homogeneous) processors b) use genetic programming techniques to evolve models of primary and secondary visual cortical areas to solve difficult image processing tasks, namely image segmentation, c)understand the structure of computations performed by the brain (that is, its computational primitives) and discover the level of biological detail necessary and sufficient for these computations.<br\/><br\/>A distinguishing trait of the proposed approach is that physiological realism is not the goal, and it will be attempted only to the extent that it is needed for understanding the neural computation and for solving complex information processing tasks.

The ASSETS conference is the premier forum for presenting research results and innovations in software and technology designed to address the special needs of people with disabilities of all kinds. Researchers and developers from both academia and industry around the world will meet to exchange ideas and present reports on the latest work relating to speech, motor, hearing, and vision impairments, cognitive limitations, emotional and learning disabilities, and aging. A key component of building this community is through its youth. The ASSETS 08 doctoral consortium will provide an opportunity for graduate students from diverse backgrounds (computing, engineering, psychology, architecture, etc.) to come together and explore their research interests in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of a panel of distinguished experts in the field, so that they can see the broader spectrum of research and development approaches to assistive technologies and universal usability, and also experience the community in which they can pursue their endeavors. Student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the consortium, and will receive constructive feedback from a faculty panel. The feedback is designed to help students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to related research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. Thus, the consortium will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at assistive technologies and universal access, will promote scholarship and networking among new researchers in this emerging interdisciplinary area, and will expose these promising young researchers to a larger community. Evaluation of the consortium will be conducted, and the results made available to the organizers of future such events. A session has been set aside during the main conference to allow doctoral consortium participants to present to the entire conference, and one student from the doctoral consortium will be selected to deliver the closing plenary presentation.

Explicitly multi-threaded programs generally take longer to develop, test, debug, and verify than sequential programs with equivalent functionality. Implicit parallelization, on the other hand, allows software engineers to develop parallel algorithms and applications in environments that provide sequential semantics, like the C programming language. System tools convert the parallel algorithms into a set of threads partitioned appropriately for a particular parallel machine organization. The resulting parallel programs are easier and faster to develop, debug, and maintain, because the programmer can request a meaningful and well defined program state at any point of execution.

The workshop will produce a report to disseminate the resulting ideas to the broader community to spark continued efforts to have programming language curriculum keep pace with higher-education curricula Cutting-edge curricula are essential to prepare a U.S. workforce that is globally competitive, able to generate and to apply new knowledge, and to take the lead in advancing computer science and technology.","title":"Workshop on Modern Programming Language Curricula","awardID":"0825525","effectiveDate":"2008-05-15","expirationDate":"2010-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"H184","name":"National Security Agency"}}],"PIcoPI":["473711","561463"],"PO":["564388"]},"135770":{"abstract":"IIS - 0752768 <br\/>SGER: New Representations of Musical Sound<br\/>Bocko, Mark F.<br\/>University of Rochester<br\/><br\/>This SGER project proposes a new representation for encoding musical performances capable of capturing expressive and syntactic components of the performance and extending the ability to manipulate, analyze musical digital information. By focusing on the twin themes of music representation and recognition, new fundamental concepts will be developed that will enable the development of new tools to acquire, organize, and interpret musical knowledge. The project team has backgrounds in music theory and performance, engineering, signal processing, and physics and will conduct a number of interrelated projects that contribute to the main goal of developing a new musical language. Performance techniques of master musicians (performance professors at the University of Rochester's Eastman School of Music) will be recorded and studied with the goal of identifying the parametric representations that most accurately and compactly depict the music. From these a more robust representation of musical sounds and performance descriptors will be developed.","title":"SGER: New Representations of Musical Sound","awardID":"0752768","effectiveDate":"2008-05-01","expirationDate":"2009-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":[360639,360640,360641],"PO":["433760"]},"134571":{"abstract":"Computation has fundamentally changed the way we study nature. Recent breakthroughs in data collection technology, such as GPS and other mobile sensors, gene sequencing, and microsatellite genotyping, are giving biologists access to data about wild populations, from genetic to social interactions, that are orders of magnitude richer than any previously collected. Such data offer the promise of answering some of the big questions in population biology: How do animals form social groups and how do genetic ties affect these processes? Which individuals are leaders and to what degree do they control the behavior of others? How do social interactions affect the survival of a species? Unfortunately,in this domain,our ability to analyze data lags substantially behind our ability to collect it. There are three major drawbacks with currently available techniques for analysis of both genotypic and social structure data. First, most traditional methods are aggregate and numeric, thus they are inappropriate for identifying infrequent yet critical events, such as response to predation. Second, the newer approaches focus on human populations and are not directly applicable in the context of wildlife biology. Finally, current analysis techniques are essentially static in that all information about the time and order of social interactions or the concurrency of gene expressions is discarded. Thus, they lack the expressive and computational power to answer the questions outlined above. <br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit<br\/>The goal of this interdisciplinary research is to develop a robust and scalable computational framework for the emerging field of computational population biology. Ultimately, this research will enable biologists in their scientific inquiry to take advantage of new data by focusing on its underlying qualitative (rather than numerical) and explicitly dynamic structure. This research will use combinatorial techniques to extract that structure. In the scope of this project the following will be developed:<br\/>1. Techniques for inferring genetic relationships in wildlife populations and using them to predict genetic diversity.<br\/>2. Novel computational methodologies and tools for analyzing dynamic social interactions, focusing on prediction of interaction patterns and dynamic processes within populations.<br\/>3. Techniques for combining the genetic and the social structures of a population and across species to identify global ecological processes. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts<br\/>Many students, especially female, turn away from computer science in part because of the perceived lack of its applicability to real-world issues and impact on the society. This project has the potential to attract those who would otherwise be lost to computing by providing the view of its larger impact and connection to science. A comprehensive interdisciplinary education and outreach plan will be developed which bridges the traditional pipeline from K-12 to graduate education. The standard views of mathematics and computing will be broadened to include \"puzzle-solving\" combinatorial thinking by introducing hands-on outreach activities. The unique conflation of wild life biology and computing will continue to be presented at various forums aimed at attracting minorities and girls to science and computer science. Finally, through introduction of biological motivation in computer science courses and the computational methodology in biology courses, this research will provide the students in both disciplines with experiences in asking and answering biological questions by developing new applications of computer science. The methodologies, concepts, and tools developed as part of this interdisciplinary research will be useful to scientists in diverse fields such as behavioral ecology, conservation biology, and disease ecology. Techniques for analysis of social structures have broader relevance to human societies, especially in the context of epidemiology, dissemination of ideas, and crisis management.","title":"CAREER: Computational Tools for Population Biology","awardID":"0747369","effectiveDate":"2008-05-01","expirationDate":"2014-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"01","name":"Office of OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR                  ","abbr":"O\/D"},"div":{"id":"0111","name":"Office of CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"OCI"},"pgm":{"id":"6892","name":"CI REUSE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["533275"],"PO":["560586"]},"143350":{"abstract":"The project supports graduate student participation in the 25th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2008).

In particular, the project addresses the support of grid technologies with Web Services. Grid technology can deliver teraflops of computer cycles and peta-bytes of storage systems, interconnected by gigabit networks. But, the realization of this potential depends on the development of tools, applications and infrastructure that exploit it and lend themselves to easy deployment by end users.<br\/><br\/>The adoption of Web services in grid middleware and applications is primarily due to rich features. However, use of the currently available Web services implementation stacks can impact performance of grid applications. A critical component that is missing for Grid Web services is a set of fundamental metrics and micro-benchmarks for Web services based grid middleware\/applications that provide insights on performance limitations, bottlenecks, and opportunities for optimizations. The focus of this one year project is on the design and development of a set of core-kernel micro-benchmarks and application-class workloads for Web services -- standard sets of workloads to test the various features and performance characteristics of Web service implementations, rather than their interoperability. This public benchmark framework will provide a standard mechanism to quantify, compare, and evaluate the performance of toolkits and study the strengths and weaknesses for a wide range of representative use case scenarios. <br\/><br\/>The broader impacts of this project are that the outcome, a benchmark suite, may aid in the scientific understanding and evolution of grid middleware to meet the performance requirements necessary for adoption by the wider scientific community. The development of tools, middleware and applications that employ state-of-the-art performance enhancements and techniques will help in exploiting the true potential of the grid infrastructure for many scientific applications. The core-kernel benchmarks also have the potential of being adopted by the grid community as a standard for performance evaluation of Web services. Use of the open-source programming model and publication of documentation and tutorials on the project web page will help in dissemination of the results.","title":"SGER: Performance Analysis and Optimization of Grid Web Services","awardID":"0754129","effectiveDate":"2008-05-01","expirationDate":"2009-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["434750"],"PO":["493916"]},"139501":{"abstract":"Proposal No.: 0811541<br\/>Title: Model-based Test Generation for Embedded Software with Simulink\/Stateflow or Hybrid Automata Models<br\/>PI: Ratnesh Kumar and Changyan Zhou, Dept. of Elec. & Comp. Eng., Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA<br\/><br\/>A model-based test generation approach for embedded software systems that are reactive (interact with their environment), possess hybrid behaviors (continuous dynamics mixed with switching logics), and can be modeled using Simulink\/Stateflow or hybrid automata models, is proposed. Simulink\/Stateflow is a graphical modeling, analysis, and simulation tool for embedded software development, and is widely used in industries such as automobile, aircraft, and medical devices. The intellectual merits of this research include: (i) Translation of Simulink\/Stateflow models into hybrid automata models (to the extent possible), (ii) Test generation for hybrid systems based on discrete-behaviors preserving abstractions and system identification techniques, and (iii) Development of supporting software to be integrated with the Matlab Simulink\/Stateflow environment. The proposed research is likely to have an impact in application domains where Simulink\/Stateflow is routinely used for embedded software development. Some of the techniques developed as part of the project may find application in other areas such as verification or monitoring for fault identification. The project will support two new researchers who will be trained in model-based approaches to embedded software testing. The research outcomes, including software tools, will be made available through PIs' homepages and journal\/conference publications. The PIs are committed to recruiting minority students for the project.","title":"Model-based Test Generation for Embedded Software with Simulink\/Stateflow or Hybrid Automata Models","awardID":"0811541","effectiveDate":"2008-05-01","expirationDate":"2012-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":[370812,"554285"],"PO":["564388"]},"136597":{"abstract":"Representation is a central construct in the creative process. Exploring alternate representations can significantly increase the quality of artifacts created, and using multiple representations enables creators to broadly consider the multifaceted nature of the problem spaces they explore. Narrative offers an ideal laboratory for investigating multiple representations in the creative process because stories can be expressed in rich text (a static, uni-modal representation) re-represented in animated stories with accompanying narration and spoken dialogue (a dynamic, multimodal representation). The objective of the proposed research is to design, build, and empirically evaluate an interactive creativity environment that facilitates the exploration of alternate representations in the creative process.
