{"210940":{"abstract":"Motivation.<br\/>Discrete optimization problems have been studied by both the optimization and computer science communities. This EAGER project proposes to develop new approaches by synthesizing the ideas from the two communities by interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists and optimization specialists in mathematics and engineering. The goal is to develop rigorous and systematic approaches to discrete optimization problems by combining insights and state-of-the-art methods from integer programming (e.g., cutting planes and branch-and-bound) and algorithmic ideas from computer science (including online algorithms and machine learning). To be able to evaluate and compare methods on real-world instances, PIs plan to develop a theory of \"natural instances\". This theory starts from the application side, tries to model properties of the instances that arise from that application and then give guarantees for algorithms on such instances. The project plans to incorporate machine learning into algorithms to solve integer programs. PIs propose a systematic development of an algorithmic theory of cutting planes to identify families of instances for which they are provably efficient and to take advantage of the computational benefits of sparse cutting planes. <br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit. The ideas that are proposed here are novel and intellectually challenging. The notion of natural systems, insofar as known, has not been investigated previously. While machine learning algorithms currently use optimization technology, the reverse has not been systematically studied. Cutting planes are mainly used on an ad-hoc basis. There is no systematic theory regarding problems for which cutting plane algorithms are provably efficient. It is known that sparsity is needed in the linear algebra of cutting plane algorithms, but there is very little known about polyhedra that are defined by only sparse inequalities.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact. This EAGER project is motivated by a range of optimization problems of high societal impact from transportation and supply chain logistics such as palletizing, package delivery, petro-chemical cargo routing, vehicle and mobile robot routing to energy production and distribution. The ultimate goal is to study algorithmic optimization methods which over the next decade could lead to more than a billion dollars in annual savings in energy production and distribution, a 50% reduction in fuel consumption in supply chains and elimination of energy shortages caused by extreme weather disturbances. This will be possible by the creation of optimization algorithms that are orders of magnitude faster, more robust and capable of dealing with massive and messy data. This EAGER will provide research training for both graduate and postgraduate students and intensive collaboration among multiple EAGERs, and will provide rapid dissemination of the research throughout the relevant communities by hosting a workshop at Georgia Tech.","title":"Eager: Discrete Optimization Algorithms for 21st Century Algorithms","awardID":"1415460","effectiveDate":"2014-03-01","expirationDate":"2016-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}}],"PIcoPI":[565091,"565103",565093,"565101"],"PO":["565223"]},"210942":{"abstract":"Motivation. At the core of many societal challenges, particularly in view of sustainability and efficiency, there are hard optimization problems. While these underlying problems can be solved for smaller setups using optimization methods, realistic problem sizes are still prohibitive. Apart from the immediate challenges arising from sheer size, in today's fast-paced and intertwined economies we additionally face the challenge of addressing real-time aspects; otherwise, the obtained solutions might not apply anymore: the problem changed faster than it was solved. This EAGER addresses specific optimization problems arising from societal challenges and will motivate the study of the underlying optimization problems. For this, new methods at the intersection of continuous and discrete optimization as well as machine learning and randomization will be developed.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit. PIs set out to investigate general solution strategies to address problem size, real-time requirements, as well as uncertainty aspects using recent developments from theoretical computer science and modern optimization theory. At the core of this proposal is the study of real-world challenges related to cargo-vessel routing, palletizing, vehicle and mobile bot routing and related problems. A main difference to classical approaches is that the real-time requirements will not be added on top but will be integral to the whole design process, which is likely to result in better algorithms. Apart from the challenges from the aforementioned problems, PIs intend to develop an online expert system - Ask Minmax. This platform will leverage machine learning techniques to make the theory of optimization methods and tools accessible to industry and other personnel that face challenging optimization problems.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact. A key objective of this proposal is outreach. This EAGER will develop a consulting tool that will allow industry and the broader society to learn about most useful methods in algorithms and optimization. In particular, this tool is geared towards helping the user to make a decision regarding which methods are most likely to be applicable to their problem: in an interactive way the tool will collect information from the user about their optimization problem. The system will then determine the most likely model and provide information. Large-scale challenges in palletizing and routing require the combination of various heuristics and algorithms. A second component that will significantly impact industry is the developing of key performance indicators for such algorithms. These metrics will help to gauge efficiency of a particular heuristic and\/or algorithms, which will be important when algorithms are combined within a larger solution. Mentoring and collaborating with a graduate student, a shared postdoctoral student across multiple EAGERs, as well as hosting a workshop in relevant frontier topics at the Institute for Mathematics and Applications (IMA) are all parts of the broader impact of this EAGER.","title":"EAGER: Physical Flow and other Industrial Challenges","awardID":"1415496","effectiveDate":"2014-03-01","expirationDate":"2016-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}}],"PIcoPI":["565106",565099,565100,565101],"PO":["565223"]},"210943":{"abstract":"Motivation. The need for faster and better optimization algorithms is ubiquitous and ever increasing. Besides the sheer size of data to be analyzed, the nature of modern optimization instances presents formidable challenges with data being partially specified, uncertain or high-dimensional data. Convex optimization remains the principal workhorse, but needs to be developed in several ways to meet these challenges. This project aims to do so by (a) developing faster algorithms for convex optimization using randomization (b) making optimization algorithms robust to uncertainty, and (c) providing robust guarantees when the input is only partially specified or uncertain.<br\/><br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit. The foundational ideas of this project are novel, timely and will extend the frontier of our knowledge of optimization. They integrate multiple disciplines --- operations research, theoretical computer science, signal processing and statistical learning --- with the common goal of fast, robust and versatile convex optimization algorithms. Trading off accuracy for efficiency, the use of randomization, guarantees in the face of uncertain data and new formulations of convex optimization problems for learning, are all promising methods with wide applicability. <br\/><br\/><br\/>Broader Impact. This project is motivated by several general problems in applied mathematics that touch many different application areas.

As the copper interconnect technology is approaching its fundamental physical limit, novel on-chip interconnect materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene nano-ribbons have emerged as promising replacement materials due to properties such as superior conductivity and resilience to electromigration that otherwise have plagued copper interconnects. On the other hand, there could also be some issues for using nanotechnology interconnects such as their inferior performance as local interconnect and defects in fabrication. The PI will develop a novel co-design methodology which judiciously integrates nanotechnology into the practical VLSI circuit design together with various enabling techniques on co-design-aware buffering, layer assignment, routing, placement and clocking. The PI also proposes defect-aware techniques for mitigating the impacts due to defects, and improving robustness against faults for nanotechnology interconnects.<br\/><br\/>The broader impact of the proposed research is to significantly improve the circuit performance of nanoscale circuits. As the interconnect delay is the dominating factor of the circuit delay, the proposed research has the potential to help achieve the design closure for those difficult circuits whose timing cannot be closed even if various traditional physical synthesis optimizations have been stretched to the maximum extent. The proposed research can contribute integrated circuit design methodologies which enable the utilization of nanotechnologies into practical circuit design to defeat the fundamental limit on the prevailing VLSI technology. The PI will also develop a seamless integration of research with education such as developing the new graduate level course, developing lecture series and seminars, recruiting under-represented students, and showcasing the research results at conferences.","title":"CAREER: Integrated Research and Education in Physical Design Automation for Nanotechnology and VLSI Technology Co-Design","awardID":"1349984","effectiveDate":"2014-03-01","expirationDate":"2019-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}}],"PIcoPI":[562788],"PO":["562984"]},"210001":{"abstract":"The three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) stacks multiple dies in the vertical dimension using Through-Silicon-Vias (TSVs), which results in significantly reduced footprint, power and latency. While many challenges still exist related to 3D ICs, this project targets the one challenge that will become increasingly important in the next 5 to 10 years and may potentially end the production of 3D ICs: TSVs are quite large in size, yet their diameters do not scale with the devices due to the limitations of wafer handling and aspect ratios. On the other hand, a large number of TSVs are needed to deliver signal and power, to dissipate heat, and to provide redundancy. Moreover, foundries impose a minimum TSV density rule to maintain the planarity of the wafer during chemical and mechanical polishing (CMP). This project tackles the challenge by reconfiguring idle TSVs as devices for various circuits and systems. An opportunistic computer-aided design (CAD) framework will also be put forward for optimum utilization of the TSV devices. <br\/><br\/>The proposed research will pioneer a new and transformative direction for the advancement of 3D ICs at all the design levels - devices, circuits and CAD - with no change required in current semiconductor processes.
