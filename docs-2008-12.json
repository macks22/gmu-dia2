Processes to facilitate information access, retrieval, interpretation, verification, and validation are being defined as decision makers and public servants recognize the potential value of new social media in disaster response. To study these emergent processes, we will conduct field observations within a Joint Information Center during the Democratic National Convention, collect relevant documents such as Media Monitoring and Analysis reports, and conduct face to face interviews with key informants who supported DNC media monitoring activities or were actively engaged in policy and agenda setting for new social media during the DNC response.

DoS attacks have become an increasing threat to the reliability of the Internet. These attacks are capable of knocking any user, site, and server right off the Internet. This research targets the root cause of the DoS flooding problem: the network's inability to intelligently handle overload. When DoS attacks occur, the network drops legitimate traffic and attack traffic alike, leading to heavy losses of legitimate traffic, which in turn triggers the TCP-friendly backoff of legitimate clients, further reducing the volume of legitimate traffic. One approach to robustly distinguish legitimate and attack traffic is network capabilities. Capabilities are short-term authorizations that senders request from receivers and stamp on their packets. They allow a destination to classify traffic into two broad categories: authorized traffic and unauthorized traffic. With capabilities, the network is able to discard unauthorized traffic in favor of authorized traffic, and protects authorized communications from unauthorized attempts. This research will design and evaluate a DoS-resistant network architecture that builds on the concept of capabilities. It will also compare the costs and benefits of this solution with solutions that build on other primitives, such as black-list filters.","title":"CT-ER: A DoS-resistant Internet Architecture","awardID":"0925585","effectiveDate":"2008-12-04","expirationDate":"2010-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7371","name":"CYBER TRUST"}}],"PIcoPI":["462629"],"PO":["529429"]},"144589":{"abstract":"Loyola University, in collaboration with the University of Illinois at Chicago, the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, proposes a planning project for an effort to broaden participation in computing among students in the densely populated Chicago metropolitan area.

Such user-controlled routes are desirable for both economic and technical reasons. Economically, user-controlled routes are a key factor in maintaining the competitiveness of the ISP marketplace, just as long distance carrier selection has had a lasting impact on telephony. Technically, user-controlled routes provide a fundamental means for improving the performance and reliability of network communications. This is because they allow end systems to use multiple diverse paths concurrently and reduce the dependence on a single network path that has undesirable characteristics. The key technical difficulties associated with user controlled routes lie in the areas of scalability and robustness. This project directly addresses these issues. It involves the development of the following components: 1) a scalable inter-domain routing protocol that distributes policy-constrained domain-level maps of the network to users and allows them to explicitly formulate domain-level routes; 2) an end system protocol stack that allows various applications to take advantage of path diversity; 3) algorithms and protocols that prevent users from rapidly switching paths in a fashion that jeopardizes the overall routing stability; 4) techniques that mitigate the security threats associated with user-controlled routes (e.g. source address spoofing, multi-path denial of service attacks). <br\/><br\/>If successful, this work will have a positive economic impact that fosters ISP competition, result in measurable technical improvements in terms of reliability and performance of network communications, and contribute to education.

The event will take place on Tuesday, March 10, 2009, immediately preceding the Fourth Annual Human Robot Interaction Conference (HRI 2009) to be held March 11-13, 2009, in San Diego, which is sponsored by ACM and cosponsored by IEEE. The theme of HRI 2009 is ?Interacting Naturally with Robots,? which highlights the critical need to develop human-like communications capabilities as robots become more common in everyday settings (including the home, office, museums, and shopping environments), and begin to collaborate with humans to accomplish complex tasks. This workshop is designed to complement the conference, by providing a forum for students and recent graduates in the field of HRI to present their current research before peers and a panel of senior researchers in a setting that is less formal and more interactive than the main conference, and by providing all participants with opportunities to talk about the important trends and issues in the field with a view to encouraging the formation of collaborative relationships across disciplines and geographic boundaries. To these ends, the workshop will include sessions in a variety of formats. Participants will hear 15-minute presentations on their current research from 9 of the students, with time allotted for questions and discussion after each talk. A morning breakout session will divide the participants into 2-4 groups to discuss a focused question on common research themes posed by the organizers, while an afternoon breakout session will involve a small group project in which participants must work together to address some facet of HRI in a given domain\/application. Following a keynote address from a distinguished researcher in the field, a group presentation session will provide each breakout group with the opportunity to present a summary to the entire workshop. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This workshop will afford a unique opportunity for the best of the next generation of researchers in human-robot interaction to be exposed to and discuss current and relevant topics as they are being studied in several different research communities (including but nor limited to computer science and engineering, psychology, robotics, human factors and ergonomics, and human-computer interaction). This is important for the field, because it has been recognized that transformative advances in research in this fledgling area can only come through the melding of cross-disciplinary knowledge and multinational perspectives. Participants will be encouraged to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development, to form collaborative relationships, and to generate new research questions to be addressed during the coming year. Workshop organizers will act aggressively to recruit young researchers from minority and underrepresented groups in order to assure diversity of the participants across a variety of dimensions, so that the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field.","title":"Workshop for Student Introduction to Human Robot Interaction","awardID":"0900362","effectiveDate":"2008-12-15","expirationDate":"2009-11-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["565099"],"PO":["565227"]},"139685":{"abstract":"The discovery that synaptic plasticity is mediated by processes sensitive to the precise relative timing of pre- and post-synaptic events overturned models of synaptic change based on average activity levels (so-called rate-dependent models). This experimental discovery contradicted the conceptual framework that has dominated since the work of Donald Hebb (1949), and requires different theoretical and computational tools.<br\/><br\/>Individual synaptic events have inherent random variability, so computational synaptic dynamics in the new paradigm must be based in the theory of stochastic processes. Previous work modeling the stochastic dynamics of neural systems uses approximation tools -- the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) -- known to be deeply flawed and potentially misleading. The situation recalls the use of the FPE by machine learning theorists in the early to mid 1990s; indeed the dynamics of spike-timing-dependent plasticity in neural systems and those of stochastic approximation algorithms in the machine learning literature are very similar.<br\/><br\/>This project establishes rigorous tools for treating the stochastic dynamics of learning systems based on spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity. It develops well-grounded approximation techniques (and exact solutions where available) and applies them to synaptic dynamics in natural and artificial learning systems. The new methods are compared to those employed in the recent literature to provide insight into the accuracy and appropriateness of the various methods. The project is relevant to both computational neuroscience and machine learning, and will also provide interdisciplinary research training for graduate and undergraduate students.","title":"RI-Small: Stochastic Learning: Modeling in Machines and Brains","awardID":"0812687","effectiveDate":"2008-12-01","expirationDate":"2013-11-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["562760","516823"],"PO":["564316"]},"144571":{"abstract":"Texas A&M University, in collaboration with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Auburn University, proposes to use culturally responsive approaches to attract and retain high school students to computer science.

This project will develop novel methods to more efficiently capture and communicate this activity in environments that currently rely on human observation, verbal communication, and collective memory. More efficient teamwork capture processes will enable both larger-scale collection (which supports retrospective analysis that is critical for improved training and technology design) and contemporaneous collection (which provides real-time feedback to workers to assist in error detection). <br\/><br\/>To achieve these goals, domain-specific knowledge and probabilistic reasoning will be used to identify patterns of work and communication. The representative domain of trauma resuscitation is ideal for this work since the roles and tasks of players are well-defined and the flow of work follows a general schema regardless of the patient?s injuries. Because of the complexity of this environment, manual tracking of all activities using video recordings requires repeated review and is very time-consuming even for experienced observers. A computer system will be developed that uses video analysis to determine the location of each player, motion analysis to track their movements, and speech recognition targeted at a limited lexicon to identify their communication. Using these inputs, a probabilistic reasoning model will be constructed that correlates data from the environment with a domain-specific model of teamwork. The tagged recording of the resuscitation event will be available in real time during the event as well as post-event for analysis. <br\/><br\/>The scientific importance of this work is in the need to tag these video observations. Many forms of videos are of repetitive behaviors, whether in surveillance applications, work situations, or other uses. In all such cases, applying a grammar to the video, and matching actions and sounds to that grammar, has the possibility of greatly simplifying work analysis, which is the critical phase in the development computer support for complex, high-risk human activities. <br\/><br\/>The proposed approach will develop novel algorithms and methods for: (i) person and resource tracking in crowded collaborative environments; (ii) recognition of human activity based on fusion of unreliable data from multimodal sensors and a model of the process being recorded; and (iii) reasoning about human activities at different time scales based on heterogeneous technologies (Hidden Markov Models, Bayesian Nets, and Petri Nets) that mutually interact for activity and event detection. Moreover, the methods will be developed and evaluated in a clinical environment that currently uses limited information technology. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts. This work will also provide the foundation for implementing decision aids in environments such as trauma resuscitation and related medical domains that lack effective methods for instrumented tracking of teamwork.
