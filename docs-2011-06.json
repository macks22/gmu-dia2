Realistic modeling of material appearance is an essential component of the image synthesis process. Current approaches to material modeling include analytical modeling, numerical simulation, and image-based capture. Each approach has distinct advantages and limitations, and different ranges of applicability. The lack of unity makes material modeling difficult and has limited the useful application of computer graphics image synthesis. This transformative research will change the way materials are modeled in computer graphics systems. Rather than using disparate models as at present, this project will unify these approaches into a common physical and perceptual framework that will serve as the basis for a rich set of tools for material modeling that are physically accurate, phenomenologically expressive, computationally efficient, and easy to use. This work should enable the use of computer-aided material design methods in a wide range of economically and culturally important applications. Creating this framework will involve three subprojects.<br\/><br\/>Development of a material simulation testbed: In this subproject a suite of tools for material simulation will be developed that includes both Monte Carlo and deterministic algorithms. Different classes of materials (paints, metals, textiles) will be modeled, and different numerical methods will be tested and compared. The resulting simulation tools and a database of the simulated materials will be distributed.<br\/><br\/>Unification of analytical, simulation, and image-based capture material modeling methods: In this subproject the analytical models that represent general classes of materials will be unified with simulation and image-based capture data that represent specific material instances.

In the second part of this project methods for inferring the microstructures of materials measured using image-based capture methods will be developed. The approach will be to identify the class of a material and then vary the parameters of an appropriate simulation model to best reproduce the captured data. The results of this subproject will be expressive and efficient analytical material models that are physically grounded because they are based on captured data and rigorous simulations.<br\/><br\/>Development of perceptually-based material design tools: An important criterion for material modeling is usability. Material designers need to be able to easily specify and visualize material appearance properties. This requires consideration of the human factors in material modeling. In this subproject a series of psychophysical experiments on material perception will be conducted and the results will be used to derive perceptually-based material models with meaningful parameters. How image properties affect the visual fidelity of rendered materials will also be investigated. These findings will then be used to develop effective and easy-to-use interfaces for computer-aided material design.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Better methods for material modeling and rendering will lead to improved capability and productivity in fields such as architecture, industrial design and communication, training, cultural heritage, and entertainment. The project will build a material appearance community that stretches across academic and commercial boundaries to include computer graphics, computer vision and human vision researchers along with a range of industrial collaborators, and which focuses on developing effective solutions to real-world problems.

NSF 0917265<br\/><br\/>The two key characteristics of wireless communications that greatly impact system design and performance are randomly-varying channel conditions and limited energy resources. In wireless systems, the power of the received signal randomly fluctuates over time and distance due to multipath fading, mobility, and changing environment. Moreover, mobile wireless systems can only be equipped with limited energy resources, and hence energy efficient operation is a crucial requirement in most applications. In many wireless communication systems, in addition to energy-efficient operation, satisfying certain quality-of-service (QoS) requirements is of paramount importance in providing acceptable performance and quality. For instance, in voice over IP (VoIP), interactive-video (e.g., videoconferencing), and streaming-video applications in wireless systems, latency is a key QoS metric. Therefore, the central design challenge in next-generation wireless systems, which has the vision of providing communications anytime, anywhere in a reliable and robust fashion, is to provide the best performance levels while making efficient use of energy resources and satisfying certain QoS constraints (e.g., latency, packet loss, buffer violation probability). <br\/><br\/>The overall goal of this research is to identify the fundamental limits on the energy efficiency of wireless systems operating under queueing constraints through a unified analysis of information- and queueing-theoretic aspects. The investigators will employ a novel approach to analyze the energy efficiency by combining information-theoretic tools, such as minimum bit energy and wideband slope, with queueing-theoretic tools, such as effective bandwidth and effective capacity. This project seeks to establish a strong analytical framework by rigorously establishing fundamental limits on the energy efficiency under buffer constraints, and also at the same time has the goal of conducting experiments with a testbed and making comparisons with the theoretical findings.","title":"CIF: Small: Energy Efficiency in Wireless Communications under Queueing Constraints","awardID":"1206288","effectiveDate":"2011-06-30","expirationDate":"2014-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7935","name":"COMM & INFORMATION THEORY"}}],"PIcoPI":[512215],"PO":["564924"]},"175374":{"abstract":"Quasiconformal geometry has showed its power and flexibility in complex analysis, differential equations, function theory, and topology.

In biology and medicine it is often critical to understand processes that change the shape of anatomy.

An evolutionary biologist studying how a species has evolved to adapt to its environment would be interested in studying changes in the shape of bones found in the fossil record. The challenge in this modeling problem is that shape and shape variations are highly nonlinear and high-dimensional, and standard linear statistics cannot be applied. Therefore, the ability to model and understand changes in shape depends on the development of new regression models for data in nonlinear spaces. The research activities of this project include: (1) developing statistical models for dealing with time-varying shape using least-squares principles in shape manifolds, (2) investigating new classification methods for shape sequences, and (3) validating the methodology using synthetic data and testing its efficacy for neuroimaging applications in Alzheimer's disease and Autism.

This project aims to develop a coordinated power control framework for CMPs. The proposed framework has the following novel features. 1) It can dynamically and explicitly shift power among the CPU cores and other components in a CMP based on measured workload characteristics for optimized CMP performance within a power budget. 2) It adopts an online model estimator to dynamically measure the performance contributed by each component and then partitions the chip-level power budget among the components. 3) It can achieve fair or differentiated cache sharing under the impacts of dynamic cache resizing used in CMP power control. 4) It also coordinates components within a core for core-level power control and coordinates CMPs with main memory and disks for optimized system performance. 5) Our framework is based on a control-theoretic foundation for systematically and rigorously developing power control strategies. While basic control theory has already shown great promise in microprocessor power management, an important feature of our framework is that it relies on advanced optimal control theory to coordinate multiple control and optimization loops in different layers of a CMP in a holistic way for optimized performance and guaranteed stability. <br\/><br\/>In addition to integrating research with education and outreach programs, the outcome of this research is expected to provide effective mechanism and a rich set of tools fer performance and power optimization in CMPs.","title":"SHF: Small: Coordinated Performance Optimization within a Power Budget for Chip Multiprocessors","awardID":"1143605","effectiveDate":"2011-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7941","name":"COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["554423"],"PO":["366560"]},"177225":{"abstract":"This award focuses on problems in computational complexity theory, with the goal of clarifying the power and limitations of various important classes of algorithms (known as \"complexity classes\").

Unfortunately, the infrastructure to design and conduct in ferro experiments over massive datasets has not kept pace with our collective ability to create these datasets. Computational modelers, who have long enjoyed the benefits of a research focus on creating larger and faster CPU farms, now face terabytes of simulation results in which deep insights into the health of the planet remain locked.

Realistic modeling of material appearance is an essential component of the image synthesis process. Current approaches to material modeling include analytical modeling, numerical simulation, and image-based capture. Each approach has distinct advantages and limitations, and different ranges of applicability. The lack of unity makes material modeling difficult and has limited the useful application of computer graphics image synthesis. This transformative research will change the way materials are modeled in computer graphics systems. Rather than using disparate models as at present, this project will unify these approaches into a common physical and perceptual framework that will serve as the basis for a rich set of tools for material modeling that are physically accurate, phenomenologically expressive, computationally efficient, and easy to use. This work should enable the use of computer-aided material design methods in a wide range of economically and culturally important applications. Creating this framework will involve three subprojects.<br\/><br\/>Development of a material simulation testbed: In this subproject a suite of tools for material simulation will be developed that includes both Monte Carlo and deterministic algorithms. Different classes of materials (paints, metals, textiles) will be modeled, and different numerical methods will be tested and compared. The resulting simulation tools and a database of the simulated materials will be distributed.<br\/><br\/>Unification of analytical, simulation, and image-based capture material modeling methods: In this subproject the analytical models that represent general classes of materials will be unified with simulation and image-based capture data that represent specific material instances. In the first part of this subproject simulation and capture data will be fit with a range of analytical models, considering both individual materials and \"families\" of materials generated by progressively changing the parameters of the simulation models. In the second part of this project methods for inferring the microstructures of materials measured using image-based capture methods will be developed. The approach will be to identify the class of a material and then vary the parameters of an appropriate simulation model to best reproduce the captured data. The results of this subproject will be expressive and efficient analytical material models that are physically grounded because they are based on captured data and rigorous simulations.<br\/><br\/>Development of perceptually-based material design tools: An important criterion for material modeling is usability. Material designers need to be able to easily specify and visualize material appearance properties. This requires consideration of the human factors in material modeling. In this subproject a series of psychophysical experiments on material perception will be conducted and the results will be used to derive perceptually-based material models with meaningful parameters. How image properties affect the visual fidelity of rendered materials will also be investigated. These findings will then be used to develop effective and easy-to-use interfaces for computer-aided material design.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Better methods for material modeling and rendering will lead to improved capability and productivity in fields such as architecture, industrial design and communication, training, cultural heritage, and entertainment. The project will build a material appearance community that stretches across academic and commercial boundaries to include computer graphics, computer vision and human vision researchers along with a range of industrial collaborators, and which focuses on developing effective solutions to real-world problems. The research will engage and train groups of students at 3 universities for scientific\/technical careers that require working in interdisciplinary teams and partnering with coworkers in remote locations.","title":"G&V: Medium: Collaborative Research: A Unified Approach to Material Appearance Modeling","awardID":"1064412","effectiveDate":"2011-06-01","expirationDate":"2015-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7453","name":"GRAPHICS & VISUALIZATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["541919"],"PO":["565227"]},"184661":{"abstract":"This grant provides travel and subsistence to students so that they can attend the Symposium on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), which this year is being held San Jose, California in June 2011 as part of the Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC).

Without effective analysis tools, results from these large-scale simulations cannot be utilized to their fullest extent. This research addresses the problem of large-data visualization and exploration by employing interactive multi-scale machine learning, which exploits an efficient feature-based, multi-resolution representation of the data. The investigators are leveraging methods from the field of machine learning to perform two distinct tasks: identify regions of interest and enhance robustness of feature detection algorithms. The primary outcome of this effort is the realization of a framework for exploring large datasets. Further, this work is introducing a large body of work in machine learning to the field of visualization. Successful completion of this research will help overcome the brittleness of existing visualization methods and foster expedient discovery in many areas of science and engineering.<br\/><br\/>The multi-resolution techniques developed here will employ a two-fold strategy. First, semi-supervised learning based on training with the domain expert is used to develop strategies for selective spatial and temporal refinement of the data. A classifier is constructed to tag the output of the coarse resolution feature detection (i.e. regions) as either interesting or not interesting. Then at the finest scale, interesting local data chunks containing features of interest are identified for further analysis. Second, several local feature detection algorithms, or weak classifiers, are combined into a single, more robust compound classifier using adaptive boosting, or AdaBoost, and a data adaptive variant called CAVIAR that facilitates validated feature detection. Ideally, the compound classifier combines the best of all weak classifiers as they respond to the underlying physical signal. This research is demonstrating the effectiveness of these methods by applying existing local detection algorithms for visualizing vortices in turbulent flow fields.","title":"G&V: Medium: Collaborative Research: Large Data Visualization Using An Interactive Machine Learning Framework","awardID":"1065025","effectiveDate":"2011-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7453","name":"GRAPHICS & VISUALIZATION"}}],"PIcoPI":[475211,"533228"],"PO":["565227"]},"181285":{"abstract":"In recent years, the microprocessor design industry has made an aggressive transition to chip-multiprocessor designs, where additional device resources provided by continued semiconductor fabrication process scaling are dedicated to providing ever-increasing numbers of processor cores per die.

Similarly, the multiple processing cores must coordinate their accesses to shared resources like input\/output subsystems as well as off-chip connectivity to other chips and main memory. Providing a scalable and low-overhead communication substrate, or network on chip, for such activities is one of the most pressing challenges faced by designers today.

These networks and protocols provide highly-scalable performance while minimizing power and area overheads, hence enabling processor chips that deliver unprecedented levels of performance.

Although digital records seem easier to find than their older paper counterparts, rapid growth in the volume, diversity, and possible locations of these records has actually made it harder to find the proverbial needles within the digital haystacks. The resulting rapid increase in the cost of discovery and exchange of relevant evidence, if left unchecked, raises concerns about access to justice. Hence, there is an urgent need for demonstrably accurate and cost-effective technologies to support \"e-discovery\" of the relevant records.<br\/><br\/>Professor Douglas W. Oard and colleagues of the University of Maryland are developing techniques to automatically decide within minutes the responsiveness of more documents than one person could examine in a lifetime. These techniques use \"semi-supervised learning\" algorithms for \"training\" the software to replicate the kinds of decisions that people make on representative examples. Using Finite Population Annotation, a new framework for integrating learning with evaluation, novel methods are being developed to achieve and measure the highest possible effectiveness for any specified level of human effort. These learning methods draw on rich approaches to representing the content of both born-digital structured documents and scanned paper. Measures for rigorously assessing the effectiveness of the resulting automated review techniques are being developed both to support decisions by legal professionals and by the courts about which methods to use, and to help developers further improve their algorithms.<br\/><br\/>The legal system demands technology whose effectiveness has been demonstrated on collections that are representative of what is actually expected in a real case. For that reason, this project is creating real world benchmarks in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Text Retrieval Conference (TREC). The project's results are expected to help to shape professional practice through workshops for legal and technical stakeholders, and through university courses to prepare the next generation of attorneys and information professionals to employ these new capabilities. \"E-discovery\" technologies resulting from this effort are likely to be broadly applicable in domains beyond the law practice, including preparation of systematic reviews of scientific literature, scholarly access to digital archives, and government responses to public information requests from citizens.

Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference. Student participants will make formal presentations of their research during the workshop, and will receive feedback from the faculty panel. The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other OCIS research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. Student participants will present their work to the doctoral consortium on August 12-13, with follow up activities planned during the technical program of the conference. The OCIS conference management committee will evaluate the doctoral consortium, and the results will be made available to the organizers of future consortia. The OCIS doctoral consortia have been highly successful in providing a forum for the initial socialization into the field of young doctoral scholars; many of today's leading researchers participated as students in earlier consortia.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The annual OCIS doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of researchers in organizational communication and information systems, allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.

The organizers will try explicitly to identify and include the broadest possible group of highly qualified participants, and in particular will consider gender in the participant selection process with a target of a 50\/50 split. As a consequence of these steps, the student and faculty participants will constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, which will help broaden the students' horizons to the future benefit of the field.","title":"WORKSHOP: Organizational Communications and Information Systems Doctoral Consortium","awardID":"1102558","effectiveDate":"2011-06-01","expirationDate":"2011-11-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["565342"],"PO":["564456"]},"178207":{"abstract":"Conflicts of interest pervade collective decision-making among peers. Such conflicts can be modeled as the tension between two distinct components of an agent's evaluation of the final outcome: her selfish interest and her disinterested opinion. When those two orderings are logically separated, sometimes a rule can be designed that aggregates individual opinions while preventing an agent's message having any impact on her selfish welfare. Such a rule is called impartial. This project focuses on two simple problems, the award of an indivisible private good (a prize) and peer ranking, when agents care selfishly only about winning the prize, or their own ranking. There exist fairly simple voting rules where your vote cannot make you win or lose the prize, yet it influences who wins if you do not. It is also possible to design a peer ranking system where an agent has no influence on his own ranking, but contributes to that of his peers. Some of the impartial decision rules to which the project is devoted resemble familiar voting rules such as qualified majorities, or the median vote on a line. One output of the research consists of practical mechanisms as universally applicable as any other voting rule. Another direction is to ask which general patterns of selfish interest versus selfless opinions allow for impartial rules, and which do not. The project contributes to the broad stream of economics research on mechanism design concentrating on the strategic distortions of information revelation.<br\/>Peer evaluation is a central institution in business partnerships, academic communities, and virtually any community sharing specialized knowledge. Evaluating specialized work requires knowledge that can only be found among those experts; it cannot be entrusted to an impartial but clueless outside observer. Academics pick some of their own for Nobel prizes, and movie professionals award the Oscars. Peer evaluations are vulnerable to conflicts of interest: a participant may be tempted to corrupt her disinterested opinion (a valuable piece of information to determine the correct decision) to serve her selfish interests, which by contrast are often useless to the group. Some examples of such corruption are easy to avoid: judges in sports competitions should not rank athletes of their own countries, spouses cannot testify for or against each other, etc. More subtle ones, such as the multiplication of fake (favorable or critical) reviews on the Internet can only be avoided by the clever design of the evaluation process. This project aims to construct a handful of decision mechanisms immune to conflicts of interest, applicable directly to the division of money between business partners, the award of a prize among peers, and the ranking of Universities by their own students and alumni. This foundational research has potential for much broader impact in the setting of the Internet, where peer evaluations are ubiquitous- from reputation scores for electronic traders (on EBay or Amazon), to the users of social networks (Epinions, Twitter), and the scoring and ranking systems of web pages by search engines, relying exclusively on the pattern of mutual links between pages.","title":"ICES: Small: Impartial decision making in distributed systems","awardID":"1101202","effectiveDate":"2011-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"8052","name":"Inter Com Sci Econ Soc S (ICE)"}}],"PIcoPI":[477807],"PO":["565251"]},"181420":{"abstract":"One of the major concerns that practitioners have about theoretical machine learning is the focus on distributions where the attributes are independent: in other words, knowing one attribute gives no information about any others. As an example, while it is plausible that height and eye color are independent, it is much less believable that height and weight are independent. Thus, the output given by any algorithm that is based on the assumption that the attributes of a person (such as height and weight) are independent cannot be trusted. The goal of this project is to extend what we know about the theory of such problems while removing some of the mathematically convenient assumptions such as independence. <br\/><br\/>The tools used focus on discrete Fourier analysis, but involve many other techniques from mathematics such as functional analysis and representation theory of finite groups. One recurring technique is the application of the \"noise sensitivity\" method, which quantifies the complexity of a function based on how similar the value of the function is on some input to the values of that input's neighbors. In many cases, the goal is to show that the Fourier spectrum of certain classes of functions is predictable; often, this predictability is a key component of algorithms for machine learning. <br\/><br\/>The broader goal of this project is to discover new connections between mathematics and computer science with a special focus on questions motivated by machine learning. Answers to the underlying questions would be useful to theoreticians and could lead to better applied machine learning algorithms. Also, the mathematical questions raised are interesting independently of the machine learning connection.

Existing systems rely heavily on multiple disk replication to guard against data loss due to device failure, but consuming multiple times more storage space drastically increases the cost for hardware, and especially the cost to operate (building space, power, cooling, and maintenance). The goal of this research project is to develop new erasure coding technology, in lieu of simple replication, to realize a space-efficient, energy-efficient, quantifiably-reliable, and massively-scalable storage systems.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit lies in the development of a feasible approach that relies on the strength of efficient erasure codes distributed across the storage disks and nodes that can be used to build next-generation green data centers, and to transform existing ones. While the benefits of erasure coding in saving storage space is well understood in theory, good and practical erasure codes are hard to design. The PI will build new and optimal erasure codes by exploiting graph theory, finite geometry and combinatorics. Some of these codes have the potential to simultaneously achieve the optimal space efficiency and the minimum complexity promised by the theory. To make erasure-coding efficient and scalable, the PI will also extend the design of single erasure coding to nested\/layered coding through hierarchical multiple protection. <br\/><br\/>In view of the critical importance of energy efficiency, developing green data center technologies will have profound impacts scientifically and to the larger society.

The long-running VL\/HCC series occupies a unique niche among HCI and Programming Language conferences, in that it focuses specifically on how to help end users successfully develop and use software. Recent advances in computing have led to continually deeper integration between computers and human society. People now swim in a \"sea\" of socio-technical systems that synthesize large numbers of contributing users with vast amounts of source code. Examples include social media systems, open source repositories, online marketplaces and massively multiplayer online games. Yet as the socio-technical systems in this sea have grown in complexity, they have become increasingly difficult for end users to understand and direct toward productive ends. Thus, when users put data into a system they may be unable to anticipate and control how their data will be used by other people or by software in the system; when users take actions in the system they often cannot foresee and manage unintended effects on other users, software, or the system as a whole, particularly because the system's software often contains defects. These problems are further complicated by the fact that different users simultaneously might take actions toward differing goals, while autonomous software such as agents might meanwhile also take actions toward goals of their own. These and similar problems reflect a fundamental lack of sufficient methods, models and tools to help end users visualize, analyze, tailor, and manage large socio-technical systems. At a deeper level, insufficient theory is available for predicting the complicated, unstable, sometimes-emergent behavior that results when large numbers of diverse, unpredictable humans are coupled to unreliable software.<br\/><br\/>This year's VL\/HCC Doctoral Consortium, the ninth to be funded by NSF in this series, will focus on advancing knowledge and understanding of solutions to these problems. The workshop will bring together and build community among young researchers working on different aspects of these problems from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education. It will guide the work of these new researchers by providing an opportunity for experts in the research field (as well as their peers) to give them advice, in that student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive feedback from a faculty panel.

Today, between 40 and 56 million people in the United States report some type of disability, and this number will likely grow in the coming years as the baby boom generation enters late life. RESNA (formerly the Rehabilitation Engineering Society of North America) is the one organization with an international focus that is devoted solely to technology for individuals with disabilities. RESNA's membership consists of individuals and institutions covering a range of disciplines (including researchers, clinicians, suppliers, manufacturers, consumers and educators who work in non-profit and for-profit settings), all of whom are dedicated to promoting the exchange of ideas and information for the advancement of assistive technology. In addition to its annual conference, RESNA conducts a credentialing program for assistive technology practitioners, rehabilitation engineering technologists and suppliers, as well as sponsored projects. RESNA's Technical Standards Board is the U.S. Technical Advisory Group to ANSI, the official U.S. representative to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), for the development of ISO standards pertaining to assistive technology and other products for persons with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>The RESNA Student Design Competition fosters innovation and creativity with the ultimate goal of producing technology that can contribute to the independence of individuals with disabilities. The first SDC was held in 1980 as part of the inaugural RESNA conference. Since then, over 200 designs have been identified as winning entries, chosen from more than 600 submissions by students from over 115 different universities. SDC entries are required to represent the work of students ONLY, including the design documentation; both undergraduates and graduates are eligible to take part. Many past participants in the event are now leaders in service, research, and educational areas related to technology for people with disabilities. Some past student designs have been patented and are now available commercially. NSF has been a supporter since 2005. This year's funding will enable the SDC to be further expanded and enhanced, so as to include more entries and support for more design teams, especially from minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities. A call for participation has been posted on the conference website, and also distributed electronically to a large number of colleges and universities with engineering and design schools. A team of 5 judges will pre-select entries from up to 10 teams, from which two members each will be invited to attend the conference supported with travel and hotel funds as well as complimentary registration. During a half-day session in which the teams will make presentations before the judges and public audience at the conference, 5 teams will ultimately be selected as the final winners. Judges will have an opportunity to ask questions and make suggestions and recommendations to the design teams. A platform session will be held in which the 5 finalists will make presentations to the general conference attendees. All SDC teams invited to the conference will have an opportunity to present their projects in a poster session during the general conference time.

Unique in its primary focus on undergraduates, the event provides participants with experience and skills that help them succeed in their engineering and design careers. It further encourages and mentors students in various disciplines to become involved in the assistive technology and rehabilitation engineering fields, and also provides an opportunity for the students to network with their peers and rehabilitation engineers, many of whom participated in previous SDC competitions. In an effort to increase the diversity of submissions to the SDC in future years, this year's participants will build web pages to illustrate their design and design process. Not only will young scientists benefit from this medium of dissemination but professors and those who teach will also be able to share this information with their students as examples of projects that others have done. The content of all submissions, not just the finalists, will be captured and accessed through the RESNA website.

The social aspect leverages the trust people place in their connections and ae often viewed as more credible than a mass alert or news report. Use of social media by other than social contacts raises privacy issues, since they can be readily monitored, even though the social media have certain privacy expectations. Although alert and warning issues have been extensively studied and social media have been the subject of research in computer science and the social sciences, relatively little is known about the use of social media for national alerts and associated privacy considerations. Developing a fuller understanding of the privacy issues and other aspects of social alert systems will be the focus of two workshops at the National Academy of Sciences.

In this project, we focus on the energy efficiency of an important type of computer applications, the database management systems (DBMS), which often consume a large portion of the computing resources and energy in modern data centers. The goal of this project is to design and implement a DBMS that enables significant energy conservation with graceful degradation of query processing performance. The project achieves its goal using the following approaches: (1) Dynamically exploit the energy-performance tradeoffs in DBMS as well as low-power modes of hardware systems for improved energy efficiency with performance guarantees; (2) Formulate the energy-efficient DBMS design as a feedback control problem, and adopt appropriate formal control techniques to achieve the desired performance and energy efficiency with theoretical analysis and guarantees; (3) Apply advanced multi-stage optimization methods to solve complex energy-aware storage management problems; and (4) Coordinate various control and optimization loops in different layers of the DBMS for maximized energy savings and global system stability. The broader impacts of the project are at two levels. At the society level, the reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emission by implementing the proposed energy-aware DBMS can be substantial. The project can benefit a large number of industrial sectors, the operations of which depend heavily on database-supported software such as online retailing systems, financial management software, and social networking platforms, by significantly lowering their electricity cost.

Recent advances in motor behavior have uncovered structure in the supporting neural control architecture, including distinctions between feed-forward and feedback control functions and learning. While the neural code has not yet been cracked, much is now known about how its foundations for sensorimotor control differ from those of even the most modern computer-based algorithms. For example, neural function must accommodate transmission and processing delays, so feedback control is subservient to feed-forward and anticipatory control. The nervous system produces exquisite, constantly and widely available predictions concerning body and environment interactions. These predictive models (also called internal models) are constructed by learning the invariants in the mapping from motor commands to sensory feedback (and inverses thereof). The PIs have developed a unique approach based upon readings from a scalp array of EEG electrodes for the construction of algorithms (decoders) which predict motor behavior (control signals) as a weighted sum of the EEG data from all electrodes at multiple time lags. The team has demonstrated two-axis control over a screen cursor using only 10 minutes of EEG and motion training data, a feat far surpassing any brain-computer interface (BCI) available to date. In the current project, the team will build upon this prior work to design and validate noninvasive neural decoders that generate agile control in upper limb prosthetics. To this end, they will investigate neural correlates of brain adaptation to multiple sources of feedback using EEG and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIR). An important challenge will be to provide sensory feedback appropriate to contact tasks performed with a prosthesis. Existing BCIs and neuro-prosthetic devices rely at best on vibrotactile feedback and often only on visual feedback. The PIs will add haptic and proprioceptive feedback in concert with a novel adaptation of vibrotactile, skin stretch, and arm squeeze technologies in the prosthesis interface, to provide intuitive control over contact tasks and to strengthen the motor imagery whose neural correlates are processed by the EEG decoder. To establish baseline measures, the team will compare prosthetic performance under direct brain control to myoelectric prosthetic control and direct manual control. Experiments will be performed involving both able-bodied individuals and amputees, in which real-time decoding (EEG) and analysis (EEG\/fNIR) of sensorimotor control and cognitive load will be combined.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This research will revolutionize the control and interface of upper limb prosthetics. The work will lead to a better understanding of the role of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and will lay the foundation for restoration of motor and sensory function for amputees and individuals with neurological disease. The project will create a unique interdisciplinary environment enabling education, training, co-advising and exchange of graduate students, course development, and involvement of undergraduates in research. The PIs will also participate in outreach activities on their various campuses, targeting underrepresented groups in science and engineering.","title":"HCC: Medium: Collaborative Research: Improved Control and Sensory Feedback for Neuroprosthetics","awardID":"1065027","effectiveDate":"2011-06-01","expirationDate":"2015-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["550636"],"PO":["565227"]},"176193":{"abstract":"The goal of this project is to build a new software infrastructure for<br\/>continuing research on compiler optimizations for tensor computations.<br\/>Motivated by the successes of the model-driven search-based<br\/>optimization approach of the Tensor Contraction Engine (TCE) and the<br\/>polyhedral model-based transformations, an optimization infrastructure<br\/>is being developed that combines the key aspects of the TCE and the<br\/>polyhedral models and provides the flexibility to continue research on<br\/>optimizing and automatically parallelizing tensor computations for<br\/>parallel and\/or distributed computations for any machine architecture,<br\/>including multi-cores and GPUs.<br\/><br\/>This novel optimization framework has potential for high payoffs in<br\/>enabling future research and eventually in generating high-performance<br\/>code for an important class of quantum chemistry codes and other<br\/>tensor computations.

Second, several local feature detection algorithms, or weak classifiers, are combined into a single, more robust compound classifier using adaptive boosting, or AdaBoost, and a data adaptive variant called CAVIAR that facilitates validated feature detection. Ideally, the compound classifier combines the best of all weak classifiers as they respond to the underlying physical signal. This research is demonstrating the effectiveness of these methods by applying existing local detection algorithms for visualizing vortices in turbulent flow fields.","title":"G&V: Medium: Collaborative Research: Large Data Visualization Using An Interactive Machine Learning Framework","awardID":"1065081","effectiveDate":"2011-06-01","expirationDate":"2016-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7453","name":"GRAPHICS & VISUALIZATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["499432"],"PO":["565227"]},"176184":{"abstract":"Building large scale annotated resources is crucial for basic and applied research in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our major long term goal of this project is to make very substantial extensions to an existing unique resource, the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB), developed under prior NSF support, augmenting it with a variety of new annotations as well as refining earlier annotations. Our proposed work involves conducting some new annotations and some pilot experiments to confirm the strategies for augmentation. A further goal is to bring together a cross section of potential users of this resource, first to acquaint them with the potential of this resource as well as to get their feedback for guiding further augmentations. Applications of PDTB for the task of summarization have already been made. Future applications are in the areas of information extraction, question-generation, and machine translation among others. On the theoretical side, our resource will prove useful in increased theoretical understanding of discourse structure of language.","title":"CI: ADDO-EN: Significant Enhancement of the Exisitng Penn Discourse Treebank","awardID":"1059353","effectiveDate":"2011-06-01","expirationDate":"2013-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7359","name":"COMPUTING RES INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":[472144],"PO":["565215"]},"184270":{"abstract":"This award provides travel support to enable graduate student participation in a conference held at Carnegie Mellon University on March 8-9, 2011, on the subject of \"Emerging Behavior in the Changing Electric Energy Industry.\"<br\/><br\/>As new and unconventional technologies become connected to the electric power grid, and the system is driven by qualitatively new economic and environmental objectives, new phenomena will emerge. Some of these may lower cost and improve reliability, but some will challenge the stability and reliability of the electricity system. For example, if a large proportion of residential and commercial customers have solar panels that feed electricity into the grid when the sun is shining, but abruptly require power when a cloud passes over the sun, the dynamic stresses on the grid will increase, perhaps to unmanageable levels. A system based on minimizing costs with current rules for preserving stability and reliability could lead to unacceptable service. Before making these changes in technology and management practices, it would be prudent to understand the challenges that the current system faces, the reasons for its relatively good record of reliability, and how the system will be challenged by the changes.<br\/><br\/>The focus of the meeting is on unintended consequences of changes in the electricity system. Topics include causes, modeling, and dynamics of hard-to-predict emerging technical and economic phenomena. The meeting focuses on issues affecting the smart grid, dynamic pricing, and decentralized generation (including net metering for an area with a high penetration of solar self-generation). The objective is to identify fundamental approaches for transforming today's operating and planning industry practices, and to identify supporting policies that can manage short-and long-term uncertainty and ensure sustainable electricity services.","title":"Electricity Conference on Emerging Behavior in the Changing Electric Energy Industry","awardID":"1132763","effectiveDate":"2011-06-15","expirationDate":"2012-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["563201"],"PO":["561889"]},"176174":{"abstract":"This project develops a mobile distributed vehicular testbed equipped with sensory and communication devices for experimentation with emerging networking and application development challenges in the domain of vehicular participatory sensing. The project is motivated by the emergence of a new type of computing and social applications enabled by the proliferation of sensors of everyday use, such as GPS devices and car speedometers. These applications rely on self-selected communities of volunteers to perform data collection and sharing for purposes of mutual interest. Of particular interest to this project are applications that help reduce transportation energy cost and carbon footprint. For example, by sharing data on speed, fuel efficiency, and location of vehicles, better real-time navigation services can be developed that guide drivers to routes that are maximally fuel-efficient for their cars, hence reducing transportation carbon footprint. The testbed facilitates the investigation of several research challenges towards enabling such applications including the investigation of data privacy, energy-efficiency, disruption-tolerant communication, social networking, and management of interactive complexity. No common testbed is currently available that allows researchers to experiment with a live vehicular data collection system of non-trivial size for the purposes of investigating such challenges. By building such a testbed, this project helps usher in a new era of sensing applications with more integration of humans, networks, and the physical world, which may have a significant impact on the economy, energy, and the environment by reducing transportation energy cost and carbon footprint.","title":"II-NEW: Vehicular Instrumentation for Green Sensor-Enabled Research","awardID":"1059294","effectiveDate":"2011-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7359","name":"COMPUTING RES INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["553633","561785"],"PO":["564778"]},"175383":{"abstract":"While not perfect, the depth and breadth of what today's automated analysis tools can figure out about a program is truly remarkable. Yet, despite the prevalence and cost of software defects and despite the wealth of information such automated tools could provide, program analyzers are largely ignored by today's software engineers. This situation is not due to a lack of interest from software engineers or a lack of effort in deployment from analysis experts but rather a gap in the way a tool and its user reasons about the program, which results in, for example, a difficulty in providing analysis results understandable to the user. This research confronts closing this user-tool reasoning gap.<br\/><br\/>The focus of the work is an effective approach to user-driven refinement of the analysis process. Novel techniques for generating explanations of program analysis results will be created. New approaches for trading off the exhaustiveness of compile-time verification and the simplicity of run-time checking will be developed. Together with prior work on user-centric analysis specifications, this project lays the foundation for tomorrow's tools where users and tools cooperate to reason effectively about programs. Significant potential impacts include the following: a change in the way software engineers view program analysis--replacing a magic box with a transparent reasoning assistant, improved software quality as a result of this change in view, and tools that engage students in algorithmic thinking in a hands-on manner.","title":"CAREER: Cooperative Program Analysis: Bridging the Gap Between User and Tool Reasoning","awardID":"1055066","effectiveDate":"2011-06-01","expirationDate":"2016-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["518195"],"PO":["565264"]},"175295":{"abstract":"Many natural, social and engineered systems exhibit or facilitate complex behavior.

We now have a wide range of on-line social networks (OSNs) such as Facebook, Twitter, mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and delay tolerant networks (DTNs). These networks pervade all aspects of our lives and provide a growing range of services in commerce, business, communications, and connectivity. Many of these networks are continually in a dynamic state of flux and\/or extremely large. For example, the topology of a MANET or a DTN is constantly changing, and that of an OSN such as Facebook is rapidly growing and evolving. The modeling, analysis, and measurement of such networks are challenging, due to their dynamism and sizes. As a consequence, traditional mathematical techniques are not suitable and fundamentally new techniques are needed.<br\/><br\/>This research will focus on three interrelated problems. The first is to develop useful and accurate models that capture the dynamics of today?s social and technological networks. The second is to develop and study a class of techniques for characterizing and searching such networks. These techniques are based on a very simple mechanism, namely to let an agent explore the network by randomly choosing where to go. This is known as a random walk in the mathematics literature and has been shown to exhibit desirable search and characterization properties in static networks that shows promise in dynamic networks. Last, many static networks exhibit what is known as a power law, namely that the distribution for the number of neighbors of a node roughly decays as k&#8722;a where k is the number of neighbors and a is a positive constant greater than one. The third problem is to understand what constitutes a power law in a dynamic network, how this power law comes to be, and what implications there might be regarding the health of the network.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact. The work will positively impact society by providing a deeper understanding of and a set of tools for managing and monitoring digital networks such as MANETs and OSNs. The project includes a comprehensive dissemination plan including public release of tools for network characterization. The education plan includes cross-specialty seminars, undergraduate involvement in research through a REU site, and international outreach to South America.","title":"NetSE: Medium: Modeling and Analysis of Network Dynamics","awardID":"1065133","effectiveDate":"2011-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7794","name":"NETWORK SCIENCE & ENGINEERING"}}],"PIcoPI":[475281,"545655","526867"],"PO":["564993"]}}
