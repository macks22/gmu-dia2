Much of this data originates from on-line sensors that act as streaming data sources, providing a continuous flow of information. As sensor sources proliferate, the flow of data becomes a deluge, and the extraction and delivery of important features in a timely and comprehensible manner becomes an ever increasingly difficult problem. More specifically, developing data mining and assimilation tools for data deluged applications faces three fundamental challenges. The amount of distributed real time streaming data is so large that even current extreme scale computing cannot effectively process it. Second, today's broadly deployable network protocols and web services do not provide the low latency and high bandwidth required by high volume real time data streams and distributed computing resources connected<br\/>over networks with high bandwidth delay products. Finally, the vast majority of today's statistical and data mining algorithms assume that all the data is co-located and at rest in files. Here, the real time data streams are distributed and the applications that consume them must be optimized to process multiple high volume real time streams. The goal is to develop novel algorithms and hardware acceleration schemes to allow real-time statistical modeling and change detection on such large-scale streaming data sets. By using Service Oriented Architecture principles, a framework for integrating high -performance change detection software services, including accelerations of commonly used kernels in statistical modeling, into a Grid messaging substrate will be developed and tested. Geographical Information System (GIS) services will be supported using<br\/>Open Geospatial Consortium standards to enable geo-referencing. <br\/><br\/>This project has the potential to have near-term and long-term impact in several important areas. In the near-term, the implementation of kernels and modules of statistical modeling and change detection algorithms will allow the end-user applications (e.g., homeland security, defense) to achieve one to two orders of magnitude improvement in performance for data driven decision support. In the longer term, the availability of toolkits and kernels for the change detection and data mining algorithms will facilitate the development of applications in many areas including defense, security, science and others. Furthermore, this research will bring the use of reconfigurable<br\/>architectural acceleration of functions on streaming data including change detection and data mining, thereby opening new avenues of research and enabling newer data-driven applications on complex datasets. Both graduate and undergraduate students (through undergraduate fellowships) are engaged in the research.

Today, only a small percentage of ships entering U.S. ports have their cargoes inspected. The purpose of this study is to develop decision support algorithms that will help us to optimally intercept illicit materials and weapons and to test the algorithms on real data arising from port-of-entry inspection. The algorithms sought will find inspection schemes that minimize total cost, including \"cost\" of false positives and false negatives. <br\/><br\/>Imagine a stream of entities arriving at a port and a decision maker having to decide how to inspect them, which to subject to further inspection and which to allow to pass through with only minimal levels of inspection. This is a complex sequential decision making problem. The ultimate goal of an inspection scheme is to classify an entity into important categories and states. In the simplest case, there are two categories (\"ok\" and \"suspicious\") and two states (\"present\" or \"absent\"). This classification can be described as involving a boolean decision function. Different binary tree representations for a boolean decision function have different inspection costs associated with them and an optimal decision tree representation is sought. Modeling sensors used to test for attributes makes the problem more realistic and brings in possible inspection errors and false positives and negatives. Extending the problem to more than two categories and more than two states also makes the problem more realistic.<br\/><br\/>The project will be carried out in collaboration between a university team and a team from the Los Alamos National Laboratory and will initially follow an approach pioneered at Los Alamos.

Yet violating them---by assuming elevated privilege, for example---makes application development so much easier on conventional operating systems that it's doubtful the principles will ever be broadly followed there. This research program investigates a new operating system design, Asbestos, that allows applications to be completely secured by third parties, such as system administrators, without help from application authors themselves. The fundamental Asbestos security primitive is interposition, whereby programs can easily interpose upon, monitor, and control any or all interactions between an application and the rest of the system. Unlike previous systems, this includes interactions with other applications as well as system services. Interposers correspond to security policies, or per-application firewalls. They can block or virtualize undesired accesses, so that legacy applications that demand inappropriately high privilege can run in a less-privileged setting. Design challenges include making system interactions easy for interposers to understand, and developing a convenient library of security policies built from interposition components. A successful Asbestos design has the potential to significantly improve the security of critical systems, even those running insecure applications.

In the area of planning under uncertainty, the Markov decision process (MDP) has emerged as a powerful and elegant framework for solving problems in a wide range of application domains such as mobile robot control, machine maintenance, gesture recognition, medical diagnosis and treatment, and policy making. For situations in which the decision maker can fully observe the intermediate state of the domain, there are many effective algorithms that can solve large problems. However, in many applications, it is unrealistic to assume that perfect state information is available. The more general, partially-observable MDP (POMDP) addresses this difficulty, but in this case the computational complexity of planning makes it hard to apply existing solution techniques to practical applications. <br\/><br\/>This project will study new ways to address the key computational bottlenecks in POMDP algorithms. To achieve this, it will (a) Identify and examine new types of belief-space structures that can be used to accelerate significantly each of the key components of POMDP solution techniques; (b) Evaluate the impact of these improvements on a wide range of exact and approximate algorithms with the goal of demonstrating exponential acceleration; (c) Integrate the new approach with previously identified methods for accelerating MDP and POMDP algorithms using search, symbolic representations, and parallelization; (d) Develop a new set of challenging test problems and benchmarks that are significantly harder than the existing toy problems and perform a rigorous evaluation and comparison of the developed techniques; and (e) Increase the interaction between the artificial intelligence community and other communities that employ POMDP solution techniques such as operations research and management sciences, and exploit the synergy that arises when the best solution techniques from these communities are brought together. <br\/><br\/>The approach is based on exploring new types of structures in the belief space that make it possible to decompose the main computational components into faster, region-based operations. A theoretical analysis of the new approach and a preliminary implementation show that it can significantly increase the efficiency of both exact and approximate algorithms and thus it can improve the scalability of POMDP algorithms and increase their applicability. The newly designed technique is particularly suitable for parallel implementation on grid computers, offering significant additional opportunities for performance gains. <br\/><br\/>The technical impact of this project involves fundamental contributions to the understanding of the complexity of planning in stochastic domains as well as the development of efficient planning algorithms that provide exponential savings in computing time. The new approach improves several computational operations that are often used as components of existing algorithms - both exact and approximate. Therefore, the benefits of the approach transfer easily to many existing solution techniques.

There are many examples of smart room systems that offer exciting infrastructures to enhance teaching, distance education, resource sharing and local group activities. Examples include the iLAND, Roomware, EasyLiving, Interactive Workspaces, Oxygen and Gaia systems for support of smart room infrastructures. These smart environments are characterized by a high concentration of single user devices, ranging from handheld devices to high-performance HDTV plasma displays, connected via heterogeneous networks such as 802.11 wireless Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet. However, most of these smart room devices include multimedia devices that can assist in creating 2D video conferencing environments, but not 3D teleimmersive environments. Examples include VRVS, a web oriented system for video conferencing and collaborative work over IP, Polycom, Netmeeting, vic and vat to broadcast audio and video over MBone IP multicast. On the other hand, outside of smart room environments, expensive immersive environments emerged, which either do not support easily tele-immersion or are complex to be connected via Internet. Examples include CAVE environment, AccessGrid, an immersive group-to-group collaboration system, TIDE, a tele-immersive virtual environment for collaborative visualization and exploration, Colliseum, a desktop tele-immersive system.<br\/><br\/>The goal of this research is to place a joint 2D and 3D tele-immersive collaboration into smart rooms, consider multicamera 2D\/3D sources in one smart room which transmit the video data over LAN and\/or WAN to other smart room(s) where the video streams are either rendered into a 3D tele-immersive video or displayed as 2D video streams in a multi-view fashion on multiple displays. The challenges of this goal are tremendous if we consider a true tele-immersive environment as follows: (1) video resolution of a captured video stream from a 3D camera is 640x480 pixels or higher, each pixel includes RGB and depth information encoded as 5 bytes per pixel resolution, and 10 frames per second. This video characteristic means to process and transmit 1.536Mbytes per frame, 15.36 Mbytes per second, 122.480 MBit per second per stream, (2) we consider ten cameras to achieve a satisfactory teleimmersive perception, i.e., 3D video streams are placed in one room in a 180 degree half-circle, which means 15.36 Mbytes or 1.22480 Gigabits per second to store and transmit in\/from\/to one smart room, and (3) all 3D streams must arrive in a synchronous manner to achieve a proper rendering into a final 3D tele-immersive video. The current multimedia protocol delivery solutions still consider (a) much smaller sizes of 2D video streams, (b) no joint 2D\/3D videos, and (c) if high volume data are to be transmitted, then often dedicated networking infrastructure are in place (e.g., in case of supercomputing applications or Virtual Reality applications). Hence, there is a strong need to understand how to organize such large volumes of time-sensitive video data in smart rooms, what algorithms and protocol functions must be part of the environment to assist in 3D multimedia delivery, management and control.<br\/><br\/>The principal investigators (PIs) propose a unified application-level broadband protocol framework for multi-camera 3D video delivery between smart rooms to reach the goal of sending 3D video streams in time-sensitive manner. This application-level broadband framework will explore the protocol design space above the augmented TCP or UDP-like multimedia-enhanced transport layer as a strong complement to efforts to change the router and transport protocol functions. The PIs will carefully look at service functions residing in the session layer and application layer using a cross-layering approach. Since the multi-camera 3D video streams are sent from a room environment and also received in a room environment, a LAN\/WAN computing and communication infrastructure will be available to host the various service functions in a distributed manner.

Partners will collaborate on a set of screen-based tasks, and the effects of shared eyegaze will be examined with and without a bi-directional voice channel and other forms of pointing such as with a mouse. The effects of these different communication modes will be compared using the grounding framework in order to discover the independent and combined contributions of speech, gaze, and other pointing methods upon interpersonal coordination on a fine timescale (100 milliseconds to seconds). The effectiveness of different screen representations of eyegaze will also be compared in different situations. Measures include performance, speed, choice of strategies, contingent behaviors, distribution of effort and initiative between partners, and learning. Tasks include searching together to locate a target (as police officers searching for a sniper or a team of ornithologists searching for a bird among trees), tracking moving targets (as security personnel tracking a suspect in a crowd within an auditorium or a pair of marine biologists tracking a swimming animal), and establishing consensus using referential communication (as doctors referring to ambiguous or hard-to-describe patterns in medical images or programmers helping each other debug software).<br\/><br\/>Much of what is known about how people accomplish searching, monitoring, and problem-solving tasks has focused on people acting alone. But in reality, people often collaborate on such tasks and need to coordinate their behavior with others. More and more often, collaboration takes place between two people at a distance, electronically mediated. In this project, a psychologist who studies visual attention, a psycholinguist who studies communication, a computer scientist who studies graphics and object recognition, and their students examine the use of shared eyegaze, or two people's ability to see where each other is looking, moment by moment. The investigators have developed the first system in which the output from two lightweight head-mounted eyetrackers is not only synchronized with speech for analysis as experimental data, but is also transmitted as a continuous stream of interpersonal cues for communication. The eyegaze of each partner is displayed on the screen of the other in the form of a gaze cursor, so that that each can tell where the other is looking, as well as whether they are both fixating the same object (mutual gaze). This project builds on the investigators' previous work on how awareness of where a partner is looking improves performance in collaborative tasks.<br\/><br\/>Understanding human coordination on a fine-grained scale is vital for supporting collaboration among people located at a distance. Spoken communication by itself can create bottlenecks for some timecritical applications; therefore, the ability of collaborators to share visual context and precise representations of what they are attending to is expected to be helpful with time-critical tasks.<br\/><br\/>Eyetracking is a promising technology for supporting collaboration. Since its inception as a tool for research, the technology has become more precise, less cumbersome, cheaper, and easier to use. With further advances, eyetracking could someday join the ranks of ubiquitous input devices like the mouse or touch screen. This research will provide scientific foundations for the use of eyetracking in computer-mediated collaboration between remotely located people. <br\/><br\/>This project will provide information on how best to deploy (and just as important, when not to deploy) shared gaze technology in mediated communication. A better understanding of the instrumental and intentional ways in which people collaborating together on tasks gaze at objects may also benefit those who cannot speak or move their hands and who might prefer to use eyetracking as a means of communicating with people or computers.<br\/><br\/>The project affords many opportunities in the interdisciplinary research and training of graduate students and undergraduates at Stony Brook, home to a racially, ethnically, and economically diverse population of talented students. This training will integrate visual attention, social dynamics, language processing and computer graphics, topics that are often pursued independently of one another.","title":"Using Shared Gaze to Coordinate Time-Critical Collaborative Tasks","awardID":"0527585","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7319","name":"HSD - DYNAMICS OF HUMAN BEHAVI"}}],"PIcoPI":["483394","508251","508252"],"PO":["564456"]},"108549":{"abstract":"This award is to support an international cooperative project which will organise and run an international workshop on the subject of applied inverse problems at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, UK, 26-30 June, 2005 (http:\/\/www.cs.ac.uk\/aip2005\/).

The requested fund will be used to support only US participants.<br\/><br\/>The field of inverse problems in the broadest sense is the study of theoretical and practical methods for recovering the properties of physical or mathematical structures from indirect measurements of derived quantities. In recent years the enormous increase in computing power has made it possible to apply the techniques of inverse problems to situations of growing complexity. Applications are very widespread in science, medicine and engineering and include, for example, a number of medical as well as other imaging techniques, location of oil and mineral deposits in the earth's substructure, creation of astrophysical images from telescope data, finding cracks and interfaces within materials, shape optimization, model identification in growth processes and, more recently, modeling in the life sciences. The goal of this meeting is to provide a forum for mathematicians and practitioners working in the theory and applications of such inverse problems and to bridge the gap between research into analytical aspects and their practical, mostly computational, applications. We expect to provide a timely and significant boost to the mathematical and also cross-disciplinary communities in the USA and elsewhere by bringing researchers up to the state of the art. Younger participants will be able to assess current opportunities on a global scale for the next phases of their research careers. The European location will give junior US participants an excellent opportunity to exchange ideas with their European (including Eastern European) counterparts. The investigators expect that this will result in new collaborations. In contrast to the traditional meeting pattern of senior invited speakers and contributed papers, the workshop format will allow a comprehensive view of the state of the art, the exploration of current problems and new applications and will encourage new collaborations, both national and international and between academe and industry.","title":"Applied Inverse Problems Workshop 2005","awardID":"0528366","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0703","name":"Division of CIVIL, MECHANICAL, & MANUFACT","abbr":"CMMI"},"pgm":{"id":"1266","name":"APPLIED MATHEMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["306467","442494"],"PO":["562265"]},"107009":{"abstract":"The proliferation of wireless applications creates an increased density of wireless devices. Information-bearing signals from these devices generate significant aggregate interference that adversely affects Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) performance. Non-data bearing radiated signals also contaminate the space of WLANs in unlicensed bands. To date, this interference problem has largely been treated in an incremental, application specific manner. Thus, there is strong motivation to thoroughly understand this interference phenomenon to improve WLAN design, and ultimately adapt WLANs to dynamically mitigate interference degradation.<br\/>This effort focuses on: the development of quantifiable interference characteristics of wireless receivers and, intentional and unintentional transmitters; the establishment of a means of understanding and characterizing interference temperature; and the use of this critical information to enhance interference and general error-modeling capabilities of network simulation tools. These objectives are achieved via a three-prong methodology: (1) theoretical modeling of interfering signals in temporal and spectral domains; (2) simulation modeling for studying the impact of interference on network performance including specific protocols, applications, and validation of interference models; (3) physical experimentation to verify and enhance theoretical and simulation results, augmenting empirical observations.<br\/>The broad impact of this research allows the technical community to better understand wireless network resource management, leading to significant economic savings and performance improvements. Another important impact is on U.S. government communications policy. Education and training of students in this field is enhanced.

Until recently, individual labs have simply imposed local homogeneity of format and procedure, and not stored lab-dependent metadata. This ad hoc system is limited, however, as crystallographers begin to cross between labs to accomplish their research objectives, and as increasing numbers and sizes of output data streams leave less time for each investigation. Local workflow must be made explicit, procedures must be formally described, and the history and assemblages of data expressed in an open, shareable way. Creation and management of complete, accessible records for each experiment is critical, as well as heterogeneity in data acquisition and management across the field. <br\/><br\/>To meet that need, this project will develop a framework of web service interfaces and data and metadata systems addressing the whole spectrum of crystallography. Project participants and collaborators will leverage existing projects, such as Reciprocal Net and Common Instrument Middleware Architecture, that address narrower issues in the problem domain.

The resulting framework will be a useful environment for crystallographic investigations and an extensible platform on which new web-based applications can be built.<br\/><br\/>The CGF project involves the classic problem of dealing with heterogeneity in data, procedures, and instruments in the crystallography application space, and another classic problem in integrating the entire data collection, transport, and curation requirements of the domain into a seamless beginning to end system.

Although the project targets specifically a few hundreds of crystallography labs worldwide, the software and methods created in it are intended to be reusable for any science moving from individual lab practices to a shared, global collaboratory system. In sciences such as high-energy physics and astronomy, the scientists have long shared single, unique, large instruments and had to create shared data management and instrument metadata.

Biological systems are the most perfect known information processing and storage devices, but very little is known about the mathematical principles of their functions and operations. Without a deeper understanding of these characteristics, many emerging technologies aimed at replicating nature's communication pathways will not achieve their full potential. This issue is of special importance for DNA and RNA-based computers, proposed for applications involving solvers of computationally hard problems and for use in \"smart drug\" systems, capable of regulating and normalizing gene expressions levels in cancerous cells. <br\/><br\/>The investigators address various aspects of error-control and constrained coding for DNA based computers and DNA storage devices, which can aid in improving the performance and reliability of the systems under consideration. The research involves analyzing mathematical properties of RNA and single-stranded DNA folding and hybridization patterns from the perspective of information theory and statistical physics, and developing novel error-correction methods for constructing DNA tile sets used in algorithmic DNA self-assembly. The study is based on classical and some novel ideas from algebraic channel coding, combinatorial optimization and design theory. Furthermore, the investigators study the problem of modeling gene regulatory networks in terms of graphical structures closely related to coding-theoretic iterative systems.","title":"Collaborative Research: Constrained and Error-Control Coding for DNA Computers","awardID":"0514875","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4096","name":"COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["518457"],"PO":["348215"]},"107801":{"abstract":"This research investigates the protection of computation integrity and enhancement of data privacy for applications executed on distributed computing platforms that utilize the spare processor cycles of computers connected to the Internet.

Even as there is a general consensus that<br\/>opto-electronic (O-E) regeneration within the network is unavoidable at national and continental network scales, there is a push to limit such O-E regeneration. Optical transport and switching provide the advantage of transparency to protocols, bit-rates, modulation formats, etc., thus enabling a smoother evolution path for an infrastructure that will undoubtedly grow from its initially deployed framework. Transparency introduces a design issue that is not well studied or understood at this point, namely, the strong interaction between the physical and higher layers.

Typical applications consist of several cooperating processes, many of which are multithreaded. The possibility of subtle interactions between threads and between processes leads to significant challenges in the design, implementation, and testing of such systems. Currently, formal verification and validation methods provide a high degree of confidence of the correctness and reliability of software systems. Model checking, a state-space exploration methodology, is usually applied at the design phase of the software life cycle to verify that preliminary high-level design specifications conform to their requirements. Source code (program) analysis, on the other hand, is used to check for correctness of implementation once it is realized from the design specifications. The current practice of validating a design and its implementation in isolation makes it necessary to employ rigorous testing analysis to empirically ensure that the implementation satisfies the design specification. <br\/><br\/>The principal investigators (PIs) claim that tighter integration of the design and implementation phase of the software development process is necessary to bridge the inherent gap between specification and its corresponding implementation. The PIs propose to achieve this via a formal framework that allows design models to contain embedded partial implementations as components; these models are then formally analyzed to ensure that global requirements are satisfied. The framework, therefore, provides flexibility to incrementally develop and ensure correctness of the design and the corresponding implementation. Realization of the above objective requires consolidation and expansion of traditional formal verification techniques by bringing together the power of model checking, program analysis and constraint solving.","title":"CSR--SMA: Software Verification Using Plug and Play Components","awardID":"0509340","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["467171","499317"],"PO":["301532"]},"107845":{"abstract":"Mosse-Wu<br\/><br\/>Time-critical applications in embedded systems environments often have stringent quality of service (QoS) <br\/>and timing requirements that need to be met to ensure proper operation and dependability, even in the <br\/>presence of failures and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

Yet, despite the fundamental importance of this infrastructure, today's networks are surprisingly fragile and increasingly difficult to configure, control, and maintain. Using a clean-slate approach, the research team will explore a number of fundamental questions related to network control and management. The focus of the research agenda is on IP (layer-3) networks, though the principal investigators (PIs) intend to create networking primitives and services that apply equally well to other technologies, such as layer-2 networks (e.g., Ethernet networks). The starting point for the work is a small set of principles, guiding the control of the network: network-wide views, network-level objectives, and direct control. These principles lead the PIs to a refactoring of network functionality into four components---the data, discovery, dissemination, and decision planes. Via this architecture, which the PIs term the 4D approach to network control and management, the team intends to create, prototype, and demonstrate breakthrough mechanisms that will dramatically simplify and strengthen data networking.<br\/><br\/>INTELLECTUAL IMPACT: The proposed research will address fundamental questions that are key to improving IP control and management: How to go from networks that blend decision logic with specific protocols and mechanisms to an architecture that abstracts and isolates the decision logic and admits a range of efficient implementations? How to go from networks that consist of numerous uncoordinated, error-prone mechanisms, to ones where the low-level mechanisms are driven in a consistent manner by network-level objectives? How to go from networks where people set parameters (twist knobs), hoping to coax the system to reach a desired state, to one where network designers can directly express controls that automatically steer the system toward the desired state? How to go from networks where human administrators leverage network-wide views and box-level capabilities at slow timescales in decision-support systems, to one where the network itself leverages this information in real time?<br\/><br\/>BROADER IMPACT: The proposed research seeks to produce fundamental knowledge that will advance the state-of-the-art in large-scale network architecture, control and management. It intends to lay the groundwork for data networks (in academic campuses, data centers, enterprises, metro areas, backbones) that are more robust, more evolvable, and less prone to security breaches.

This system responds to attacks by dynamically and selectively quarantining hosts, services, and other networked devices. Traditional containment systems based on firewalls and individual host isolation are not adequate for containing the new generation of local-scanning, topological, metaserver and contagion worms that can spread very quickly through an enterprise. Further, these systems do not provide enterprise-wide protection of essential services during such quarantine. To address these shortcomings, a comprehensive enterprise defense framework, called SeQuEN (Service Quarantine in Enterprise Networks) is being developed, implemented and evaluated. SeQuEN automatically identifies hosts, routers and switches forquarantine based on their service interactions (\"behaviors\") instead of the physical topology of the network. Since most viruses and worms target specific services and the underlying vulnerabilities, the service-centric quarantine in SeQuEN is expected to achieve fast containment of malicious attacks. Further, SeQuEN enhances the survivability of an operational network by maintaining essential services when a network-wide quarantine is activated upon attack detection. This is achieved by partitioning the service topology into a number of quarantine zones while providing service distribution and replication. SeQuEN is also being integrated within an Attack Simulation Engine (ASE) to simulate different types of malicious code attacks, such as topological, local-scanning worms and spybots. The effectiveness of the quarantine algorithms in SeQuEN is being evaluated using network traces collected from a class-2 IP network.","title":"CT-ISG: Protection Against Malicious Attacks via Quarantine-Tolerant Service Partitioning","awardID":"0523932","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2012-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7371","name":"CYBER TRUST"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7456","name":"ITR-CYBERTRUST"}}],"PIcoPI":["553551",284605],"PO":["561889"]},"108726":{"abstract":"The PIs will develop and pilot test educational materials for teaching ethical and social issues to graduate students in information assurance and security, computer science, and information technology, the main deliverable of the project being a book having four main sections: ownership; privacy; access; and safety, reliability, and liability.

Much of this data originates from on-line sensors that act as streaming data sources, providing a continuous flow of information. As sensor sources proliferate, the flow of data becomes a deluge, and the extraction and delivery of important features in a timely and comprehensible manner becomes an ever increasingly difficult problem. More specifically, developing data mining and assimilation tools for data deluged applications faces three fundamental challenges. The amount of distributed real time streaming data is so large that even current extreme scale computing cannot effectively process it. Second, today's broadly deployable network protocols and web services do not provide the low latency and high bandwidth required by high volume real time data streams and distributed computing resources connected<br\/>over networks with high bandwidth delay products. Finally, the vast majority of today's statistical and data mining algorithms assume that all the data is co-located and at rest in files. Here, the real time data streams are distributed and the applications that consume them must be optimized to process multiple high volume real time streams. The goal is to develop novel algorithms and hardware acceleration schemes to allow real-time statistical modeling and change detection on such large-scale streaming data sets. By using Service Oriented Architecture principles, a framework for integrating high -performance change detection software services, including accelerations of commonly used kernels in statistical modeling, into a Grid messaging substrate will be developed and tested. Geographical Information System (GIS) services will be supported using<br\/>Open Geospatial Consortium standards to enable geo-referencing. <br\/><br\/>This project has the potential to have near-term and long-term impact in several important areas. In the near-term, the implementation of kernels and modules of statistical modeling and change detection algorithms will allow the end-user applications (e.g., homeland security, defense) to achieve one to two orders of magnitude improvement in performance for data driven decision support. In the longer term, the availability of toolkits and kernels for the change detection and data mining algorithms will facilitate the development of applications in many areas including defense, security, science and others.

Because of the relative newness of the DG field, there is insufficient interaction among researchers in different countries compared to what one finds in more established scientific disciplines. Most funded research around the world addresses DG challenges within the context of a single country; only a few investigations have compared results across national boundaries or tackled problems that are transnational in scope. The result of this situation is that comparative and transnational issues in DG, which are of growing importance in an increasingly networked world, are not receiving the attention they deserve. To address this gap, the team will plan, develop, and implement a four-year strategy to create opportunities and venues for international research discussions and to enable U.S. researchers and educators to advance their work through international collaboration. A small international advisory group will be named to help guide the work, connect to research sponsors in other countries, and periodically assess progress toward goals.<br\/><br\/>The proposed activities will document the development and current state of digital government research and foster relationships and intellectual engagements that will enrich it as a domain of inquiry throughout the world. The results will contribute to innovative research questions and methods, identify gaps in current knowledge that could be the focus of future research, and constitute a useful guide to individual researchers who are interested in forming relationships with international investigators who share their interests. All of these effects create an arena where research problems amenable to international treatment can be identified and investigated. This set of activities would benefit the NSF research community as well as those in other countries by building and sustaining relationships among both researchers and research sponsors around the world in an effort to catalog, compare, and where possible build synergies among funding decisions about digital government research. This project will contribute directly to the ability of US researchers and graduate students to work successfully, and in a sustained way, in international settings.

However, it is becoming increasingly important that a network not only provides good performance, but also do so in the face of a complex, uncertain, error-prone, and ever-changing environment. In today's networks, operating conditions may change as a result of user behavior (e.g., a shift in traffic to a newly popular Web site) or the underlying infrastructure (e.g., an equipment failure). In all such cases, the network and its operators must respond in a robust fashion, continuing to provide good performance despite changing conditions.<br\/><br\/>The need for \"robust\" network operation leads to a set of design considerations that the principal investigators (PIs) refer to as the \"X-ities\" (since they all end in \"ity\"): non-fragility, manageability, diagnosability, optimizability, scalability, and evolvability. Intuitively, we know that these X-ities are crucially important if we are to design and analyze robust networks and protocols. Yet, compared with standard performance metrics, these X-ities often lack theoretical foundations, quantitative frameworks, or even well-defined metrics and meaning. The goal of this project is to build a rigorous, quantitative foundation for explicitly considering the X-ities in the design and analysis of network protocols. The PIs consider a number of specific problems, broadly in the area of routing protocols, that concretely address several of the X-ities---with particular emphasis on non-fragility and manageability---and to begin to draw larger lessons from commonalities among the problems studied.<br\/><br\/>The proposed research focuses on the X-ities in the context of the routing protocols that ensure that each computer has paths through the network to send data to other computers. There are several reasons for this choice. First, routing protocols are a crucial part of the network architecture---they are the very glue that holds the disparate parts of the Internet together. Second, the X-ities of IP routing have not received significant formal attention. Third, routing protocols expose key issues of incomplete information (e.g., across networks run by different institutions) and interacting levels of control (e.g., between applications and the underlying network)---concerns that should arise in any thorough treatment of network X-ities. Finally, routing provides a compelling context in which the X-ities can be quantitatively studied. For example, we can quantify the performance trade-off between a fragile routing solution that has been optimized for narrow, well-defined operating conditions, versus a solution that will perform well of over variety of operating conditions. The contributions of the proposed research are three-fold:<br\/><br\/> A first quantitative study of X-ities: The intellectual challenges in rigorously understanding the X-ities are many. The PIs define specific metrics and develop mathematical models to quantitatively study each X-ity.<br\/><br\/> Solutions to specific problems: To make the study of the X-ities concrete, the PIs consider a set of research problems broadly in the area of routing that are of interest in their own right. <br\/><br\/> The beginnings of a foundation for studying X-ities: The PIs believe that the study of network X-ities is a crucially important area for long-term research in networking. <br\/><br\/>The X-ity research will lead to a deeper quantitative understanding of how to develop robust network architectures and protocols---technology that is playing an increasingly crucial role in our daily lives.

DESAL specifications are condition-pattern rules, and amenable to formal techniques for composition and refinement.

These protocols can achieve fast convergence to a topology change by flooding the Link State Advertisements (LSAs) declaring the change throughout the network. Each router in the network updates its routing table by doing an SPF calculation on receiving a new LSA. In order to reduce the processing load on the routers, the protocol implementations typically limit the frequency of SPF calculations thereby delaying the router's convergence to the topology change(s). Fast convergence to the topology changes is an absolute necessity in the future networks but limiting the processing load on the routers is also important for routing stability. In this proposal, we present a simple and elegant solution, called LSA Correlation, that can help achieve fast convergence to a topology change with at most two SPF calculations per change. A topology change results in the generation of several new LSAs. The simple idea is to correlate the new LSAs to identify the topology change. Once the topology change has been identified, an SPF calculation can immediately be performed. Thus, there is no need for limiting the SPF calculations for isolated topology changes and any artificial delays in the convergence process are removed.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: Both fast convergence to topology changes and routing stability are important requirements of modern networks but so far have been viewed to be at odds with each other. The proposed scheme, LSA Correlation, meets both requirements in a simple and elegant manner. LSA Correlation is simple to implement and has low time complexity. Most of the correlation processing may already be happening in the protocol implementations. Moreover, LSA Correlation is easy to deploy and can work in cooperation with other schemes to speed up the failure recovery in IP networks. Topology change identification with LSA Correlation allows large-scale topology changes to be handled differently than isolated topology changes. While fast convergence is desirable for isolated changes, it is important to limit the SPF calculations during large-scale topology changes. Finally, the subevents used in the correlation process can also be used to detect pathological situations like link flaps. The proposal also involves a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the convergence performance and processing requirements of different traditional ways to limit the SPF calculations and the proposed LSA Correlation scheme. Multiple evaluation methods (testbed experiments for smaller topologies and simulations for big topologies) will help avoid errors while real network topologies and a wide range of topology change scenarios will create realistic situations for the experiments.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The current design, implementations and deployment practices of OSPF protocol leave a lot to be desired when viewed in context of modern requirements. The dilemma between fast convergence and routing stability, rigid hub-and-spoke architecture for OSPF areas, apparent lack of scalability to very large networks, ad hoc assignment of link weights and lack of clear understanding about the relationship between the network topology and routing protocol performance are some of the factors that need careful consideration. The proposed work represents a small yet important step in overhauling the protocol for the next generation Internet. In a different context, funding of this proposal will go a long way in supporting the fledgling research in computer networks at University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee.","title":"NeTS-NBD: Fast Convergence to Topology Changes in Link State Routing Protocols","awardID":"0520064","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["367912",282116],"PO":["565090"]},"104799":{"abstract":"This project focuses on innovative methods for design-time validation of DPSS software architectures and processes by conducting research on the following synergistic research activities: (1) Conceptual framework for performance analysis, which will apply Stochastic Reward Nets (SRNs)- based analytical\/numerical techniques and simulation techniques for design-time performance analysis of DPSS system architectures.

The relays are advantaged nodes that are connected by wireless transmission to form a backbone. Transmission in the backbone may use a different frequency and have longer range than the transmissions between sensor nodes. The backbone nodes may also have larger energy supplies than the sensor nodes. A message travels through one or more sensor nodes until it reaches a relay. Then it is transmitted in the backbone until it reaches a sink (destination) node. The presence of the backbone limits traffic among the sensor nodes thereby reducing interference and prolonging battery life.<br\/><br\/>In order to design hierarchical sensor networks, it is necessary to determine how many relays are required, where they should be located, to which relay a sensor message should be directed, and what route the message should follow. This project pursues two lines of investigation to address these issues. The first develops analogies between sensor networks and the theory of electrostatics. It is applicable to networks with high sensor density. The discrete problem of routing is replaced by the continuous problem of finding a forwarding direction (vector field) at each point in the plane in such a way that a performance index (e.g., energy efficiency) is optimized. The optimal vector field can be obtained by solving a pair of partial differential equations that are analogous to Maxwell's equations in electrostatics. Making this approach distributed and applicable to hierarchical networks are important problems to be solved. The second line of investigation is concerned with the development of theory and algorithms for obtaining hierarchical sensor networks that have desirable topological properties such as k-connectivity and d-hop dominant backbones. Graph theory techniques are applied here.<br\/><br\/>The project is expected to result in algorithms for the design and operation of sensor networks that have high throughput, are energy efficient, and avoid passing messages through regions in which communication may be unreliable due to environmental conditions.

With the rapid growth of the Internet, network link speeds have become faster every year to accommodate more Internet users. Measuring and monitoring the traffic on such high-speed links has become a very challenging problem. Data streaming, first introduced in the database area, has been touted as a viable solution for this problem. Data streaming is concerned with processing a long stream of data items in one pass using a small working memory in order to answer a query regarding the stream. The challenge is to use this small memory to ``remember'' as much information pertinent to the query as possible. However, traditional data streaming algorithms, designed mostly for database applications, are not suitable for future network environments, where large volumes of data flowing through numerous high-speed links need to be monitored and controlled. This is due to the fact that these algorithms are typically designed for processing a single stream of data for a single specific type of query, and most of these algorithms cannot operate at very high link speed.<br\/><br\/>In this project, the principal investigator (PI) will investigate novel paradigms and mechanisms that allow us to perform large-scale distributed data streaming on tens of thousands of high-speed links and nodes, and aggregate, compress, and interpret these streaming results, for better measurement and monitoring of large networks. These paradigms and mechanisms will be designed to address the important network monitoring and measurement problems that traditional data streaming algorithms are not equipped to handle. Building on preliminary work, the PI plans to conduct research in the following two intellectual themes of data streaming, targeting the deficiency of existing data streaming algorithms. The first research theme is to design data streaming algorithms that can operate at the high link speeds of 40+ Gbps and still provide high accuracy, and to investigate how to achieve multiple data streaming goals in a much more resource-efficient way than simply combining individual streaming algorithms designed for those goals. The second research theme is to design distributed data streaming algorithms that can identify global patterns (e.g., globally frequent items) in aggregate traffic over many high-speed links, without merging the traffic into a single stream. These two research themes are closely related, constituting a holistic effort.<br\/><br\/>The successful exploration of the issues involved in network data streaming will have significant scientific and engineering impact. The results will provide us with much better technology for measurement, monitoring, and management of large high-speed networks, making the future Internet infrastructure more controllable, scalable, and robust. The results and methodologies developed in this project may help solve many other network data streaming problems and may have potential applications in other fields such as databases.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: This project will engage both graduate and undergraduate students, and offer them research and learning experience not only in computer networking, but also in other fields such as statistics and information theory. This will enhance their mathematical and problem solving skills, and make them more adaptive to the future challenges of networking and computing. This project will impact graduate and undergraduate curriculum through the introduction of a new course on principles of data streaming and its applications in networking and databases. This effort will help contribute to the formation of a strong relationship between research and education. The proposed research will strengthen the ongoing collaboration between the PI and the researchers at AT&T Labs--Research, IBM, and Telcordia Research Lab, facilitating application of scientific discoveries to the application domains. The results will be broadly disseminated through invited talks and tutorials at well-attended conferences, organization of focused workshops, and open-sourcing of data streaming software developed for this project, in addition to publication of papers in leading conferences and journals. The PI will also continue to work hard to actively engage underrepresented groups in research and education.","title":"NeTS-NBD: Network Data Streaming for Measurement and Monitoring of Future High-Speed Networks","awardID":"0519745","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["349186"],"PO":["402055"]},"104757":{"abstract":"The aging of baby boomers has become a social and economical challenge.

Yet, despite the fundamental importance of this infrastructure, today's networks are surprisingly fragile and increasingly difficult to configure, control, and maintain. Using a clean-slate approach, the research team will explore a number of fundamental questions related to network control and management. The focus of the research agenda is on IP (layer-3) networks, though the principal investigators (PIs) intend to create networking primitives and services that apply equally well to other technologies, such as layer-2 networks (e.g., Ethernet networks). The starting point for the work is a small set of principles, guiding the control of the network: network-wide views, network-level objectives, and direct control. These principles lead the PIs to a refactoring of network functionality into four components---the data, discovery, dissemination, and decision planes. Via this architecture, which the PIs term the 4D approach to network control and management, the team intends to create, prototype, and demonstrate breakthrough mechanisms that will dramatically simplify and strengthen data networking.<br\/><br\/>INTELLECTUAL IMPACT: The proposed research will address fundamental questions that are key to improving IP control and management: How to go from networks that blend decision logic with specific protocols and mechanisms to an architecture that abstracts and isolates the decision logic and admits a range of efficient implementations? How to go from networks that consist of numerous uncoordinated, error-prone mechanisms, to ones where the low-level mechanisms are driven in a consistent manner by network-level objectives? How to go from networks where people set parameters (twist knobs), hoping to coax the system to reach a desired state, to one where network designers can directly express controls that automatically steer the system toward the desired state? How to go from networks where human administrators leverage network-wide views and box-level capabilities at slow timescales in decision-support systems, to one where the network itself leverages this information in real time?<br\/><br\/>BROADER IMPACT: The proposed research seeks to produce fundamental knowledge that will advance the state-of-the-art in large-scale network architecture, control and management. It intends to lay the groundwork for data networks (in academic campuses, data centers, enterprises, metro areas, backbones) that are more robust, more evolvable, and less prone to security breaches.

The proposal's research objective is to extend the passivity preserving balanced truncation method to account for the statistical variations of system elements. In<br\/>an attempt to reduce the error over the frequency range of interest, the PI's earlier work on spectrally-weighted balanced truncation can also be combined with the proposed variational technique to increase the accuracy of the proposed method across the frequency range of interest. The proposed activity will extend the capabilities of the model-order reduction of LTI systems using balanced truncation in several<br\/>significant directions, such as guaranteeing passivity and accounting for the statistical variation of the system's elements. Similar to conventional balanced truncation methods, the proposed algorithm provide<br\/>a provable error-bound for the reduced-order system. Integrating the proposed variational balanced truncation method with circuit-level simulation algorithms will provide circuit and system designers a<br\/>powerful and efficient analytical tool to simulate and optimize large circuits orders of magnitude faster than the Monte-carlo simulation, while retaining the accuracy.

The problem is that broadband providers currently are struggling to develop business and service models in which they can recover the significant costs that arise as capacity expands and bandwidth hungry applications (such as peer-to-peer) consume network resources but fail to generate additional revenue. Without viable financial models, providers are motivated to suppress the emergence of non-revenue generating applications and are discouraged from investing in upgrading access network facilities that carry general Internet traffic.<br\/><br\/>All other broadband stakeholders -- including component and equipment makers, providers of content and application services, end-users and entire sectors of the economy such as education, government and health care -- would benefit from a rapid enhancement of residential broadband. However, network owners must make the bulk of the investment in upgrades even though they realize little return on the benefits that accrue to the other stakeholders. This potentially slows, or stops, the otherwise beneficial upgrading of broadband networks.<br\/><br\/>Broadband providers are thus uniquely positioned to powerfully influence the technological and economic evolution of the global Internet. Yet, the forces that shape this evolution are poorly understood. There is currently very little network research focused on 1) collecting data about broadband access networks or 2) working to ensure that the problems facing broadband network owners are addressed in ways compatible with the architectural values embodied in the Internet's original design. This project proposes to do both. Specifically the proposed research includes the following components:<br\/> Systematic, multi-resolution collection of data and network traffic from broadband access networks<br\/> Analysis of access network traffic with a focus on the architectural implications of traffic and technological trends for the interfaces between consumers, broadband providers, and the general Internet.<br\/> Development of a model that captures the complex dependencies between the aggregation behavior of network traffic, broadband provider cost recovery approaches, and the traffic properties that matter to end users and their applications.<br\/> Development of network architectures that support new business models for broadband networks that facilitate cost recovery and encourage investment in upgrading access network facilities that carry general Internet traffic.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit of this work is that it will provide a coherent picture of the technical and economic forces that are shaping residential broadband access. This will inform and help align the technology and economic research in the networking space. Broadband research must be informed by economic and technical realities if it is to be relevant -- both the technical and economic research communities run the risk of developing clever but irrelevant innovations, theories, and models without an appreciation of the trends and constraints shaping broadband. This work will provide a framework, as well as real data and analytic and simulation results, to inform and shape this process.<br\/><br\/>The broader impact of this work is that all broadband stakeholders would benefit if their interests were aligned to encourage, rather than suppress, innovation in broadband applications, services, and equipment. Major sectors, including health care, education, and government itself, would benefit from continued growth and innovation in broadband. Yet currently these and all stakeholders are captive to the decisions of broadband access providers - risking developments in broadband access networks that are architecturally undesirable or significantly delayed from the overall perspective.

Especially the time-series nature of such location traces poses novel privacy challenges that have not been addressed by more general data privacy mechanisms.

This limitation prevents ordinary users from protecting themselves from untrustworthy applications, because it is difficult for a user to create a new, more restricted environment in which to run questionable applications. It also presents software designers with an uncomfortable choice: they may either run as an ordinary user and put themselves at risk, or they may run as the super-user and put the entire system at risk. This problem has afflicted the technical community for decades and now affects the public on the web and in grid computing. <br\/><br\/>The concept of dynamic identities attacks this problem. In an operating system with dynamic identities, any user may create sub-identities at runtime without interacting with an administrator. Single users may perform self-defense by using dynamic identities to run untrusted programs. Dynamic identities also simplify the administration of distributed systems: accounts may be created on the fly according to local or global admission policies. This research will evaluate this concept by implementing it and using the implementation to explore the tradeoffs within an existing open source operating system. Preliminary work will investigate interactions between applications and the operating system.

Based on preliminary experience, it is expected that simulation turnaround will be reduced by several orders of magnitude, while achieving high accuracy and confidence in the simulation results.To estimate performance, SimFlex systematically selects a large number of short sampling units from a program execution. SimFlex performs detailed cycle-accurate measurement only within each sampling unit. SimFlex provides a collection of complementary techniques, including checkpointing, to rapidly generate the architectural and microarchitectural state necessary to initialize the cycle-accurate models before each sampled measurement. SimFlex uses statistical sampling theory to determine the minimally sized sample necessary to achieve simulation results at a desired degree of accuracy. Overall, only an exceedingly small fraction of the complete execution is simulated in detail. Preliminary investigation of the SimFlex framework in the context of an out-of-order superscalar uniprocessor (e.g., Intel Pentium 4) has resulted in a simulator that can estimate performance for SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks with a worst-case error of 2.4% and an average error of 0.6% relative to full-benchmark simulation by measuring a sample of only 50 million instructions per benchmark. In contrast, full-benchmark simulations require simulating up to trillions of instructions. The project,will explore and evaluate the effectiveness of sampling simulation of large-scale multiprocessor systems. A successful outcome of this research will permit, for the first time, simulating the execution of realistic workloads on large-scale (e.g., 64-1024 nodes) system sizes. The SimFlex framework will be evaluated for large-scale system simulation in the context of a cycle-accurate distributed shared-memory multiprocessor simulator.

This decoupling promises on-demand resource access for the consumers, and promotes diversity of supply and economies of scale among providers-thus increasing flexibility and reducing cost. This old but powerful idea underlies research on grids, virtualization, utilities, and overlay networks. However, its practical realization has been hindered by high participation costs for providers and consumers. Consumers struggle to acquire, configure, and manage remote resources and to adapt applications, while providers must adapt local system configurations to enable remote access. Two distinct threads of computer systems research seem poised to overcome this stalemate. Service oriented architectures provide flexible and scalable management interfaces and infrastructure, while virtual machine technology can turn any computer into a secure user-configurable resource. The combination of these threads enables a fundamental new model for distributed computing based on remote management and dynamic reconfiguration of virtualized resources. The challenge (and opportunity) to be addressed in this project: to bring together service-oriented grid and virtual machine technologies to enable robust, scalable, and secure on-demand access to distributed resources-and to construct the abstractions, interface, policies, and algorithms that applications need to function in a dynamic, virtualized world.<br\/><br\/>To this end, the Virtual Playgrounds project will address three primary challenges: <br\/>1. Virtualization. Building on emerging technologies for virtual machines (VM), on-demand clustering, and service-oriented architectures.<br\/>2. Isolation. Building on these core virtualization mechanisms and on state-of-the-art security infrastructure, the project will investigate mechanisms to express, monitor, and enforce contractual arrangements among consumers and providers, encompassing service quality and security assurances.<br\/>3. Dynamic adaptation. The project will investigate approaches to dynamic resource management in the new context of virtual playgrounds, including mechanisms to disseminate information about resource availability and needs, match producers and consumers, and monitor and audit resource status and flow. The project will have a significant positive impact on communities building distributed computing systems in support of research and education, and on the users of those systems. The project will reduce costs and improve return on investments in cyberinfrastructure, and remove key barriers to sharing resources across organizational boundaries. The project will also deepen ties between academic researchers and national labs, provide research-training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and increase student exposure to advanced computing environments.","title":"Collaborative Research:CSR: AES: Virtual Playgrounds: Making Virtual Distributed Computing Real","awardID":"0509408","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["553906"],"PO":["493916"]},"104825":{"abstract":"Embedded computing systems are everywhere and they control a great deal of important<br\/>infrastructure: communication, medical, utilities, etc. Embedded computing systems must be designed not just to perform a given function but to do it in real time, consume limited amounts of power, etc. Today's tools don't adequately help the programmers of embedded computers to design programs that work properly in all these senses: function, performance, and power consumption. Today, many programmers must simply write a program and run it on the embedded computer or a simulator; this approach takes too much time. As a result, many embedded programs aren't adequately analyzed and tested. This project is developing new methods for embedded system design that use models of both the programs and the computers they run on to create successively more accurate versions of the program. Previous research has developed simple models. The premise of the work is that several levels of modeling are required to design efficient and correct embedded software. In the early stages, less-accurate models are necessary to efficiently explore the design space. As design progresses, more detailed models are required.

The configuration space of a hybrid system is represented as an algebraic variety and its constituent systems as the irreducible components of this variety.

However, it is becoming increasingly important that a network not only provides good performance, but also do so in the face of a complex, uncertain, error-prone, and ever-changing environment. In today's networks, operating conditions may change as a result of user behavior (e.g., a shift in traffic to a newly popular Web site) or the underlying infrastructure (e.g., an equipment failure). In all such cases, the network and its operators must respond in a robust fashion, continuing to provide good performance despite changing conditions.<br\/><br\/>The need for \"robust\" network operation leads to a set of design considerations that the principal investigators (PIs) refer to as the \"X-ities\" (since they all end in \"ity\"): non-fragility, manageability, diagnosability, optimizability, scalability, and evolvability. Intuitively, we know that these X-ities are crucially important if we are to design and analyze robust networks and protocols. Yet, compared with standard performance metrics, these X-ities often lack theoretical foundations, quantitative frameworks, or even well-defined metrics and meaning. The goal of this project is to build a rigorous, quantitative foundation for explicitly considering the X-ities in the design and analysis of network protocols. The PIs consider a number of specific problems, broadly in the area of routing protocols, that concretely address several of the X-ities---with particular emphasis on non-fragility and manageability---and to begin to draw larger lessons from commonalities among the problems studied.<br\/><br\/>The proposed research focuses on the X-ities in the context of the routing protocols that ensure that each computer has paths through the network to send data to other computers. There are several reasons for this choice. First, routing protocols are a crucial part of the network architecture---they are the very glue that holds the disparate parts of the Internet together. Second, the X-ities of IP routing have not received significant formal attention. Third, routing protocols expose key issues of incomplete information (e.g., across networks run by different institutions) and interacting levels of control (e.g., between applications and the underlying network)---concerns that should arise in any thorough treatment of network X-ities. Finally, routing provides a compelling context in which the X-ities can be quantitatively studied. For example, we can quantify the performance trade-off between a fragile routing solution that has been optimized for narrow, well-defined operating conditions, versus a solution that will perform well of over variety of operating conditions. The contributions of the proposed research are three-fold:<br\/><br\/> A first quantitative study of X-ities: The intellectual challenges in rigorously understanding the X-ities are many. The PIs define specific metrics and develop mathematical models to quantitatively study each X-ity.<br\/><br\/> Solutions to specific problems: To make the study of the X-ities concrete, the PIs consider a set of research problems broadly in the area of routing that are of interest in their own right. <br\/><br\/> The beginnings of a foundation for studying X-ities: The PIs believe that the study of network X-ities is a crucially important area for long-term research in networking. <br\/><br\/>The X-ity research will lead to a deeper quantitative understanding of how to develop robust network architectures and protocols---technology that is playing an increasingly crucial role in our daily lives.

While fault-tolerant computing is a mature area of research, automatically designing reliable systems out of unreliable components has proven to be a challenging task. Since a practical solution to synthesizing in an automated manner, nano-scale designs that are inherently fault-tolerant has yet to be found, theoretical bounds may offer a good insight into the achievable limits of error-resilience and required minimum redundancy (or extra logic) needed. This research is intended to fill this gap and is poised to have broader impact on possible novel modeling, design and system architecture concepts involved in silicon nano-electronics and beyond (SNB). One can envision applicability of the proposed modeling techniques to atomic scale DNA-based switches. The combination of the properties of nucleic acid with those of the metal ions can lead to chemically or physically activated switches that can be combined to achieve certain functionalities or to perform relatively complex Boolean functions. Since such switches are not perfect and redundancy use is mandatory for achieving reliable global switching behavior, determining a priori theoretical bounds for the necessary redundancy is of chief practical interest. Potential applications of these structures are in molecular electronics that might be used in human body-implanted sensors and actuators or non-invasive drug delivery systems.","title":"SGER: Analysis of Fault-Tolerant Nanoscale Designs","awardID":"0542644","effectiveDate":"2005-09-15","expirationDate":"2007-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["554462"],"PO":["562984"]},"110524":{"abstract":"Confidence in Computer Architecture Modeling and Simulation<br\/>Abstract<br\/><br\/>The work addresses the statistical underpinnings of sampling-based simulation of computer architectures, with the aim of providing quantitative measures of confidence of simulation data.

In the exclusive use model, a piece of spectrum is managed exclusively by the owner or licensee, who can lease the spectrum to others. In the commons model the spectrum can be used by anyone provided that they comply with an accepted protocol or standard (as in unlicensed bands).

Unfortunately, the wealth of knowledge developed to date in the area of performance assurances in embedded<br\/>systems has been confined to a somewhat restrictive application domain where detailed knowledge is assumed of both the available resource capacity in the system and the resource requirements of individual tasks. These restrictions prevent many previous research results from being applied to a wider scope of mainstream applications and services where QoS guarantees are required, yet load and resource models are unavailable. This research seeks a solution to the problem of providing performance guarantees in the absence of detailed load and resource knowledge. The goal is to establish that fine-grained guarantees are achievable with real-time system performance even in the absence of fine-grained models of system load and resource capacity. <br\/><br\/>This is approached through new foundations for performance guarantees in embedded real-time systems operating under uncertainty. The research centers on a new calculus aimed to counter fundamental limitations on robustness and scalability in current approaches for performance guarantees. There are two main elements: <br\/><br\/>1) A theory for robust schedulability analysis based on feasible regions: A feasible region is a set of aggregate system states in which all timing constraints are guaranteed to be met. This research is developing methods for deriving multi-dimensional feasible regions in a continuous state space, where the dimensions represent aggregate measurable quantities such as the overall utilization of different system resources. Maintaining a system within feasible region boundaries guarantees temporal correctness based on aggregates only. These mechanisms will be more scalable and suitable for systems where detailed information about the load and resources is unavailable. <br\/><br\/>2) Middleware components that enforce conformance of a run-time system to its feasible region. The theoretical framework being developed is incorporated into a middleware framework based on control theory, which executes run-time performance monitoring and feedback control mechanisms to ensure that system state converges to a feasible region. This condition is enforced using admission control and QoS adaptation.<br\/><br\/>These two elements maintain guarantees on real-time behavior by linking applications with the middleware, specifying desired QoS guarantees, and leveraging run-time feasible region enforcement mechanisms to provide correct temporal behavior in in open real-time systems. This increases the scope of embedded computing from predominantly closed custom-designed systems to large distributed open systems composed of commercial off-the-shelf components such as web servers, mainstream operating systems, and standard protocols such as TCP\/IP, where accurate load and resource knowledge is unavailable. High impact is expected through the ability to achieve predictable behavior in many important systems ranging from large Web server farms and Internet routers to ubiquitous computing systems, and smart spaces.","title":"A Paradigm for Scalable Open Real-Time Computing Under Uncertainty","awardID":"0553420","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2801","name":"EMBEDDED & HYBRID SYSTEMS(EHS)"}}],"PIcoPI":["553633"],"PO":["561889"]},"101406":{"abstract":"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in a novel question-answering technology.

During Phase I, Language Computer Corporation (LCC) developed a system that decomposes high-level questions into low-level, fact-seeking questions. Some of these questions, however, turn out to be nonsensical. In Phase II, the firm proposes to submit all of the decomposed questions to a knowledge-based system, which will eliminate questions that are inconsistent with tacit knowledge. All of the questions that survive filtering will be passed back for processing by the question-answering system. (2) Aligning domain ontologies with a large reference ontology.

This alignment will permit deeper expansion of query concepts, because it will allow domain-independent concepts to be augmented with domain-dependent content. (3) Formal evaluation of semantic relations. The foundation of the question-answering system is semantic relations extracted from queries and documents.

This decoupling promises on-demand resource access for the consumers, and promotes diversity of supply and economies of scale among providers-thus increasing flexibility and reducing cost. This old but powerful idea underlies research on grids, virtualization, utilities, and overlay networks. However, its practical realization has been hindered by high participation costs for providers and consumers. Consumers struggle to acquire, configure, and manage remote resources and to adapt applications, while providers must adapt local system configurations to enable remote access. Two distinct threads of computer systems research seem poised to overcome this stalemate. Service oriented architectures provide flexible and scalable management interfaces and infrastructure, while virtual machine technology can turn any computer into a secure user-configurable resource. The combination of these threads enables a fundamental new model for distributed computing based on remote management and dynamic reconfiguration of virtualized resources. The challenge (and opportunity) to be addressed in this project: to bring together service-oriented grid and virtual machine technologies to enable robust, scalable, and secure on-demand access to distributed resources-and to construct the abstractions, interface, policies, and algorithms that applications need to function in a dynamic, virtualized world.<br\/><br\/>To this end, the Virtual Playgrounds project will address three primary challenges: <br\/>1. Virtualization. Building on emerging technologies for virtual machines (VM), on-demand clustering, and service-oriented architectures.<br\/>2. Isolation.

The project will have a significant positive impact on communities building distributed computing systems in support of research and education, and on the users of those systems. The project will reduce costs and improve return on investments in cyberinfrastructure, and remove key barriers to sharing resources across organizational boundaries. The project will also deepen ties between academic researchers and national labs, provide research-training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and increase student exposure to advanced computing environments.","title":"Collaborative Research: CSR: AES: Virtual Playgrounds: Making Virtual Distributed Computing Real","awardID":"0509466","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["554547",276755,"526412"],"PO":["493916"]},"104838":{"abstract":"Existing approaches to implementing multimedia encoding and decoding algorithms on embedded systems have several drawbacks. First, multimedia algorithms are designed without explicitly taking resource constraints into account. Second, current embedded systems often assume \"worst-case\" resource utilization for the design and implementation of compression techniques, thereby neglecting the fact that multimedia algorithms require time-varying resources. Third, the algorithms and their implementation are not jointly optimized, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Finally, existing adaptive systems for multimedia are, at best, reactive, i.e., they adapt their resources to past data inputs, instead of modeling and predicting future resource requirements and planning accordingly. <br\/><br\/>In this project, the abovementioned limitations are addressed to improve the efficiency of multimedia applications on embedded systems. Specifically, this research investigates dynamic resource planning techniques that can jointly optimize the complexity of the multimedia algorithms and the resource utilization, while meeting a given system constraint. This forms the basis for proactive resource management by using feed-forward control mechanisms like stochastic modeling, learning and forecasting. Finally, rate- and complexity-scalable compression schemes are necessary to enable optimized adaptation to available resources.

Gao (Virginia Tech)<br\/><br\/>Abstract: Global optimization problems are widespread in the mathematical modelling of real world systems for a very broad range of applications. Due to the nonconvexity of the cost functions, many problems in global optimization are NP-hard. Traditional direct methods and local optimization procedures can not guarantee the identification of the global minima. On the other hand, duality theory and methods may provide potentially important influence on the solutions and algorithms for global optimization problems.<br\/>The primary goal of this project is to develop a general canonical primal-dual method and its associated triality theory in global optimization. The project focuses on a general constrained global optimization problem, which arises directly from numerical discretization of a large class of nonconvex variational problems in engineering mechanics. The secondary goal is to advance the development of certain powerful primal-dual algorithms with concrete applications to nonconvex mechanics.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit of the proposed work includes <br\/>(1) a potentially powerful canonical dual transformation which can be used to formulate perfect dual problems (with zero duality gap); <br\/>(2) an interesting triality theory which can serve as an optimality criterion to identify both global minima and local extrema of nonconvex function. <br\/>Each of these aspects presents its own challenges. Formulation of perfect dual problems requires nonstandard methods, as the traditional duality theory in convex analysis may lead to a so-called duality gap when the primal problem is nonconvex. Global optimality criterion for nonconvex\/nonsmooth functions over feasible spaces will need special mathematical techniques due to the loss of convexity and smoothness.<br\/><br\/>The broader impacts of this project are potentially very great as the proposed problem arises in multi-disciplinary fields of global optimization, nonconvex\/nonsmooth analysis, engineering mechanics, modern materials, mathematical physics, and scientific computation. The general methodology of canonical dual transformation and the beautiful triality theory will bridge the existing gaps among these fields. The broad distribution of software and publications (including a set of three volumes of Handbook of Duality Theory in Engineering Science to be published by Springer) will benefit practitioners and scientists across engineering, mathematics, physics, and computational science. Two international conferences on global optimization and nonconvex mechanics will be organized in 2005 and 2006, respectively. These conferences will open new trends in modern analysis, optimization, and engineering science. Furthermore, they will stimulate young faculty and students to venture into this rich domain of research. The proposed work will be carried out by an interdisciplinary team at Virginia Tech which includes both undergraduate and graduate students from math and engineering departments. <br\/>The completion of this project will lay a ground work in global optimization, nonconvex mechanics, and computational science.","title":"Primal-Dual Method and Algorithm for large Scale Computation with Applications in Engineering Mechancis","awardID":"0514768","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":["522055"],"PO":["564898"]},"106928":{"abstract":"The focus of the project is on the design and development of cross-layer solutions to improve the data gathering performance of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in the presence of correlated sensing information.

When analyzing the fault-handling machinery of storage systems, there are two conflicting goals: thoroughness and efficiency. The SAFE project accomplishes both goals by injecting faults using \"gray box\" knowledge of the systems in order to selectively exercise their fault-handling machinery. By applying this technique, the SAFE project can assess the level of robustness in current storage technology, including commercial file systems and distributed storage systems. When constructing more reliable storage systems, a further goal is to ensure that the improvements can be deployed in practice. Thus, one approach taken in this project is to transparently insert a failure-handling layer between the file system and the disk it manages; in this way, fault-resilient storage systems can be deployed without cooperation from either developers or disk manufacturers. The sum of these techniques for failure-analysis and failure-handling is a new generation of more robust and reliable storage systems.<br\/><br\/>Broader significance: Storage systems are becoming increasingly central to everyone's \"digital\" lives. Hence, techniques that improve the robustness of file storage, ensuring that valuable data is not lost or altered, are of paramount importance.

Yet, despite the fundamental importance of this infrastructure, today's networks are surprisingly fragile and increasingly difficult to configure, control, and maintain. Using a clean-slate approach, the research team will explore a number of fundamental questions related to network control and management. The focus of the research agenda is on IP (layer-3) networks, though the principal investigators (PIs) intend to create networking primitives and services that apply equally well to other technologies, such as layer-2 networks (e.g., Ethernet networks). The starting point for the work is a small set of principles, guiding the control of the network: network-wide views, network-level objectives, and direct control. These principles lead the PIs to a refactoring of network functionality into four components---the data, discovery, dissemination, and decision planes. Via this architecture, which the PIs term the 4D approach to network control and management, the team intends to create, prototype, and demonstrate breakthrough mechanisms that will dramatically simplify and strengthen data networking.<br\/><br\/>INTELLECTUAL IMPACT: The proposed research will address fundamental questions that are key to improving IP control and management: How to go from networks that blend decision logic with specific protocols and mechanisms to an architecture that abstracts and isolates the decision logic and admits a range of efficient implementations? How to go from networks that consist of numerous uncoordinated, error-prone mechanisms, to ones where the low-level mechanisms are driven in a consistent manner by network-level objectives? How to go from networks where people set parameters (twist knobs), hoping to coax the system to reach a desired state, to one where network designers can directly express controls that automatically steer the system toward the desired state? How to go from networks where human administrators leverage network-wide views and box-level capabilities at slow timescales in decision-support systems, to one where the network itself leverages this information in real time?<br\/><br\/>BROADER IMPACT: The proposed research seeks to produce fundamental knowledge that will advance the state-of-the-art in large-scale network architecture, control and management. It intends to lay the groundwork for data networks (in academic campuses, data centers, enterprises, metro areas, backbones) that are more robust, more evolvable, and less prone to security breaches.

Raghav<br\/><br\/><br\/>Although a large research effort has been directed toward improving Anti\/Counter-Terrorism (ACT) authorities' internal efficiency and interoperability, only a handful of studies have looked at citizens as an integral part of ACT services. The proposed research takes a citizen-centric perspective and is geared toward enhanced e-government services that help citizens prepare and protect themselves from terrorist attacks. This study proposes to survey citizens to understand Internet-based ACT government service use. Specifically, three categories of usage behaviors or behavioral intentions (i.e., get news, provide public leads, and follow directions) will be analyzed using an analytical framework that decomposes the behaviors\/intentions into three, interlinked cognitive\/decision processes; risk perception, channel choice decision, and source choice decision. Building on previous human behavior and innovation diffusion research in the MIS field, the study will examine the impacts of various social, technological, and personal factors on the cognitive\/decision processes. The study will administer a questionnaire survey to two groups: systematically sampled US citizens and ACT service subscribers of a partnering organization (an Internet-based ACT service provider- Terrorism Research Center (www.terrorism.com)). The<br\/>resulting model will be able to provide answers to such questions as \"why are some citizens indifferent to ACT services?\", \"how can the US government improve citizen-to-government ACT information flow using e-Gov facilities?\", \"why do some citizens prefer ACT services provided through traditional channels to those provided through the Internet?\", and \"why do some citizens prefer Internet-based ACT services provided by a non-government organization to those provided by a government authority?\" In addition to the timeliness of this research activity, an innovative aspect is that the research model will take into account an inherent duality: an e-gov service is perceived in some instances as an instrument of service and in others as an instrument of compliance. The model will also examine citizens' fear, privacy, and trust in relation to the role of the ACT service provider: protector, controller, or both.<br\/><br\/>This project will benefit ACT authorities by providing more and better public intelligence and benefit citizens by helping understand the key to well thought, higher quality ACT e-Gov<br\/>services.

The principle goal of this project is to develop a deeper understanding of the fundamental performance, scaling properties, and tradeoffs and includes two main research thrusts. The first is focused on constructing analytical and empirical models that accurately characterize the functional relationship between performance metrics (e.g., end-to-end delay) and significant factors. Analytical end-to-end delay and packet discard models are being developed that account for interactions among the traffic arrival process, wireless channels, error control mechanisms, and mobility-induced path failures. The empirical models are based on two modeling approaches: (1) response surface methodology and regression analysis and (2) the class of Levenberg-Marquardt multilayer perceptron neural networks. In the second research thrust, we are using the above models to explore several scaling and performance properties, including which system configuration(s) lead to optimal, robust, scalable, or satisfiable performance response(s) over specified regions of interests. Using the predictive empirical models, adaptive cross-layer feedback-based mechanisms are being designed for transport and QoS-sensitive routing strategies.

We begin our investigation by focusing on one example.<br\/><br\/>The Packed Exponential Connections (PEC) network is a grid-based network with connectivity and routing results that are competitive with hypercubic networks. The prior results are all empirical, since the structure of the network has only been understood through an indirect existence proof. In this research we will explore the first theoretical understanding of a PEC network. The preliminary work will be extended to incorporate the fundamental problems of routing and broadcasting; this will lead to broader question of the algorithmic utility of the PEC network, and exponential interconnection networks in general.<br\/><br\/>While the PEC network is deterministic an exponential interconnection networks can also be defined probabilistically. Such a network can and will be studied empirically and analytically; in any event, the PEC network gives a benchmark for comparisons.<br\/><br\/>The broader impact of this work can be seen both in the benefits of the research and the benefits for education. There is a need for a better understanding of networks in areas like ad hoc networks. In these areas the emphasis has been on simple issues like connectivity and hierarchical flow of information; we propose to study the properties of sparse networks that are better suited to algorithmic processing. The first step in this direction is the PEC networks. The educational benefits will be primarily in the involvement of students; a Ph.D. candidate is budgeted. This aspect of broader impact is particularly true for an SGER proposal, since it is always harder for a student to find support to work on high-risk subjects. It is important to train researchers to take risks.

This focus, however, ignores critical and fundamental skills necessary for this population to utilize such devices. Difficulties with memory, new learning and executive functions (i.e., initiation, planning) prevent potential device users from getting out the door and even turning on a device or tool. The PI's data suggests that most trips are doomed not because of on-route travel problems, but rather due to lack of trip preparation and failure to successfully start a trip by getting out the door and to the first bus or taxi stop. In this project, the PI will take on this problem of \"the first hundred yards\" under the hypothesis is that it is possible to (a) design effective trip preparation systems that can support the cognitively impaired population in terms of community access, and (b) avoid the common problem of device abandonment for this population. The research approach is based on the following assumptions: that a successful design process for a travel system must be linked to a personal requirements engineering process that captures the goals and skills of individuals; that the design process must be composite, taking into account both computer-based components and people; and that the problem must be solved in context, which implies drawing in both members of a safety-net and community service-providers already in place at many destinations to assist a traveler. The project builds on the PI's fifteen years of experience with the brain injury population, as well as five years of experience delivering computer-based assistive technology. It has at its foundation a comprehensive study of the desires and needs of the population in terms of community access. A two-phase evaluation approach, which has proven highly successful in prior work on assistive technology and the brain-injury population, will be used to assess the outcomes of this research.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: More than a million adults in the United States are diagnosed annually with cognitive impairments due to neurological disease or trauma, and it is estimated that there are currently up to 16 million Americans living with chronic brain disorders. Incidence rates for severe traumatic brain injury are higher than those for spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, and muscular dystrophy combined. Unfortunately, cognitive disability from trauma and other conditions represents a \"silent epidemic\" in that research and technological resources are disproportionately distributed to help those who are blind, deaf or physically disabled, conditions which are easily observable. This project will attempt to redress this imbalance by affording individuals living with cognitive impairment due to acquired brain injury the ability to access public community resources using various modes of transportation, including walking, special-needs vans, and fixed-route public transport.","title":"The First Hundred Yards: Navigation Planning Systems for People with Cognitive Impairments","awardID":"0512071","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6845","name":"HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6846","name":"UNIVERSAL ACCESS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["449118","449119"],"PO":["565227"]},"107062":{"abstract":"Chemical plumes can arise from accidental spills, or deliberate terrorist attacks.

It is misled by pockets of high chemical density that are not sources. Anemotaxis moves upwind whenever an above-threshold level of chemical is detected. It is misled by wind sources that are not chemical sources.

Fluxotaxis is tailored to be computationally efficient for a set of microprocessors running in parallel. Each robot is a grid point in a computational Fluid dynamics mesh\/lattice. The robots act as a distributed sensing network, performing flow analyses and making navigational decisions based on these analyses.

Platelets are micron-size cells - smaller than red blood cells - and when activated they become adhesive for other activated platelets and they adhere to the vessel wall. Their strong interaction with nano-size proteins at the sub-endothelium matrix activates and reshapes them from passively traveling discoids to active spiny spheres. The length and time scales characterizing such interactions as well as platelet-blood flow interactions span several orders of magnitude.<br\/><br\/>We propose a multiscale modeling methodology with focus on flow-modulated phenomena such as platelet adhesion and aggregation at the micron-scale, and including nanoscale effects representing the main protein interactions. We will develop an integrated approach by coupling multiscale representations of blood flow, ranging from a quasi 1D transient flow in compliant vessels at the largest scale, to unsteady 3D flows in curved and flexing vessels at the mm range, to multi micron-scale thrombus formation at a fissure in the lumen of such a vessel with an atherosclerotic plaque, to changes over short times (seconds and minutes) in the behavior of platelet structure, receptors and bonds in a developing thrombus-wall interaction. To this end, we will develop a new mesoscopic numerical method that bridges the gap between atomistic phenomena and large-scale phenomena to seamlessly connect length scales from 10 nm to a few mm. The new simulation approach will be validated systematically against experiments of varying biological and computational complexity.<br\/><br\/>We also propose to establish a virtual center for multiscale modeling in order to provide modelers and experimentalists with quantitative information about molecular and cellullar processes that can be incorporated into simplified models.

The system can be easily moved between conference rooms or offices, and can be connected with mono or stereo projectors. The effort enables scientists to significantly enhance the utility, usability, and collaborative potential for scientific visualization in research, education, collaboration, and interaction with the general public. The resulting tools will be deployed, utilized, and integrated into research and education at five Louisiana campuses which are already linked together by numerous academic collaborations. The central elements of these platforms, the \"viz tangibles,\" are small, modular interaction devices, typically embedded with different interactors, indicators, and networked microcontrollers. So far, three basic and three specialized viz tangibles, interconnected physically and functionally following a simple grammar, have been implemented. One device loads and saves online information, applications, and parameters, which are referenced with RFID-tagged cards. Another device includes a rebindable \"parameter wheel,\" that supports the manipulation of continuous discrete parameters. A third device provides VCR-like button controls that may drive a variety of interactions. Together, these devices provide core operations for a wide variety of visualization and simulation applications, with functionality resembling the GUI \"file\" and \"edit\" menus, but optimized for simple, collaborative, semi-immersive, divided-attention use.

The use of covert sensing of physiological indices could minimize<br\/>or even eliminate the use of countermeasures by the subject, while providing the ability to measure the dynamical changes of heart rate (\"heart rate variability\" or HRV) that reflect the activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which is measurably altered during mental provocation. Miniaturized microwave-based systems also have potential medical applications, such as non-contact monitoring of vital signs at a bedside, for burn victims and for research, where the discomfort associated with electrocardiographic (ECG) leads may interfere with a study, as might occur in sleep apnea research when a subject's discomfort alters normal sleep habits. Previous work, has demonstrated the efficacy of microwave-Doppler sensing to measure respiration, pulse rate and eye blinks. The case of \"uncooperative\" subjects has received little attention. In order for a microwave-based system to be useful in realistic settings, several issues related to uncooperative subjects must be addressed concerning signal and noise variability arising from: (1) sudden, unpredictable subject movements, (2) variation of signal with location on the thorax and the angle of incidence, and (3) fluctuation of the distance between the sensor and the subject with time. Remote detection serves a number of medical purposes, including in burn patients which standard sensors of heart variability are in themselves stressful.","title":"Remote Detection of Psychological Stress [JHAPL_FY05_090]","awardID":"0515869","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"H186","name":"Defense Intelligence Agency"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"T377","name":"DIA-MASINT CONSORTIUM PROJECT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"T768","name":"DIA -MASINT RESEARCH PROJECT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"T885","name":"DIA-MASINT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"V918","name":"DIA-SOW"}}],"PIcoPI":[280052,280053],"PO":["565136"]},"107030":{"abstract":"As the Internet becomes an essential part of our everyday computing and communication infrastructure, it has also grown to be a complex distributed system that is hard to characterize. There have been numerous studies on network topology, IP-reachability, and routing dynamics to analyze end-to-end packet forwarding performance. However, there is very little systematic investigation into the influence of other packet transformations that happen along the path, e.g., firewalls, packet filtering, and quality-of-service mapping. Among these, firewalls are ubiquitous as they become indispensable security defense mechanisms used in business and enterprise networks. Just as router mis-configurations can lead to unpredictable routing problems, misconfigured firewalls may fail to enforce the intended security policies, or may incur high packet processing delay. Unfortunately, firewall configuration for a large, complex enterprise network is a demanding and error-prone task, even for experienced administrators. Firewalls can be distributed in many parts of the network or across layers (IP-layer filtering versus application-layer solutions) to cooperatively achieve a global, network-wide policy. As distributed firewall rules are concatenated, it becomes extremely difficult to predict the resulting end-to-end behavior and whether it meets the higher-level security policy.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual merit: In this project, the principal investigators (PIs) propose to develop a unified framework for policy-checking, optimization, and auto-reconfiguration of distributed firewalls. This research will provide novel analysis, design techniques, and tools to better protect our critical information infrastructures from attacks. The PIs will explore providing consistent and efficient security protection for an enterprise that may have geographically distributed business networks served by different local Internet Service Providers. They adopt an inter-disciplinary technical approach that leverages multi-way communications among the three PIs with expertise in networking, security, and programming languages and compilers areas to design an integrated solution. In particular, the PIs propose a systematic treatment of the problem by casting it as a static program analysis question, exploiting well-established and rigorous techniques from the area of programming languages and compilers. The PIs will pursue the following closely related tasks:<br\/><br\/>Policy Validation for Security: The PIs first classify all possible policy anomalies (including both inconsistency and inefficiency) in firewall configurations. They will model firewalls as finite-state transition systems and apply symbolic model checking techniques on these finite-state representations to detect both intra-firewall and inter-firewall policy anomalies. The policy validation method consists of two phases. First, they perform control-flow analysis and identify all possible flow paths. Second, they perform data-flow analysis and check for anomalies on every path. Identifying most intra-firewall and inter-firewall anomalies can be accomplished in one traversal. The processing results of each path are further used to identify inter-path misconfigurations.<br\/><br\/>Policy Optimization for Performance: In a typical firewall setting, a packet is compared against a list of rules sequentially until the packet matches a rule. Firewalls with complex rule sets can cause significant delays on network traffic and therefore becomes a bottleneck (especially in high-speed networks) and an attractive target for DoS attacks. Therefore, it is important to optimize packet filtering to provide network Quality of Service (QoS) requirement. In addition, the total number of rules configured and the order of rules also play major roles in the load and efficiency of a firewall. The PIs approach this problem by representing filtering rules as binary decision diagrams (BDDs) and generating \"optimal filter rule sets\" from the internal BDD representation. They also apply dataflow analysis to hoist same or similar rules from different paths to a common location to reduce traffic. They will leverage the underlying network topology, routing, and traffic distribution information in the optimization step to improve the efficiency of firewall checking, which enhances packet-forwarding performance. The key advantage of this approach is the ability to pro-actively prevent vulnerabilities in firewalls since static analysis can be applied before the actual deployment of firewalls.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The proposed research efforts will help system and network administrators to configure networked systems more securely and efficiently. The educational component, which is directed at both undergraduate and graduate students, complements the research activities. Research results will be incorporated into new and existing courses.

These activities will require integrated networks of instruments, sensors, robots, and vehicles to cooperate forming a \"digital ocean.\" Underwater communication via propagating acoustic signals holds the best promise for reliable and general purpose wireless communications in the ocean. Significant advances have been made in recent years to establish physical layer point-to-point links in many types of ocean environments. Yet, the development of higher layer techniques suitable for the challenging characteristics of the ocean environment remains largely unexplored territory. Networking the \"digital ocean\" via underwater acoustic communications remains one of the formidable technical obstacles to the a fully networked ocean. Challenges to be overcome by underwater acoustic modem and network designers include: severely limited range-dependent bandwidth and attenuation, extensive time-varying multipath propagation, and low speed of sound propagation in water resulting in long propagation delays. For sensor network deployment, these features imply that asynchronous and adaptive networking must be considered, typical medium access control will not be feasible, deterministic algorithms may not be feasible due to the stochastic nature of underwater networks, and link quality prediction and estimation will be paramount to delivering the desired quality of service. Finally, distance-dependent bandwidth implies that everything from capacity analysis to medium access control must be redeveloped under these new constraints. Terrestrial sensor networks are typically distinguished by high node density, large amounts of potentially correlated sensed data, stringent limitations on system resources, and multiple sources of uncertainty. Underwater sensor networks have even stronger limitations. To achieve the goals of an undersea sensor network, the PIs propose to study the following: network topology optimization and estimation, channel & energy-aware routing, delay\/disruption tolerant underwater networking, cross-layer designs which integrate underwater channel characteristics, impact of the underwater acoustic channel on scaling laws and fundamental limits, experimental validation of system concepts for underwater acoustic networking","title":"Collaborative Research: NeTS-NOSS: Networking the Digital Ocean","awardID":"0520324","effectiveDate":"2005-09-15","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"06","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES             ","abbr":"GEO"},"div":{"id":"0604","name":"Division of OCEAN SCIENCES","abbr":"OCE"},"pgm":{"id":"1680","name":"OCEAN TECH & INTERDISC COORDIN"}},{"dir":{"id":"06","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES             ","abbr":"GEO"},"div":{"id":"0604","name":"Division of OCEAN SCIENCES","abbr":"OCE"},"pgm":{"id":"7314","name":"ITR FOR NATIONAL PRIORITIES"}}],"PIcoPI":["515828","467823"],"PO":["564464"]},"112190":{"abstract":"This project develops a service oriented middleware to facilitate the execution of secure fault tolerant multiparty computations in distributed collaborative applications over peer-to-peer networks.

While the necessary bandwidth is achievable under a variety of data representations and network conditions, past attempts have been largely defeated by network latency. Building on his past work in musical accompaniment systems that developed a core technology of score following, musical prediction, and audio synthesis, the PI will explore in this project a completely new approach to DMP, feasible using ordinary \"household\" fast network connections, in which the remotely played musical parts are synthesized by predicting the musical evolution. Within the context of non-improvisatory music, these predictions are based both on past history during the current performance (received with latency), and past performances of the same musical piece.<br\/><br\/>The simplest version of a system implementing this approach would connect a duo of musicians playing MIDI-controlled instruments by transmitting only event times over the network and basing predictions on these. This basic idea can be extended in several important ways. For instance, the approach can be applied to arbitrary acoustic (non-electronic) instruments by performing real-time score-following on the audio signal and transmitting only the event times across the network; on the other end, these event times can drive a synthesis engine that reconstructs an audio recording of the remote part using phase-vocoding. The proposed methods extend naturally to small collections of instruments, and possibly even to an entire orchestra.<br\/><br\/>The principal challenge facing the PI in this research is to develop a modeling and prediction framework in which DMP is feasible in a network environment with no special latency guarantee.

Noting that different connections may have different service-level agreements (SLAs) on their availabilities, the objective is to select a proper protection mechanism (e.g., dedicated or shared or no protection at all) to cost-effectively provision a connection request to meet its SLA.<br\/><br\/>Second, the project will investigate survivable multi-path provisioning. Specifically, new protection and provisioning strategies will be designed to exploit emerging inverse-multiplexing technologies in networks such as Next-Generation SONET\/SDH. By splitting up and provisioning a connection over multiple paths through inverse multiplexing, one can achieve degraded service even in case of (multiple) failures (vs. no service at all as in present mode of operation of networks).<br\/><br\/>Third, the project will investigate the problem of reprovisioning protection bandwidth. In particular, the investigators will study backup reprovisioning to handle multiple concurrent failures, which means that a new failure occurs before a previous failure is repaired. Such backup reprovisioning strategies can lead to more efficient use of the bandwidth resources that are needed to protect against network failures.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: The approaches and results of this project can have much broader applicability, e.g., bandwidth provisioning in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and other networks. Besides enhancing the national educational infrastructure through student training, this project is expected to have a strong influence on the telecom industry, with which the PIs have a close working relationship.

Nevertheless, communication systems based on digital signal processing inevitably require certain high-performance analog circuit blocks, and the accuracy required of these blocks will increase as communication standards continue to evolve. Unfortunately, in perpetuating Moore's Law integrated circuit (IC) technology trade-offs are necessary that favor digital circuitry over analog circuitry; high-performance analog circuits are increasingly difficult to implement as IC technology is scaled. Thus, there is a fundamental disconnect between the requirements of present and future high-performance communications and the evolution of the semiconductor electronics industry.<br\/><br\/>This research addresses an important aspect of this problem by developing digital signal processing enhancement techniques that enable high-resolution, high-bandwidth digital-to-analog converters (DACs) which are critical components in wideband communication transmitters. Presently, such DACs are limited by component mismatches inevitably introduced during IC fabrication and by other non-ideal circuit effects that introduce nonlinear transient distortion. The goal of the research is to develop digital signal processing algorithms that mitigate these problems. The research consists of four tightly-coupled components: 1) the development of an ultra-efficient dynamic element matching (DEM) technique for eliminating harmonic distortion caused by component mismatches, 2) the development of an adaptive noise cancellation technique that augments the DEM to reduce SNR degradation caused by component mismatches, 3) the development of an interpolation technique to mitigate the nonlinear transient problem, and 4) the development of a CMOS integrated circuit prototype with record-setting performance as a proof-of-principle and to provide feedback with which to guide the theoretical work.","title":"Signal Processing Enhanced DACs for Wideband Communication Systems","awardID":"0515286","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["560228"],"PO":["564898"]},"95367":{"abstract":"This project aims to build a foundational library of primitives for calculating statistics on time series at online or near-online speeds.

Fast (online) response is desirable in many applications (e.g., remote aiming of a telescope to a fast-moving object of interest).

The project starts with well-documented cases of real-world software engineering failure, because research shows that many such failures can be traced to deviations from accepted professional and ethical norms. A case study, presented as a sterile document, may not provoke the level of ethical engagement needed to make a pedagogic impression, so this project will convert a carefully selected set of cases into active, branching \"decision spaces\" that can be navigated online by graduate students. As they \"walk\" the decision space, they participate vicariously in the case study, make and undo decisions, and experience the good and bad consequences of their actions (or inaction), including their effect on stakeholders. The project creates four different types of \"decision spaces\" using four different types of tools. Here the goal is to determine which combinations produce the better balance of production effort and pedagogic value. To determine whether this balance has been achieved, investigators will perform a meticulous time-and-task accounting that will allow them to state the approximate cost, in staff-hours, to deliver one hour of interactive content under each of four models. This cost can then be balanced against judgments of pedagogic value developed within the project's assessment procedures.

Software engineering failures have momentous social consequences: invasions of privacy, battlefield mistakes, theft of intellectual property, transportation deaths and delays, spyware, power outages, medical misdiagnosis and mistreatment, identity theft, election fraud, false arrest and imprisonment, denials of service, loss of data, flawed credit reports and a host of other nasty consequences.

Traditionally, it has been successfully applied to strategic planning problems where solution time is not an issue. The innovation of this research is to extend the applicability to operational and tactical decision making where rapid solution times are necessary. A key characteristic of problems arising in real-time environments is that consecutive instances typically differ only slightly, indicating a need for technology that supports incremental problem solving. Further, the algorithms developed will be designed to exploit the computational power and data delivery capabilities of the emerging cyberinfrastructure. The applicability of the research will be demonstrated in three specific application areas: supply chain management, airline disruption recovery, and radiation therapy treatment planning.<br\/><br\/>The successful development of real-time integer programming technology has huge potential for addressing difficult operational problems. Its tactical use may dramatically improve airlines' ability to recover from disruptions, significantly enhance the quality of radiation therapy for cancer patients or provide huge economic benefits by increasing the agility of supply chains. Another high-impact aspect of the research will be its pioneering use of cyberinfrastructure. This proposal will open up new possibilities for the operations research community to exploit the computational, data storage, and communication resources that are now becoming available for use in real-time decision making.

Using computed conformal structures, new geometry<br\/>representation and analysis tools can be developed, which will pave<br\/>the road for advances in multiple fronts of science and<br\/>engineering. The work proposed herein will especially explore these<br\/>potentials in computer graphics and visualization.

The recent rapid deployment of inexpensive 802.11 hardware and other personal wireless technology (cordless phones, bluetooth, etc.) is quickly changing the wireless landscape. The resulting dense deployment of wireless networking equipment in areas such as neighborhoods and shopping malls, differ from campus-like deployments in several important ways: (1) they are unplanned and, therefore, result in highly variable densities of wireless nodes, and (2) they are unmanaged and, therefore, configuring, troubleshooting, etc. cannot be performed efficiently. This project uses the term chaotic deployments or chaotic networks to refer to collections of wireless networks with these two properties.<br\/>As wireless networks become more common and more densely packed, more of these chaotic deployments will suffer from serious contention, poor performance, and security problems. This will seriously hinder the deployment and use of these infrastructures, negating many of the benefits offered by wireless networks. This project explores solving this problem by making chaotic networks self-managing. For example, this includes developing techniques that automate both the configuration and runtime management of wireless devices. This project is exploring these issues for both current wireless systems, such as 802.11, and future radio technologies, such as cognitive radios, which require more complex configuration.

By deploying a sensor network along such areas (using humans or flying drones) one can maintain a global view of key attributes of the environment.

This approach, distinct from concurrency theory and the theory of computation, represents a paradigm shift that changes our understanding of what is computation and how it is modeled. Interaction machines extend Turing machines with interaction to capture the behavior of concurrent systems, promising to bridge these two fields.<br\/><br\/>In the November 2004 issue of \"Information and Computation\", the Principal Investigator and others presented persistent Turing machines (PTMs), an extension to the Turing machine model that is both interactive and persistent. A PTM is a nondeterministic 3-tape Turing machine with a read-only input tape, a read\/write work tape, and a write-only output tape. A PTM performs persistent computations in the sense that a notion of ``memory'' (work-tape contents) is maintained from one interaction (computation) step to the next. PTM computations are shown to be more expressive than Turing machine computations. As an analogue of the Church-Turing Thesis, it is hypothesized that PTMs capture the intuitive notion of sequential interactive computation; that is, any sequential interactive computation can be performed by a persistent Turing machine. <br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit.<br\/>PTMs capture sequential interaction, which is a limited form of concurrency.

For each associated PTM complexity class, we plan to identify sample interactive computations that characterize the class and determine if any of the identified computations are complete for their class.

Intellectual Impact<br\/>Research is proposed on two Areas of Interest in NSF Solicitation 05-501: Development of a broad<br\/>and general collection of quantum algorithms; Quantum simulation of quantum systems. Specific<br\/>topics:<br\/>Hidden subgroup problems: The status of the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem (HSP)<br\/>is one of the most fundamental open problems in quantum algorithms. In particular, the graph<br\/>automorphism problem may be formulated as a hidden subgroup problem over the symmetric<br\/>group S n . The abelian case can be effectively computed with a quantum computer by repetition<br\/>of coset state preparation and Fourier sampling. The natural generalization of this method to<br\/>nonabelian groups is commonly referred to as the standard method for the nonabelian HSP. The<br\/>performance of this algorithm depends upon properties of the irreducible complex representations<br\/>of the group. However in most cases they do not yet yield useful algorithms. Research is proposed<br\/>on improving these methods as well as determining in which cases they are bound for failure and<br\/>other methods are necessitated.<br\/>Algorithmic cooling: Algorithmic cooling is an inescapable component of quantum algorithms:<br\/>for example, we can even view fault-tolerant computing as moving heat (random errors) out of the<br\/>computation registers. These issues are particularly pressing in the context of liquid-state NMR<br\/>quantum computing as well as ion trap quantum computing, and we have studied them (especially<br\/>in the NMR context) in the past, obtaining results that are nearly best-possible for closed-system<br\/>cooling. These results reveal, however, that closed-system cooling cannot be powerful enough to<br\/>turn warm systems into large-scale quantum computers. We are therefore turning to the study<br\/>of open-system algorithmic cooling. This requires new algorithmic techniques. Also, since open<br\/>systems are more sensitive to decoherence than closed systems, more careful modeling of these<br\/>effects will be required.<br\/>Fault-tolerant Quantum Comptutation: Decoherence is the major obstacle to the experimen-<br\/>tal realization of quantum computers. Over the last year there have been two significant break-<br\/>throughs in the ability to carry out fault-tolerant quantum computation in the presence of deco-<br\/>herence. The main idea in both cases is the use of uniquely quantum features to limit the exposure<br\/>of data to decoherence. We plan to explore these ideas further to a) improve the overhead in the<br\/>number of ancillas discarded and therefore the total number of qubits required b) improve the<br\/>threshold and decrease computational overhead for more realistic error-models<br\/>2. Broader Impact<br\/>Societal impact: Even if quantum computers are a distant reality, encryption of data today so that<br\/>it cannot be decrypted at a future time, depends upon the development of cryptosystems resilient<br\/>to attacks by quantum computers. This in turn demands an understanding of what problems are<br\/>and are not tractable on quantum computers, a core topic of the proposed research.<br\/>Educational impact: Ideas from quantum computation and quantum information can poten-<br\/>tially have a major impact on how basic quantum mechanics is taught (quite apart from teaching<br\/>quantum computation, which is also part of our efforts). We propose to create course material to<br\/>make this happen.","title":"QnTM: Collaborative Research: Quantum Algorithms","awardID":"0524828","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1708","name":"QuBIC"}}],"PIcoPI":["550549"],"PO":["565223"]},"107772":{"abstract":"Yau-Kim abstract<br\/><br\/>Collaborative Research: CT-T: Security and Survivability of Real-time Systems with MANETs<br\/>Real-time systems with mobile ad hoc networks (mRTS) have potential applications in many areas, including scientific research, healthcare, disaster recovery, environment control, military and homeland security, and industrial process control.

It also lays the foundations for the query languages and frameworks useful in supporting automated web service discovery and composition in a scalable context. In addition to the study of formal models, the research develops various software tools that will be available via the project's Web site (http:\/\/www.cs.ucsb.edu\/~su\/NSF0415195\/). The resulting formalism will improve the quality of deployed web services since properties of their behavior can be verified, and foster web service adoption and reuse since compositions of services could be synthesized and analyzed. This is a collaborative university (Jianwen Su, University of California, Santa Barbara)\/industry (Rick Hull, Lucent) research project. This will facilitate transferring the theoretical results to practice and finding realistic applications to test the techniques. The project exposes students and academic researchers to industry needs and industry practitioners to university research through a plan of mutual visits.","title":"Collaborative Research: Data Management Tools for Web Services","awardID":"0415195","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}}],"PIcoPI":["389214","389215"],"PO":["563727"]},"107574":{"abstract":"Many real-world problems involve optimizing over decisions that take discrete set of values. Examples of such problems include routing vehicles in a logistics network, VLSI circuit design, gene sequencing, portfolio selection, wireless network design and many others. Large-scale instances of such problems are extremely difficult to solve and require both theoretical and computational advancements in solution approaches. This project is aimed at development of theory and computational enhancements for Functional Annealing (FA) algorithm to solve large-scale discrete optimization problems. FA is a stochastic local search algorithm that performs local improvement while randomly perturbing the objective function in each iteration. The random perturbation allows the algorithm to escape local optima and can also be used to guide the stochastic search in the solution space by creating bias. The algorithm can be used with any local improvement strategy. These features make the algorithm computationally more attractive but significantly harder to analyze theoretically compared to well-known algorithms such as Simulated Annealing. The proposed work involves investigating asymptotic and finite time convergence properties of FA. It also seeks to identify computational enhancements of the algorithm by finding the optimal choice of perturbation, and incorporating learning schemes in the generation of bias in the perturbation. As part of the computational investigation, FA algorithms will be developed for two important problem classes. The first class is the network design problems arising in logistics applications. The PI will work with an industry partner in package shipment industry to develop and test the algorithms on real-world instances of network design problems. The second class is the unconstrained quadratic binary programming problems. This class models a large number of combinatorial optimization problems.<br\/><br\/>If successful, the proposed work will lead to development of efficient algorithms for very large instances of discrete optimization problems with provable convergence guarantees. Theoretical results from this work would improve the understanding of other stochastic local search methods as well. The work on network design problems could lead to new algorithms and software tools for planning problems in logistics. The computational testing for unconstrained quadratic binary programming problems could generate a powerful solution tool for many researchers and practitioners, given its broad applicability. Software developed during the research would be available as part of the Metaheuristic Cyber Infrastructure for Operations Research to give easy access to researchers and practitioners.","title":"Functional Annealing for Discrete Optimization Problems","awardID":"0522552","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"7368","name":"SCI TESTBEDS"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0703","name":"Division of CIVIL, MECHANICAL, & MANUFACT","abbr":"CMMI"},"pgm":{"id":"5514","name":"OPERATIONS RESEARCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0707","name":"Division of INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION & PARTNE","abbr":"IIP"},"pgm":{"id":"1504","name":"GRANT OPP FOR ACAD LIA W\/INDUS"}}],"PIcoPI":[284111],"PO":["565139"]},"119795":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>0524010<br\/>William Winsborough<br\/>George Mason University<br\/>Lead Collaborative with 0524036, 0524132, 0524035<br\/><br\/><br\/>Protecting confidential information in dynamic, distributed environments whose participants have heterogeneous trust relationships is an important and difficult challenge.

Efficiency of the algorithms and underlying representations is the key to effectively using such databases. This research addresses efficiency issues from the perspective of applications in spatial and metric databases involving queries such as nearest neighbor finding. The goal is to speed up operations that arise in applications in computer graphics, geographic information systems (GIS), and computer vision that make use of large databases. The applications that are considered include the fast computation of point cloud models as well the efficient representation of data such as terrains via triangulations of the underlying surface. The implementation of such data in a distributed environment is also studied.<br\/><br\/>In this project we are investigating three related topics. First is computing k nearest neighbor joins for point cloud models in computer graphics applications. In particular, rather than computing the k nearest neighbors for each data point, we reuse the set of neighbors of the points for which we have already performed the task. The approach is to exploit the concept of locality of a given object q (e.g., a point, a block containing a query point, or an arbitrary object) in a search hierarchy defined to be the set of blocks which could contain the k nearest neighbors of q. We investigate this in the context of moving object databases where the query object is in motion while the remaining objects in the database are stationary (e.g., gas stations, buildings, restaurants, etc.). The goal is to determine the region that must be searched to find the k nearest neighbors of an object or objects whose motion is restricted to a particular region of space. We are devising efficient (possibly optimal) methods to compute the locality based on our incremental nearest neighbor algorithm. We explore computation of the Hausdorff distance that is used in computer vision and computer graphics. <br\/>Second is an investigation of distributed spatial indexes for applications in P2P networks. The approach is to apply our incremental nearest neighbor algorithm in such an environment. We also extend CHORD method to provide key-based lookup service in a distributed spatial index in conjunction with a larger variety of spatial indexes. Additionally, we study the relationship of the CAN key-based lookup service to a quadtree. <br\/>Third is in indexing triangulations. Triangulations are usually represented using a variant of an adjacency structure that stores the topological relations between the triangles. Finding the actual triangle that contains the query point requires the imposition of an index on the collection of triangles. We are devising a mathematical model that helps evaluate the efficiency of using a bucketing method based on the PM2 quadtree to store the triangulation. The model uses geometric probability.","title":"Foundations of Geometric and Metric Databases","awardID":"0515241","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7228","name":"DATA AND APPLICATIONS SECURITY"}}],"PIcoPI":["551003"],"PO":["565157"]},"107024":{"abstract":"This project will focus on extending the existing Emulab based testbed with 80 additional PCs equipped with Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRPs), as well as creation of an infrastructure called Emulab-Lite to support many small-scale testbeds.

The propagation of such spikes along neuronal fibers is slow, resulting in noticeable delays. Usually, the existence of delays implies that something is not functioning well or disorganized, just think of traffic delays. However, there is a growing empirical evidence that propagation delays in the brain are maintained with a millisecond precision, that is, they are there on purpose. <br\/><br\/>The existence of delays is still ignored by the neuroscience community because their significance in neural computations is unclear. In addition, delays complicate modeling because systems with delays are infinite-dimensional from a purely mathematical point of view. <br\/><br\/>Dr. Izhikevich's experimental and computational studies of biological neurons and networks with delays show that infinite dimensionality is not a nuisance, but an immense advantage that results in an unprecedented, possibly unlimited information capacity of such systems. In particular, the systems can exhibit a novel nonlinear phenomenon -- polychronization -- generation of reproducible time-locked but not synchronous spiking patterns with millisecond precision. The number of such patterns far exceeds the number of neurons in the network, and could be even greater than the number of connections in the network. <br\/><br\/>Dr. Izhikevich proposes to explore novel computational properties resulted from the infinite dimensionality of spiking networks with delays.

Yet, despite the fundamental importance of this infrastructure, today's networks are surprisingly fragile and increasingly difficult to configure, control, and maintain. Using a clean-slate approach, the research team will explore a number of fundamental questions related to network control and management. The focus of the research agenda is on IP (layer-3) networks, though the principal investigators (PIs) intend to create networking primitives and services that apply equally well to other technologies, such as layer-2 networks (e.g., Ethernet networks). The starting point for the work is a small set of principles, guiding the control of the network: network-wide views, network-level objectives, and direct control. These principles lead the PIs to a refactoring of network functionality into four components---the data, discovery, dissemination, and decision planes. Via this architecture, which the PIs term the 4D approach to network control and management, the team intends to create, prototype, and demonstrate breakthrough mechanisms that will dramatically simplify and strengthen data networking.<br\/><br\/>INTELLECTUAL IMPACT: The proposed research will address fundamental questions that are key to improving IP control and management: How to go from networks that blend decision logic with specific protocols and mechanisms to an architecture that abstracts and isolates the decision logic and admits a range of efficient implementations? How to go from networks that consist of numerous uncoordinated, error-prone mechanisms, to ones where the low-level mechanisms are driven in a consistent manner by network-level objectives? How to go from networks where people set parameters (twist knobs), hoping to coax the system to reach a desired state, to one where network designers can directly express controls that automatically steer the system toward the desired state? How to go from networks where human administrators leverage network-wide views and box-level capabilities at slow timescales in decision-support systems, to one where the network itself leverages this information in real time?<br\/><br\/>BROADER IMPACT: The proposed research seeks to produce fundamental knowledge that will advance the state-of-the-art in large-scale network architecture, control and management. It intends to lay the groundwork for data networks (in academic campuses, data centers, enterprises, metro areas, backbones) that are more robust, more evolvable, and less prone to security breaches.

These wires are the bottleneck of circuit and system performance, as transistors are now so fast that it takes more time to transmit signals than to compute them. Core problems in physical design include the shaping and placement of both circuit components (\"modules\") and the wires connecting them. As the size and complexity of integrated circuits continue to grow exponentially with Moore's Law to 10 to 100 million modules, so does the difficulty in achieving designs that meet required performance targets under various constraints, such as constraints on the maximum power or temperature. Sophisticated computer-aided design (CAD) software plays a vital role in VLSI design. The systematic procedures or \"algorithms\" from which this software is derived are at the center of efforts to improve the quality and efficiency of circuit designs. To be useful in practice, these algorithms must be scalable; i.e., their runtime increases at a modest rate, e.g., linearly, as the design size increases. Mathematical formulations have been used extensively for physical design problems, but most of them assume either that the modules are evenly distributed over the circuit or that they follow a pre-specified density profile. The focus of this research is on the development of mathematical models and techniques to support the development of practical algorithms for the more general physical-design setting in which no pre-specified density profile is available. Such a formulation is a much better reflection of the underlying physical design problem, as, for example, the temperature distribution will not be known a priori.<br\/><br\/>The broader impact of a high-quality scalable algorithm for placement optimization under generalized density inequalities would be considerable. Improved design algorithms produce more powerful circuitry. A scalable high-quality solver with physically accurate constraint modeling allows designers to integrate diverse circuit elements in complex ways. The resulting increase in computing power ultimately translates into new products, new markets, and new science. Ultimately, the vast size and complexity of nano-scale design problems can realistically be approached only by generic, scalable algorithms yet to be developed. The successful formulation of a truly scalable methodology for physically realistic VLSI designs can be expected to have lasting and far-reaching impact on future design paradigms.","title":"MSPA-MCS: Scalable Optimization Algorithms for VLSI Circuit Physical Design","awardID":"0528583","effectiveDate":"2005-09-15","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2878","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CCF"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4710","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["306467","558485","558485","492272"],"PO":["562984"]},"107025":{"abstract":"This project addresses the scalability of wireless networks when steerable phase array antennas are used by a subset of the network and builds on earlier work resulting in a modified MAC layer for such steerable antennas. This earlier found that limited use of that steerability was needed; rather than change antenna configuration on a packet-by-packet basis, antenna configurations are designed to target a slowly changing set of nodes. That work begged the question of how those slowly changing sets of nodes should be formed. This project uses spatial diversity to improve the efficiency of the physical layer and proposes a network layer that enables efficient spatial reuse at the physical layer. This includes dynamically defining the topology, or connectedness, of the network as well as the routing, or use of available connections. This problem is challenging because phase array antennas not only change the direction of RF signal, they also vary the strength of that signal. This project includes development and use of a research network combining fixed and mobile nodes using a combination of steerable and fixes antennas. This platform will use SoftMAC, a low cost software defined radio, to deploy prototype systems for in-field experimentation. Example applications for this project include city- and emergency service networks, and the researchers will be working with local Police and Fire departments to understand, model and analyze usage scenarios for these highly dynamic networks.

The initial work casts VA within the framework of reinforcement learning (RL) as this approach has demonstrated previous successes for other networking problems. RL researchers study algorithms for learning high reward strategies for one or more agents based on reward signals received while interacting with an environment. For VA, the environment corresponds to a specific computer network; the reward signal provides positive reward for activity that is detrimental to a network and negative reward for activity that is detected as malicious (hence cannot harm the network). The strategy discovered by RL gives a method for one or more agents to attack the network without being detected. In this proposal, the focus is on using RL techniques to discover VA in Peer-to-Peer networks.

Studies by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) show that about 74 TWh\/yr of electricity (which is approximately $6 billion per year) is consumed by the Internet in the USA alone, of which 24 TWh\/yr or 32% could be saved with full use of power management on desktop computers, currently the most common of edge devices on the Internet. Unfortunately, due to limits of existing protocols and architectures, networked desktop computers typically remain powered-up during frequent and often lengthy periods of idleness. As network devices, they are prevented from operating in an energy-efficient manner due to their need to respond to network transactions of various types without warning. The NSF is currently funding projects to investigate energy-use reduction in first-level LAN switches, server clusters, and supercomputers, but severely lacking is research to reduce energy consumption of the largest portion of Internet energy consumers, the edge devices.<br\/><br\/>The principal investigators'(PIs) approach to addressing this challenge is to investigate and exploit a synergistic set of novel research concepts for protocol and subsystem infrastructure, and algorithms for effectively controlling them based on traffic and system constraints, so that desktop and other edge devices can be put to sleep during periods of relative idleness while network connectivity is maintained by a low-power hardware proxy integrated into the system. Moreover, the PIs' approach also promises to provide additional increases in energy efficiency by reducing consumption of network-related resources during active periods where graceful degradation of performance is acceptable, in effect trading off speed for energy. In addition to desktop computers, this approach will lead to similar solutions for a wide variety of emerging wired and wireless edge devices such as television set-top boxes, network appliances, remote cameras, etc.<br\/><br\/>The novel concepts in the proposed approach include: (1) protocol proxying in the network interface of a desktop computer and\/or within a first-level LAN switch to reduce minor use of system resources of the edge device and thus allow system power management to be fully exploited; (2) \"smart\" wake-up methods to allow power-managed devices to be awoken transparently and only when needed by existing applications and protocols, along with new power-management notification semantics for future network applications; (3) adaptive link rate in Ethernet to trade-off performance (or QoS) for energy efficiency by dynamically operating links at varying data rates (e.g., 1 or 10 Gb\/s only when needed, and otherwise at 10 or 100 Mb\/s); and (4) architectures for fixed or reconfigurable levels of staged hardware functionality to realize energy-efficient operation via adaptive spatial or temporal assignment of hardware resources to network transactions with power, performance, and functionality scaling.<br\/><br\/>The proposed methodology to achieve these energy savings is measurement, modeling, and prototyping of new software and hardware. The PIs will build and evaluate a prototype of an advanced Ethernet interface for edge devices based on adaptive levels of functionality including proxying, smart wake-up, adaptive link rate, and reconfiguration. They will prototype software applications that use new semantics for power management notification across a network. They will disseminate the research outcomes to standards groups, government agencies, and\/or industry. The PIs will design and evaluate a fast autonegotiation mechanism for adaptive link rate suitable for consideration by the IEEE 802.3.

Linear-optics based QIP protocols have been recently developed, in which ordinary optical elements are used in conjunction with high-efficiency single-photon detectors, that show the potential for scalability if the overall quantum efficiency of the system can be maintained nearly perfect and suitably entangled quantum states can be prepared. To date, such linear-optics based QIP has been implemented using free-space optical elements in conjunction with entangled states generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in bulk nonlinear-optical crystals. <br\/>In free-space implementations of linear-optics based QIP, however, the transportation of quantum bits (qubits), subsequent coherent superposition of qubits, and the detection of qubits from different optical spatio-temporal modes, all suffer from a lack of scalability due to the use of bulk-optic nonlinear crystals. This is also because of optical diffraction, which limits the ability to transport qubits in free space. To avoid diffraction, one usually injects bulk-crystal generated entangled qubits into optical fibers. Such coupling of nonlinear-crystal generated entanglement to optical fibers for transportation is technically challenging, limiting the overall quantum efficiency and thus the achievable scalability. On the other hand, by implementing QIP functions directly in optical fiber, the problem of modal purity is solved as all involved optical modes have the very pure guided mode of an optical fiber. Recent work at Northwestern University has demonstrated the production of correlated-photon pairs in the telecom band of standard optical fibers, creation of polarization entanglement, and transmission of such fiber-generated entanglement for distances of up to 50 km. With such a source of entanglement, wide-area QIP can be envisioned as the low fiber loss in the telecom band can permit transmission of qubits for up to 50-100 km from one node to another in a distributed QIP environment. <br\/>This aim of this project is to demonstrate prototype tools and functionalities that make progress towards realizing distributed QIP. A fiber-based quantum logic gate with advantages discussed above will be developed. Additionally, an all-optical single-photon switch will be demonstrated, which is expected to be a crucial technology for controlling the flow of qubits in a linear-optics based quantum processor. Such all-optical switching promises to eliminate the inefficiencies inherent in electro-optical switching. It will allow the detection of one photon to cause the storage of its twin in a fiber loop, or the nondestructive readout of a stored photon to occur for further processing. Together, these QIP functions will add significantly to the ability to transmit, store, detect, and otherwise control a linear-optics based quantum processor. <br\/>Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity: The proposed activity will address a fundamental roadblock in the development of optics-based QIP, namely the need for optical-fiber based devices for manipulation and control of optical qubits.

Wright, Stevens Institute and Sheng Zhong, State University of New York at Buffalo<br\/><br\/>The rapid expansion of the Internet has changed the way we communicate, with ever-increasing aspects of our daily life involving computation and data communication. However, many communications protocol designs assume that all participants will follow the specified protocols, and do not maintain their desirable properties if they don't. One approach to this problem is to design for a world in which some parties may maliciously deviate from their protocols in arbitrary ways. However, the resulting designs are typically expensive or impossible to achieve, and in many cases overestimate the kinds of misbehavior one is likely to encounter. Weaker security goals are more achievable, but often underestimate the willingness of participants to cheat.<br\/><br\/>This project studies an intermediate notion of security, known as incentive compatibility. In many practical settings, it is reasonable to assume that users will tend to act in their own best interests. Therefore, if one can design and use protocols that are incentive-compatible, in that following the protocol produces outcomes for participants at least as good as deviating from the protocol, then one can in many settings avoid misbehavior. Incentive compatibility, which borrows ideas from economics and game theory, is a more finely tunable notion of security than traditional security models, allowing different kinds of participants motivated by different incentives. Such solutions can provide better trust and assurance than protocols secure only against passive adversaries, at a potentially lower cost than protocols secure against an arbitrarily malicious adversary. This allows incentive-compatible protocols to provide the \"right\" level of security, at the \"right\" cost.<br\/><br\/>Four areas studied are: incentive-compatible ad hoc networks, incentive-compatible data mining, (both of which can significantly benefit from introducing incentive-compatible solutions), testing tools for incentive compatibility, and foundations of incentive compatibility.","title":"Collaborative Research: CT-ISG: Incentive-Compatible Protocols","awardID":"0524030","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7371","name":"CYBER TRUST"}}],"PIcoPI":["536356"],"PO":["521752"]},"107665":{"abstract":"Fruit flies exhibit versatile and sophisticated capabilities of stimulus discrimination and<br\/>\"attention\"-like behavior.

We<br\/>will map the sites in the nervous system mediating the effect by manipulating neural activity.<br\/>This will be achieved in two opposing ways: one way by blocking activity and the other by<br\/>increasing activity. These perturbations will be targeted to different, restricted parts of the brain<br\/>by means of a set of genetically engineered fly strains we have developed and used over the<br\/>years. In this manner, we will map the funcitonal circuitry mediating a fruit fly's novelty<br\/>response by increasing or decreasing excitability in restricted brain regions.<br\/>Aim 1: Analyze the complex, organizational architecture by which the fruit fly's nervous system<br\/>achieves behaviorally the recognition of novelty.<br\/>Aim 2: Map the distribution of the 20-30 Hz LFP response in various brain regions, and the role<br\/>of coherence between these brain regions in the generation of the fruit fly's novelty response.<br\/>Brain-based devices provide the groundwork for the development of intelligent machines<br\/>that follow neurobiological rather than computational principles in their construction.

Such devices are particularly useful in situations of novelty<br\/>where computation is not possible in principle or in cases of great local complexity where<br\/>programming proves infeasible.

This combined methodology, called Patent Cartography, will leverage multiple taxonomies, related terms, network analytics, visualization, and user interaction to navigate, explore, and map the patent space. <br\/><br\/>As the rate of patenting has increased, so too has the problem of patent thickets, or dense webs of overlapping intellectual property rights that an organization must hack its way through in order to commercialize new technology. In certain industries characterized by cumulative innovations and multiple blocking patents, the existence of such densely concentrated patent rights can have the perverse effect of stifling innovation rather than encouraging it. A recent Federal Trade Commission report notes that in certain industries, the large number of issued patents makes it virtually impossible to search all the potentially relevant patents, review the claims contained in each of those patents, and evaluate the infringement risk or the need for a license. For many firms the only practical response to this problem of unintentional and sometimes unavoidable patent infringement is to file hundreds of patents each year so as to have something to trade during cross-licensing negotiations. In other words, the only rational response to the large number of patents in a given field may be to contribute to it. <br\/><br\/>Given that 200,000 US patents are issued each year, with new patents issuing each week, any attempt to analyze and comprehend the dynamic topology and interconnectedness of patent space will almost certainly have to be based on information technology. The process of patent search, however, has not progressed very much even with the advent of searchable patent databases. Although automated, the patent search process itself has not been reengineered and thus remains functionally similar to the patent search process developed in the nineteenth century. <br\/><br\/>While end-users do not have the necessary tools to conduct exhaustive patent searches, professional patent searchers are overwhelmed with an ever increasing workload driven by an increased awareness of the importance of intellectual property. The need for effective end-user patent search capabilities will only increase over time, yet the traditional search process must be reengineered for that need to be met. <br\/><br\/>Using sets of existing professionally-generated patent searches, this project will compare end-user searches conducted with existing tools with other searches conducted with the new methodologies. Several different classes of end-users have been identified, with different levels of previous knowledge and experience with the patent system, and this project will compare the search results produced by each class of user with the professional patent search results. At the conclusion of the study, we will have not only a better understanding of the applicability of Patent Cartography and visualization techniques to the process of patent search, but also an understanding of the impact of familiarity and experience with the patent system in harnessing the potential of Patent Cartography. <br\/><br\/>This project will expand the boundaries of document retrieval beyond simple keyword and category search into multidimensional analysis combining mixed initiative data and text mining with visualizations. The project will also combine content and network analysis and evaluate visualizations based on both proximity and dependency data. Search processes and search strategies will also be examined in the context of large document collections. The project will also develop models of task-based information searching, which has been generally under-explored. Finally, the project will develop an ethnographic account of the patent search process by observing patent search experts. <br\/><br\/>This project will extend the scope of research on searching, analyzing, and visualizing large document collections. Patents are one exemplary form of large digital library repositories that contain both structured and unstructured data to which these techniques can be applied. Other sources include Medline, Research Abstracts, repositories of the World Wide Web, and other enterprise repositories.

It is concerned with three core questions of social dynamics: How are practices of privacy and identity changing, what new patterns are evolving, and how is the relationship between technical and social being developed? The research will address these questions through ethnographic studies focused on two emerging areas - \"blogging\" and communication through mobile technologies - in which new practices surrounding privacy and identity are being developed. The results of this investigation will provide designers and policy-makers with a framework for understanding the mutual evolution of technology and practice in the areas of privacy and identity management.<br\/><br\/>Information technology is a key agent of change in contemporary society, and yet our understandings of technology, its shaping, and its impacts are typically fragmented. From an engineering perspective, IT is studied as a technological artifact and measured against predetermined goals; from a social or cultural perspective, it is often treated as a \"black box\" with little consideration of its nature and detail. This research project aims to address this balance, by bringing together an interdisciplinary group to study a critical nexus of information technology and society - the ways in which information practices in social groups serve to maintain boundaries of membership and information flow.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual approach of this project is based on five fundamental principles. The first is that information technology is a site of social and cultural production. The second is that technology reinscribes prior social and power structures. The third is that \"public\" and \"private\" are not rigidly dichotomous. The fourth is that rather than being seen in purely economic or informational terms, privacy should be approached as collective information practice. The fifth is that information practices are a means of identity work.<br\/><br\/>The increasing colonization of everyday life by information technology has major implications for society at large, and this is particularly true for the rise of mobile networked systems. Indeed, concerns over information privacy and security are topics of national and international deliberation. This research will provide individuals and policy-makers with tools to tackle these problems, and technologists with a deeper understanding of the relationship between technical and social in the systems that they develop. More immediately, this interdisciplinary partnership of social scientists and technologists is part of a developing program in interdisciplinary studies of information technology which draw not only on engineering but also on social science, arts, and humanities in order to form a holistic picture of technology and everyday life. By bringing different perspectives together on a problem of clear societal importance, this research will provide a means to integrate both graduate and undergraduate teaching across traditional disciplinary boundaries, building on existing bridges within curricula.","title":"Privacy, Identity, and Technology","awardID":"0527729","effectiveDate":"2005-09-15","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7318","name":"HSD - AGENTS OF CHANGE"}}],"PIcoPI":["464219","436513",286698],"PO":["564456"]},"106037":{"abstract":"A wide range of end-to-end channel coding techniques have been used in support of packet video applications over the Internet and other packet networks. Traditional end-to-end Forward-Error-Correction (FEC) techniques do not scale well though, and especially for large networks due to the large number of packet losses at deep nodes of the underlying distribution tree. Meanwhile, emerging network paradigms, such as overlay, peer-to-peer, and ad-hoc wireless networks, open the door for new approaches of delivering real-time video to a large number of receivers while maintaining high level of reliability and throughput.<br\/>Under this research project, a new framework, Network Channel Coding (NCC), that exploits emerging networking paradigms, such as peer-to-peer and overlay networks, are investigated and developed. This research optimizes NCC for generic network applications with emphasis on optimizing packet-video applications, their overall quality, and their throughput to a large number of receivers. In particular, optimum solutions for embedding and distributing channel coding functions within arbitrary network topologies (i.e., arbitrary graphs) are being investigated, analyzed, and designed. NCC optimization is being developed using cost-minimization under a rate-distortion (RD) like framework that maximizes throughput while minimizing the NCC overhead throughout the network. This framework reveals key theoretical limits and corresponding optimum NCC solutions that can be achieved for maximum-throughput and minimum-distortion packet video applications. Furthermore, practical and distributed NCC algorithms are being developed. Although general in nature, these distributed NCC algorithms are well suited for packet video over peer-to-peer and ad-hoc wireless systems. Furthermore, novel extensions in emerging areas, such as LDPC codes, cross-layer communications, and network (source) coding, are being explored and developed in the context of the optimization NCC framework.","title":"Network Channel Coding for Packet Video","awardID":"0515253","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["554511"],"PO":["432103"]},"106048":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>0515304<br\/>Satish B.

Studies by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) show that about 74 TWh\/yr of electricity (which is approximately $6 billion per year) is consumed by the Internet in the USA alone, of which 24 TWh\/yr or 32% could be saved with full use of power management on desktop computers, currently the most common of edge devices on the Internet. Unfortunately, due to limits of existing protocols and architectures, networked desktop computers typically remain powered-up during frequent and often lengthy periods of idleness. As network devices, they are prevented from operating in an energy-efficient manner due to their need to respond to network transactions of various types without warning. The NSF is currently funding projects to investigate energy-use reduction in first-level LAN switches, server clusters, and supercomputers, but severely lacking is research to reduce energy consumption of the largest portion of Internet energy consumers, the edge devices.<br\/><br\/>The principal investigators'(PIs) approach to addressing this challenge is to investigate and exploit a synergistic set of novel research concepts for protocol and subsystem infrastructure, and algorithms for effectively controlling them based on traffic and system constraints, so that desktop and other edge devices can be put to sleep during periods of relative idleness while network connectivity is maintained by a low-power hardware proxy integrated into the system. Moreover, the PIs' approach also promises to provide additional increases in energy efficiency by reducing consumption of network-related resources during active periods where graceful degradation of performance is acceptable, in effect trading off speed for energy. In addition to desktop computers, this approach will lead to similar solutions for a wide variety of emerging wired and wireless edge devices such as television set-top boxes, network appliances, remote cameras, etc.<br\/><br\/>The novel concepts in the proposed approach include: (1) protocol proxying in the network interface of a desktop computer and\/or within a first-level LAN switch to reduce minor use of system resources of the edge device and thus allow system power management to be fully exploited; (2) \"smart\" wake-up methods to allow power-managed devices to be awoken transparently and only when needed by existing applications and protocols, along with new power-management notification semantics for future network applications; (3) adaptive link rate in Ethernet to trade-off performance (or QoS) for energy efficiency by dynamically operating links at varying data rates (e.g., 1 or 10 Gb\/s only when needed, and otherwise at 10 or 100 Mb\/s); and (4) architectures for fixed or reconfigurable levels of staged hardware functionality to realize energy-efficient operation via adaptive spatial or temporal assignment of hardware resources to network transactions with power, performance, and functionality scaling.<br\/><br\/>The proposed methodology to achieve these energy savings is measurement, modeling, and prototyping of new software and hardware. The PIs will build and evaluate a prototype of an advanced Ethernet interface for edge devices based on adaptive levels of functionality including proxying, smart wake-up, adaptive link rate, and reconfiguration. They will prototype software applications that use new semantics for power management notification across a network. They will disseminate the research outcomes to standards groups, government agencies, and\/or industry. The PIs will design and evaluate a fast autonegotiation mechanism for adaptive link rate suitable for consideration by the IEEE 802.3. They also expect to play a key role in influencing future EPA Energy Star specifications for desktop computers and other edge devices (such as, potentially, television set-top boxes).

Since each individual gene locus is only a small part of the whole picture, association studies based on correlating variation at one or a few gene loci to disease outcomes may miss significant larger-scale associations. An attractive alternative that may be more revealing is to base association studies on correlations between disease outcomes<br\/>and haplotypes across selected genomic regions, A prerequisite for association studies, whether they are based on a few loci or on larger-scale haplotypes, is an accurate method for haplotype frequency estimation in a given population. The differences between the haplotype frequencies in a healthy population and in a population of<br\/>affected individuals may be subtle. Thus, getting an accurate estimate for the haplotype frequencies is extremely important for disease association studies. Estimating haplotype frequencies is a non-trivial task because current sequencing methods may produce noisy or incomplete data and typically yield genotypes, whose resolution into pairs of haplotypes is ambiguous. Existing methods for haplotype frequency estimation are mainly heuristic in nature, and they are only suitable for large samples of unrelated individuals from a homogenous population over short genomic regions. Any deviation from these conditions may result in inaccurate estimates. The main goal of this project is to develop efficient and accurate tools for haplotype frequency estimation under different conditions, and to integrate these methods with novel tools for disease association studies. In particular, the following activities are proposed: develop accurate, efficient and robust methods for haplotype frequency estimation over short and long genomic regions; extend these methods to deal with small sample size and deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium due to population substructure, and incorporate pedigree<br\/>information into the haplotype frequency estimator; integrate the resulting tools with a systematic tool for disease association studies that looks for candidate loci automatically using multiple calls to the haplotype frequency estimator; and launch a web server that will allow geneticists to upload their data and run the programs developed in the project on the fly through the web server.<br\/><br\/>The direct effect of the project would be to reduce the sample size needed for association studies, thus making more studies possible under the same budget constraints. This in turn will lead to a better understanding of complex diseases, which may speed up the search for diagnosis and treatment tools. The mathematical models introduced in this project may shed light on haplotype structure and on evolution. Furthermore, the project will address optimization problems and statistical learning<br\/>problems that may be of use beyond the scope of genetics.

Efficient techniques for analyzing information from the environment and public health related data, the focus of this proposed work, are crucial to organizations, which make decisions based on large spatial-temporal data sets. The applications of efficient models can be found useful in environment conservation and public health. Traditional data analysis and data mining techniques, which do not model spatial context and temporal effect, may lead to residual errors that vary systematically over space and time. The models derived may turn out to be not only biased and inconsistent, but may also be a poor fit to the data set. The traditional approaches towards solving spatial data analysis are to use classical data analysis tools by using spatial lag or error as one of explanatory variables. These techniques maximize classification accuracy, but spatial accuracy may be of more importance. Temporal and attribute accuracies are ignored in most of these predictive models. In addition, these approaches are often computationally expensive and are confounded with a large datasets.<br\/><br\/>A new computationally efficient spatial-temporal framework, ST-PUMS (Spatial-temporal<br\/>Prediction Using Map Similarity), which maximize map similarity (including spatial similarity, temporal similarity, and attribute similarity) instead of classification\/prediction accuracy was proposed. This work addresses how spatial-temporal autocorrelation, the characteristic property of spatial-temporal data, can be incorporated in the ST-PUMS framework. ST-PUMS framework searches the parameter space of models using a new map-similarity measure that is more appropriate in the context of spatial-temporal data. In addition to modeling spatial accuracy, ST-PUMS can also be extended to incorporate temporal and attribute accuracies in the model. ST-PUMS will provide a solution for the difficulties encountered in analyzing spatial-temporal<br\/>data.

The solutions will have a direct impact on several important areas, such as environmental conservation, criminology and justice, real estate management and environmental epidemiology.

Intellectual Impact <br\/>Research is proposed on two Areas of Interest in NSF Solicitation 05-501: Development of a broad <br\/>and general collection of quantum algorithms; Quantum simulation of quantum systems. Specific <br\/>topics: <br\/>Hidden subgroup problems: The status of the non-abelian hidden subgroup problem (HSP) <br\/>is one of the most fundamental open problems in quantum algorithms. In particular, the graph <br\/>automorphism problem may be formulated as a hidden subgroup problem over the symmetric <br\/>group S n . The abelian case can be effectively computed with a quantum computer by repetition <br\/>of coset state preparation and Fourier sampling. The natural generalization of this method to <br\/>nonabelian groups is commonly referred to as the standard method for the nonabelian HSP. The <br\/>performance of this algorithm depends upon properties of the irreducible complex representations <br\/>of the group. However in most cases they do not yet yield useful algorithms. Research is proposed <br\/>on improving these methods as well as determining in which cases they are bound for failure and <br\/>other methods are necessitated. <br\/>Algorithmic cooling: Algorithmic cooling is an inescapable component of quantum algorithms: <br\/>for example, we can even view fault-tolerant computing as moving heat (random errors) out of the <br\/>computation registers. These issues are particularly pressing in the context of liquid-state NMR <br\/>quantum computing as well as ion trap quantum computing, and we have studied them (especially <br\/>in the NMR context) in the past, obtaining results that are nearly best-possible for closed-system <br\/>cooling. These results reveal, however, that closed-system cooling cannot be powerful enough to <br\/>turn warm systems into large-scale quantum computers. We are therefore turning to the study <br\/>of open-system algorithmic cooling. This requires new algorithmic techniques. Also, since open <br\/>systems are more sensitive to decoherence than closed systems, more careful modeling of these <br\/>effects will be required. <br\/>Fault-tolerant Quantum Comptutation: Decoherence is the major obstacle to the experimen- <br\/>tal realization of quantum computers. Over the last year there have been two significant break- <br\/>throughs in the ability to carry out fault-tolerant quantum computation in the presence of deco- <br\/>herence. The main idea in both cases is the use of uniquely quantum features to limit the exposure <br\/>of data to decoherence. We plan to explore these ideas further to a) improve the overhead in the <br\/>number of ancillas discarded and therefore the total number of qubits required b) improve the <br\/>threshold and decrease computational overhead for more realistic error-models <br\/>2. Broader Impact <br\/>Societal impact: Even if quantum computers are a distant reality, encryption of data today so that <br\/>it cannot be decrypted at a future time, depends upon the development of cryptosystems resilient <br\/>to attacks by quantum computers. This in turn demands an understanding of what problems are <br\/>and are not tractable on quantum computers, a core topic of the proposed research. <br\/>Educational impact: Ideas from quantum computation and quantum information can poten- <br\/>tially have a major impact on how basic quantum mechanics is taught (quite apart from teaching <br\/>quantum computation, which is also part of our efforts). We propose to create course material to <br\/>make this happen.","title":"QnTM: Collaborative Research: Quantum Algorithms","awardID":"0524837","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["402689"],"PO":["521045"]},"95527":{"abstract":"The goal of this research project is to study the interplay between constraints and mappings in interactions from XML to XML sources, or XML to relational data sources.

Making sense of this massive data requires sophisticated computer sciences techniques such as data classification, approximation and optimization. All of these techniques can be improved substantially by making effective use of prior knowledge that is often readily available. For example doctors' experience can be utilized in obtaining improved classifiers for various types of important problems, such as medical diagnosis and prognosis. Since the most powerful state-of the-art classifiers are based on support vector machines, which in turn are formulated as constrained or unconstrained optimization problems, the aim is that prior knowledge be incorporated into various optimization-based applications such as classification and approximation problems as well into the theory of optimization itself. To a large degree, this proposal is motivated by the investigators' extensive collaborative work with oncologists, surgeons and medical physicists and the investigators' desire to make full use of the expertise of such practitioners by incorporating it into computable but rigorous models.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit of the proposed work lies in the use of rigorous theory and problem analysis techniques that incorporate domain specific information into general optimization problems. The research will first incorporate knowledge into a linear or nonlinear support vector machine classifier and show that such incorporation is possible by appending additional constraints to the original problem. Preliminary tests indicate improvements in classifier accuracy. Secondly, prior knowledge will be introduced into approximation problems. Thus, in addition to given discrete data that is normally used to generate an approximation to an unknown function, prior knowledge is also taken into account. Finally, prior knowledge will be incorporated into general constrained or unconstrained optimization problems, wherein the prior knowledge consists of new constraints to be imposed on the behavior of the objective function on various regions. The generality of these new techniques will facilitate the integration of information from disparate sources, since the theory allows multiple sets of prior information to be included concurrently. Specific application to radiotherapy treatment planning problems will ensure the computer science advancements are demonstrably useful in a particular problem domain.<br\/><br\/>The optimization, modeling, and computational techniques will provide a boost to advances in cancer diagnosis and prognosis, chemotherapy, and other treatment regimes. The knowledge-based approach encompasses a broad spectrum of important classification and approximation problems that have wide applicability <br\/>in science and engineering. The work will also raise the profile of data mining techniques in other areas such as surgery, pharmacology, and medical research, by demonstrating how the methodologies can be <br\/>utilized to incorporate prior knowledge into both planning and design issues, and improving both efficiency of delivery and effectiveness of treatment in many clinical settings. By coupling the education of several <br\/>computer science and engineering students with the proposed work, a new group of multidisciplinary researchers will be trained that will ensure the technical advances are applied to further application domains.","title":"SEI: Knowledge-Based Data Classification, Approximation and Optimization","awardID":"0511905","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7294","name":"SCIENCE & ENGINEERING INFORMAT"}}],"PIcoPI":[277902,"520933"],"PO":["563727"]},"107699":{"abstract":"NSF 0523450<br\/><br\/>Workshop on Visualization for Computer Security <br\/><br\/>Kwan-Liu Ma<br\/><br\/>This award supports a workshop held in Minneapolis, Minnesota during the week of Oct. 24, 2005, in conjunction with Visualization 2005 Conference (Vis2005), and the Information Visualization 2005 Symposium (InfoVis2005) in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Programming sensor networks is a difficult and error prone task as they often exhibit continuous reconfiguration caused by environmental factors and energy depletion, the introduction of new sensors, and the presence of various forms of mobility internal and external to the network. This project is developing a flexible software infrastructure that allows the programmer to treat the sensor network as a shared, evolving, geographically distributed, general-purpose computing milieu. This infrastructure achieves an unprecedented level of flexibility, fluidity, and adaptability by structuring applications in terms of a community of coordinating mobile agents. Agents are able to enter and exit the sensor network and to construct and evolve complex applications by exploiting new forms of code and state mobility and dynamic composition. They are able to maintain the integrity of the application and its relation to the physical environment being monitored by exploiting new coordination techniques that include a spatiotemporal dimension. A distinguishing feature of the proposed software infrastructure is its unified treatment of all forms of mobility encountered in sensor network applications: movement of entities in the physical environment, movement of the user, movement of code within the network and across network boundaries, and even the movement of sensors making up the network. This project is creating the very first agent-based, software infrastructure for the development of flexible sensor network applications. It allows programmers to design applications that can be deployed when needed and as needed, can share network resources, can limit their network usage only to regions of interest, can adapt to network and environmental conditions, and can reduce energy consumption.","title":"NeTS-NOSS: Fluid Software Infrastructure for Wireless Sensor Networks","awardID":"0520220","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["384032","560533"],"PO":["564777"]},"108579":{"abstract":"The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) will continue the AAAS\/NSF Fellowship Program to provide post-doctoral and mid-career scientists and engineers with insight into the decision-making process in science, engineering and technology.

The approaches to be pursued include combination of simulation and hardware assists. The memory performance of distributed simulations must improve if the benefits of emergent high-end systems are to be realized. To hide the effects of memory latency, the complexity of systems used as building blocks (e.g. SMPs) in large-scale clusters has increased substantially. The combination of memory speed, node complexity and system scale often leads to poor performance. Years of intense research aimed at improving the performance of applications in parallel and distributed systems have led to average efficiencies of 5-10%. The continued exponential increase in complexity makes maintaining these efficiencies through tuning challenging. Improving efficiency dramatically will require innovation. The project will improve distributed simulation performance in SMP-based clusters through creation of a new set of software tools that enable access to coordinated hardware counter information across system components (e.g. CPU and NIC).

Second, elevating overlays to first-class objects places special emphasis on the coordinated assignment of complex collections of network resources (e.g., bandwidth, storage, computational cycles, shared information) to competing overlays in an economically coherent, computationally practical fashion. This requires an Economic Framework for resource allocation. Third, there is a complementary question of how to define the basic unit of resource, and the challenges in the implementation of decisions made in resource allocation by means of Virtualization. Combined, these elements form the critical core of an operating environment for overlays; the necessary universal substructure for an overlay-enabled world.

There are two distinguishing features that are central to sensor networks. One distinguishing feature is that sensor networks are driven by sensor data, data which are not independent from node to node as in a data network, but which are correlated spatially as well as temporally. Thus one of the goals of the project is to investigate how to operate such networks efficiently taking full advantage of such correlations. A second distinguishing feature of sensor networks is that one is not generally interested in transporting all the sensory data generated at a node to another node. Rather, the purpose of a sensor network is to perform inference from the data (e.g., alarm networks) or make estimates from the data (e.g., mean temperature). More generally, the purpose of a sensor network is to compute an appropriate function of the data, both temporal as well as spatial, and make decisions based on the data. Thus the another focus of the research is an architecture for sensor networks to organize the in-network computation and communication taking advantage of all the distributed computational resources as well as the wireless communication medium, while respecting their possible limitations on energy, bandwidth, memory, etc. The tools used for conducting the research include network coding for distributed function computation, routing and data storage, distributed compression and cryptography. The results of the project will be disseminated through publications in major conferences and journals, and through a demonstration of data streaming for target monitoring and detection towards the end of the project.","title":"Collaborative Research: NeTS-NOSS: Towards a Theory of In-Network Computation for Surveillance and Monitoring in Wireless Sensor Networks","awardID":"0519535","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["541861","509442",281854],"PO":["564777"]},"107864":{"abstract":"Yau-Kim abstract<br\/><br\/>Collaborative Research: CT-T: Security and Survivability of Real-time Systems with MANETs<br\/>Real-time systems with mobile ad hoc networks (mRTS) have potential applications in many areas, including scientific research, healthcare, disaster recovery, environment control, military and homeland security, and industrial process control. For example, such systems can provide<br\/>mission critical support for operations in disaster and rescue situations, such as the recent devastating tsunamis throughout South Asia, where the entire communication infrastructure was destroyed. This research focuses on system requirements for security, survivability and real-time performance by focusing on three interacting aspects: specification and analysis of security and real-time requirements for mRTS; constraint-aware survivable communication techniques to provide reliable wireless communication in mRTS; and integration of security, fault-tolerant real-time performance, and survivable wireless communication for mRTS. The project seeks to develop: (a) a general mRTS model and a policy specification language for specifying security and real-time requirements, (b) algorithms for constraint-aware fault tolerant topology control in MANETs, (c) a channel access scheduling protocol for real-time applications that are delay-sensitive and delay-stringent. This research builds on prior work that developed a Time-triggered Message-triggered Object programming and specification framework, and a situation-aware distributed security policy enforcement scheme.<br\/><br\/>The results of this research are expected to greatly improve mobile ad hoc network applicatons, such as disaster rescue and will foster interaction between ad-hoc networks and the existing global information infrastructure.

Brasseur<br\/>INSTITUTION NAME: Pennsylvania State University<br\/><br\/>MICRO-SCALE TRANSPORT AS A CRITICAL LINK BETWEEN MOLECULAR-SCALE ABSORPTION AND MACRO-SCALE MIXING IN GUT PHYSIOLOGY AND FUNCTION<br\/><br\/>Digestion and pharmaceutical efficacy of the small bowels depends on the transport of molecules originating in the bulk flow across the mucosal epithelium, and the transport of secreted molecules to the bulk flow with macro mixing at the 1-2 cm scale. Absorption and secretion are rate-limited by diffusion of molecules to\/from epithelial cells covering multitudes of finger-like protuberances, or \"villi\" (approximately 100-500 microns in scale) that line the gut mucosa. The epithelial cells are, in turn, lined with \"microvilli\" (on the order of 1 micron in scale) directly involved in absorption. The process of digestion therefore relies on highly coupled multi-scale transport and mixing processes that span several orders of magnitude. The research will focus on the details and neurophysiological controls of absorption and secretion through systems models that integrate the entire range of scales from macro-mixing to molecular absorption, centering on villi-induced micro-transport as a critical link to absorption. Coupled macro- to micro- models will be integrated with animal experiments in which micro-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to quantify space-time mucosal and villi motion in vivo. The PI's will develop a new class of algorithms that couple dual-scale lattice-Boltzmann (LB), molecular dynamics (MD) and moving boundaries. The coordination of modeling with experiment can yield critical knowledge never before uncovered. This is a unique approach to analyze a medically important physiological system (gut absorption). The importance of the area of research to medical science and clinical practice cannot be over stated. Many major diseases are associated with the GI tract, and most of these affect digestion through alterations in absorption and\/or secretion. Scientifically, this program has the potential to open a new area of potentially important research with implications to basic physiology, disease, clinical evaluation, and treatment. The research team includes new collaborations among bioengineers with expertise in modeling, experiment, and MRI technology, a GI cellular and molecular neurophysiologist, an LB expert, and a clinical scientist. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in a highly interdisciplinary program both across very different subject areas (physiology, mechanics, and medicine) and across methodologies (modeling, experiment, and IT). Through this program The PI's will train engineers in physiology and medicine, and physiologists and clinical scientists in the principles of engineering. A particular focus will be on the undergraduate students where the PI's aim to excite exceptional students to go on to higher levels of education while moving in new interdisciplinary directions. Members of underrepresented groups will be recruited in order to provide particular encouragement for their involvement in the highest levels of interdisciplinary education, scientific analysis, and advances in technology.","title":"Micro-scale Transport as a Critical Link between Molecular-scale Absorption and Macro-scale Mixing in Gut Physiology and Function","awardID":"0506215","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0304","name":"Division of MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES","abbr":"DMS"},"pgm":{"id":"7454","name":"MSPA-INTERDISCIPLINARY"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"7368","name":"SCI TESTBEDS"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0702","name":"Division of CHEM, BIOENG, ENV, &  TRANSP S","abbr":"CBET"},"pgm":{"id":"1443","name":"FLUID DYNAMICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0702","name":"Division of CHEM, BIOENG, ENV, &  TRANSP S","abbr":"CBET"},"pgm":{"id":"5345","name":"BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0702","name":"Division of CHEM, BIOENG, ENV, &  TRANSP S","abbr":"CBET"},"pgm":{"id":"7446","name":"MATH PRIORITY SOLICITATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["551667","426490",274895,"348574","421817"],"PO":["525323"]},"109867":{"abstract":"This project explores the effective implementation, distribution, and analysis of the Surgical Interactive Multimedia Modules (SIMMs), a rich media, web-based, open source educational tool.

The SIMMs utilize state-of-the-art multimedia to ensure novice clinicians have the opportunity to expand and practice their clinical competence skills.

However, to efficiently carry DiffServ traffic over an MPLS network, a mapping between DiffServ classes and LSPs is needed. Moreover, the design and management of such a network is a fundamental key to the success of the QoS provisioning and it includes several open research issues. Many problems need to be solved such as LSP dimensioning, set up tear down procedures, routing, adaptation to actual carried traffic, preemption, initial definition of the network topology, etc. Furthermore, in designing network planning and management methods, we have to take into account the high unpredictability of the Internet traffic.<br\/><br\/>Our proposal is a comprehensive study that describes practical solutions for MPLS network planning along with bandwidth and route management, which interwork in a synergetic fashion. The presented ideas are novel paradigms that allow MPLS networks to adapt their state to provide the best possible performance and resource utilization. We propose to design, evaluate and fine-tune these new ideas. <br\/><br\/>In the bandwidth management portion of the project, new methods for LSP setup, dimensioning, preemption, and capacity allocation will be designed. The route management research includes novel algorithms for LSP routing and bandwidth request routing. Finally, in the network planning research we will investigate methods to design the optimal MPLS network topology and its dimensioning based on predicted traffic loads and long term Service Level Specification (SLS) contracts.<br\/><br\/>To illustrate the inter-relations of the above mentioned research topics, consider a scenario where network planning methods have provided an initial topology of the MPLS network. Possible events include the arrival of a request for LSP setup or arrival of a bandwidth request. The first event can be handled by the combined use of three of our proposed methods, in the order: LSP routing, LSP preemption, and LSP capacity allocation. The LSP routing aims to find the route on the physical network over which the LSP will be routed. LSP preemption decides if any existing LSPs can be preempted on the route to make way for the new LSP in the case in which there is not enough available bandwidth. The LSP capacity allocation method tries to fine tune the LSP capacity to avoid unused reserved bandwidth. The event of arrival of a bandwidth request triggers the LSP setup and dimensioning, which may in turn trigger the LSP creation steps of routing, preemption and capacity allocation.<br\/><br\/>The potential impact of this proposal is the development of novel and practical methods which currently are open issues in the design and management of DiffServ-based MPLS networks. Significant progress and contributions to the study of MPLS network management have already been made in our publications. This previous work will be useful towards achieving the proposed objectives.","title":"ITR: Network and Traffic Engineering for DiffServ MPLS-Based Networks","awardID":"0606608","effectiveDate":"2005-09-29","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["509128"],"PO":["7594"]},"104774":{"abstract":"This project develops real-time control of systems with dynamic thermal management (DTM-also called thermal throttling). DTM allows the cooling solution to be designed for less than the worst case, an approach that is becoming necessary with exponentially increasing power densities and shrinking form factors. At runtime, if heat dissipation exceeds the cooling solution's capacity for a sustained period of time and on-chip temperatures approach dangerous levels, DTM places the processor in some form of low-power mode that allows temperatures to fall back to a safe level. The problem is that DTM in current systems is typically engaged autonomously by the hardware when thermal stress is imminent, without any warning. This is incompatible with real-time scheduling. To reconcile runtime thermal management with real-time control, new scheduling algorithms and requisite software and hardware support are being developed in this research. This includes fast estimation of a workload's future thermal load, estimation of the likelihood and scheduling impact of DTM, and new methods that allow the operating system to choose the most convenient time to engage DTM.

Like any instrument, however, sensor networks suffer from impairments that adversely impact the integrity of the sensed information about the physical phenomena. The causes of reduced integrity in sensor networks are many, and include various internal and external uncertainties in the sensing, processing, and communication elements of the system. Examples include calibration errors, faults, sensing channel degradation and obstructions, bio-fouling etc. This project is comprehensively addressing the integrity problem by studying its causes, understanding fundamental limits, developing algorithms and system support, and validating the approach in real-life. The two key elements of the overall approach are autonomous detection of integrity compromise, and resilient estimation and aggregation. Underlying these two are novel statistical and signal-processing techniques that exploit learned models of the physical phenomenon, the measurement process, and the faults which result in corrupted or missed data. In addition, the project is investigating approaches for guiding remediation of the causes of integrity problems, and for integrity-driven deployment of sensor network to achieve desired resilience. The research would result in a thorough understanding of integrity failure in sensor networks, and result in a toolkit of design tools and run-time software for ensuring high-integrity operation. These would be validated via terrestrial, under-soil, and aquatic ecological observation application, and also disseminated for broader use via the project web site at http:\/\/nesl.ee.ucla.edu\/projects\/integrity.","title":"NeTS-NOSS: Algorithms and System Support for Data Integrity in Wireless Sensor Networks","awardID":"0520006","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["539242","515835","537785","451118"],"PO":["434241"]},"106974":{"abstract":"This project investigates the concept of cooperation between nodes in a wireless network to increase its traffic capacity and reduce radio interference. Currently, transmissions between two nodes overheard by a third node are discarded. It has been shown that this overheard information can be used by the third \"helper\", through additional transmissions, to increase the capacity of the network. Alternatively, the cooperating nodes can also reduce the power needed to transmit the same amount of information as a network without cooperation. The notion of cooperation will be investigated both for the actual bits being transmitted, as well as in the medium access and routing protocols that facilitate and exploit it. The research will consider ad hoc networks in addition to infrastructure-based networks.<br\/><br\/>This work shows how to increase the capacity of wireless networks, and allow for a better spatial reuse of a limited amount of bandwidth by reducing the interference to other nodes in the vicinity.

Many envisioned applications of sensor networks involve monitoring of mobile objects, such as vehicles or animals. This project designs, analyzes and implements lightweight sensor-aided distributed directories, which can guide users to current locations of (mobile) objects, and answer individual or aggregate queries about them. Directories are designed using locality as a primary criterion: the effect of a perturbation in an object's position or in the network structure must be local, and should not cascade beyond a restricted region that is close to the perturbation. Directories are designed to simultaneously manage multiple mobile objects or groups of objects moving together. <br\/><br\/>The project investigates the construction of novel directory schemes based on various distributed computation techniques, including link reversal, path reversal, hierarchical methods, and sketching of distributed data streams. The resulting directories are scalable, energy-efficient, and resilient to network failures. The performances of the directories are evaluated through a combination of theoretical analysis, simulation, and implementation on a sensor network testbed that has been built at Iowa State University. It is expected that the research will enable sensor-aided object monitoring at a much larger scale than is now possible, and will benefit any application of sensor networks that involves tracking mobile objects. The research will involve students at various levels of the educational system. The results of this research will be widely disseminated through publications in journals and conferences, and will be posted online at CoRR.","title":"Collaborative Research: NeTS-NOSS: Distributed Algorithms for Sensor-Aided Directories to Mobile Objects","awardID":"0520102","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["511486","382141"],"PO":["564777"]},"103234":{"abstract":"Large amounts of nitrogen fertilizer are used to increase yields of cereal crops worldwide, resulting in higher crop input costs, greater energy requirements for crop production, and negative impacts on water quality due to excess nitrogen.

Until recently, individual labs have simply imposed local homogeneity of format and procedure, and not stored lab-dependent metadata. This ad hoc system is limited, however, as crystallographers begin to cross between labs to accomplish their research objectives, and as increasing numbers and sizes of output data streams leave less time for each investigation. Local workflow must be made explicit, procedures must be formally described, and the history and assemblages of data expressed in an open, shareable way. Creation and management of complete, accessible records for each experiment is critical, as well as heterogeneity in data acquisition and management across the field. <br\/><br\/>To meet that need, this project will develop a framework of web service interfaces and data and metadata systems addressing the whole spectrum of crystallography. Project participants and collaborators will leverage existing projects, such as Reciprocal Net and Common Instrument Middleware Architecture, that address narrower issues in the problem domain. The CGF will also draw on collaborating projects with overlapping areas of interest, such as the UK-based Comb-e-Chem project. The resulting framework will be a useful environment for crystallographic investigations and an extensible platform on which new web-based applications can be built.<br\/><br\/>The CGF project involves the classic problem of dealing with heterogeneity in data, procedures, and instruments in the crystallography application space, and another classic problem in integrating the entire data collection, transport, and curation requirements of the domain into a seamless beginning to end system. The challenge is to create a virtualization system that manages heterogeneity in more than a single aspect and to provide vertical integration using only open, extensible, and interoperable standards and methodologies.<br\/><br\/>While the project constitutes research into pertinent computer science problems, the plan for performing the research is centered on producing a product (the CGF) that will immediately be useful in addressing emerging technical problems in the field of X-ray crystallography. Within crystallography, one of the specific goals is to make structural results accessible that might otherwise never be seen, and so the CGF will help increase the body of scientific knowledge and improve the return on federal investment in the large numbers of x-ray diffractometers and associated instruments nationwide. Although the project targets specifically a few hundreds of crystallography labs worldwide, the software and methods created in it are intended to be reusable for any science moving from individual lab practices to a shared, global collaboratory system. In sciences such as high-energy physics and astronomy, the scientists have long shared single, unique, large instruments and had to create shared data management and instrument metadata. CGF is likely to be useful in other scientific disciplines which still use widely-distributed lab-based instruments that now need to be linked in data grids.","title":"Collaborative Research: The CrystalGrid Framework","awardID":"0513687","effectiveDate":"2005-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7294","name":"SCIENCE & ENGINEERING INFORMAT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7373","name":"ITR-INFORMATION INTEGRATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7602","name":"INFORMATION INTEGRATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0801","name":"Division of ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY","abbr":"DEB"},"pgm":{"id":"7298","name":"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["426520"],"PO":["565136"]}}
