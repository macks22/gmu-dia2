{"5259":{"abstract":"The project is studying the feasibility of using high level programming constructs which directly express the parallelism in an algorithm. Although parallelizing compilers for sequential programming languages provide good results for some numerical codes, namely those with regular communication patterns, such compilers are not effective in extracting parallelism in dynamic programs. The methodology used in this project is to express a computation as a collection of encapsulated, asynchronous fine- grained objects, or actors, which interact by sending each other messages. The project is studying ways of reducing the costs associated with managing fine-grained objects and messages. Moreover, because efficient execution on concurrent computer architectures also requires architecture-specific placement (and migration) strategies, the project is studying methods to allow code for placement to be independently expressed and combined with code for the logical operations in an algorithm. The advantage of such a separation is to allow portability of the algorithmic code across a wide range of concurrent architectures. ***","title":"Efficient Implementation of Dynamic Parallel Programs","awardID":"9523253","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"1999-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2876","name":"DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2890","name":"CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES"}}],"PIcoPI":["460466"],"PO":["250083"]},"6018":{"abstract":"This project examines new language mechanisms for accessing message invocations in message passing based concurrent programming languages.

In addition, they are all subfamilies of the class of graphs called the asteroidal triple-free graphs (AT-free graphs, for short). This project extends the research completed under CCR-94-07180: the PI has shown that every connected AT-free graph contains a dominating pair (i.e., a pair (x,y) of vertices with the property that all (x,y)-paths represent dominant sets), which can be found in linear time. In spite of these encouraging first steps in the study of AT-free graphs, the structure of the AT-free graphs is not well understood. In particular, no efficient recognition algorithm is available. The research effort investigates the ATfree graphs using the powerful tool of graph decomposition, with the intention to reveal new structural properties of AT-free graphs that can be exploited to obtain efficient sequential and parallel algorithms.

However, the very features which make the object-oriented paradigm attractive also make object-oriented programs more difficult to understand. The majority of current object- oriented software development environments and aids provide textual interfaces through which programmers can answer queries about the program state and assess program performance. The hypothesis of this project is that textual tools for understanding object-oriented programs, although absolutely essential, either fail to provide all the information required by programmers about the dynamics and global behavior of their code, or they provide information in a manner that is cumbersome to acquire. Program visualization, through the use of graphics and animation, provides users with a more complete understanding of their code, both statically and dynamically. The goal of this project is to develop a visualization framework with innovative graphical views that assist programmers to understand, analyze, test, debug, and optimize their code. The views illustrate both important details about a program and the global context of how particular pieces of code relate to the entire program. An initial technique being used is called the Information Mural, which presents very large program event traces using a focus-plus-context display.

In this environment, the time required for the transmission of a fixed size information block (slot) has been constantly decreasing. A direct consequence of a shrinking slot is that time intervals (in seconds) increase in size, when measured in network time units (slots). As a result, time intervals which were considered to be too small in the past seem larger and -- for that matter -- their interpretation and associated functionalities may need to be reconsidered. In the shrinking slot environment time is becoming a commodity which may be used more effectively in the design of high-speed networks. The proposed research will be focused on the development of traffic management schemes which incorporate rather explicitly the significant time-constants (in slots) associated with the traffic generation process and QoS descriptors of the diversified applications in a high speed networking environment. Both, traditional computer-data-type and real time applications will be considered. In the first part of the proposed research, a Time-Constant-Based Call Admission and Traffic Control (TC-based CATC) framework is presented, for controllable (or, ABR\/UBR in ATM Forum's classification) applications. This proposal is based on the positive impact of a large time-constant associated with a controllable application, on the effectiveness of a feedback-based traffic control scheme; this impact has been observed in preliminary results. The proposed class of TC-based traffic control policies can be viewed as a class of ``generalized'' adaptive, rate-based traffic control policies, since classical adaptive, rate-based policies are included in this large class. As a result, there is great potential to substantially improve on the performance achieved by the past schemes. The TC-based CATC scheme is expected to provide for a faster response to bandwidth availability fluctuations at different time-scales, by employing distinct mechanisms for the different time-scales. It is easy to argue that the proposed TC-based policies are scalable. In the second part of the proposed research, multiplexing schemes for real-time applications are considered. These schemes attempt to preserve time-constants of importance associated with these applications and\/or take advantage of time-constant-based Quality of Service requirement, to maximize resource utilization. Specific proposals include the integration of the regulation and scheduling functions to improve performance by coordinating their functionality, as well as ``reinvent'' statistical multiplexing for real-time applications by taking advantage od the increased room for traffic manipulation in time, as the network speed increases and QoS-defining time-constants increase. Finally, a major part of the proposed research will be dedicated to the study of a number of interesting problems arising from the above proposals, which are becoming increasingly relevant to the broad high speed networking environment as the network time unit decreases.","title":"Time-Constant-Based Traffic Control and Multiplexing for High-Speed Networks","awardID":"9628116","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"1999-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4091","name":"NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":[40439],"PO":["150490"]},"16171":{"abstract":"9628469 Dunn Tusculum College requests support from NSF for connection to an Service Provider who will give the campus access to the Internet, a collection of interoperable networks connecting most research and education organizations in the United States.

Multicomputers offer significant advantages over shared- memory multiprocessors in terms of cost and scalability. Unfortunately, extracting all the computational power from these machines requires users to write efficient software for them, which is an extremely laborious and error-prone process. The distribution of data across processors is of critical importance to the efficiency of the parallel program in a distributed memory system. In this project the problem of automated data distribution in such machines is being investigated. The approach is unique in that it is based on sophisticated cost models of communication and computation that are parameterized by architectural metrics empirically measured for different target machines. Using the cost estimates, data distributions are selected to minimize the overall execution time of the program by maximizing parallelism (while maintaining load balance) and minimizing the amount of communication overhead (by maximizing data locality). Both static and dynamic distribution will be supported in a unified framework to automatically select data distributions which can dynamically change over the course of a program's execution in order to provide scalable parallel performance for large, complex applications. This approach not only has a solid theoretical basis, but is being integrated into a sophisticated compiler which can actually generate code for a variable number of processors supporting all block, cyclic, and block-cyclic data distributions. The compilation techniques investigated in this project will also be integrated with simultaneous support for regular and irregular accesses in parallel applications through a novel interval-based representation. ***","title":"Efficient Compilation Issues for Scalable Distributed-Memory Multicomputers","awardID":"9526325","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"1999-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}}],"PIcoPI":["295247"],"PO":["150697"]},"17030":{"abstract":"In business, government, and all aspects of life where planning is important, there is a need for database management systems that can handle `decision-support queries.` These complex queries involve the aggregation of very large amounts of data.

Analysis based upon the \"typicality\" of the data has become one of the primary theoretical and practical concepts in modern information theory. The so-called \"Type\" (appropriate histogram estimators of the amplitude distribution) have not only been shown to be sufficient statistics for both classification and compression, but have also been shown to converge exponentially fast to the true underlying distribution. Because type-based detectors make no a priori assumptions about the channel characteristics and measure the quantities needed to provide asymptotically optimal reception, these detectors can theoretically achieve the same exponential error rate as the clairvoyant receiver that knows the channel characteristics perfectly and uses them optimally. Measurements made during succeeding transmissions, possibly using the data transmissions themselves in a decision feedback paradigm, can be used to track channel variations. The approach will be extended to deal with intersample dependencies and colored noise by using channel measurements in an optimally effective way. Two techniques drawn from data compression work, context trees and Lempel-Ziv (universal) coding, will be examined to determine which represents channel-induced dependencies most efficiently and which is most adaptable. By merging systems based on these two theories, a receiver that adapts to unknown, time-varying channels will be developed. It will be demonstrated that this receiver can be used in multiuser channels, both wireless and optical fiber, with little modification. The research will develop the theoretical underpinnings of this adaptive receiver strategy, and will develop a complete software implementation of the receiver, using as test data actual communication channel recordings.

This project will be used as a vehicle to introduce undergraduate students to the research process and actively involve students in the theoretical investigation, the implementation, the experimentation, and the dissemination of the results. Students will be encouraged to involve themselves in all aspects of this project. ***","title":"RUI: Acquisition of Combining Optimizations to Create Powerful Parallelization Techniques","awardID":"9628760","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"1998-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2890","name":"CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1100","name":"Division of A\/D FUND","abbr":"A\/D"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"14","name":"Office of OFFICE OF POLAR PROGRAMS                ","abbr":"OPP"},"div":{"id":"1403","name":"Division of ANTARCTIC SCIENCES DIVISION","abbr":"ANT"},"pgm":{"id":"9171","name":"SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CENTERS"}}],"PIcoPI":[40981],"PO":["150697"]},"16075":{"abstract":"Internet traffic is growing rapidly due to the immense popularity of the World Wide Web and new multimedia services such as video-conferencing. The increased traffic volume requires higher speed (Gigabit\/sec or higher) links, while some of the new traffic varieties (such as audio and video) also demand quality-of-service guarantees. This proposal addresses the problem of providing high speed links by combining multiple low speed links and performing load balancing. It also address the problem of providing quality of service guarantees for high speed links through the design of efficient fair queuing algorithms. The proposal is concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of new and efficient fair queuing and load balancing algorithms. Although these two problems may look quite different at a first glance, the Pis show that fair queuing algorithms can be converted into load balancing algorithms using a time-reversal argument. Existing mechanisms for fair queuing either are computationally expensive, or they fail to provide the necessary service guarantees (e.g., good bounds on latency and throughput) required by many applications. The PIs develop a new fair queuing scheme called Tandem Clock Fair Queuing, which offers quality-of-service guarantees comparable to those of the best previous schemes (such as Weighted Fair Queuing), and yet appears to admit efficient implementations. Existing methods for load balancing provide inadequate load sharing in the presence of variable length packets, and may result in non-FIFO delivery of data if packet headers are not allowed to be modified. The PIs describe new load balancing schemes that solve these two problems by transforming fair queuing schemes into load balancing schemes, and by using the twin mechanisms of logical reception and sender simulation. The investigators propose to refine and extend these new directions in fair queuing and load balancing algorithms into complete and workable schem es that can be deployed in the Internet and other real networks. They plan to evaluate and refine our schemes using a combination of mathematical analysis, simulations, and actual implementation using a testbed.","title":"Efficient Fair Queuing and Load Balancing","awardID":"9628190","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2890","name":"CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4091","name":"NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["438592","536698"],"PO":["125800"]},"29275":{"abstract":"","title":"RIA: Vector Quantization for Noisy Channels","awardID":"9796138","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"1997-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4096","name":"COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["386026"],"PO":["409909"]},"29165":{"abstract":"","title":"Research Initiation Award: Overload Tolerance in Safety-Critical Systems","awardID":"9796028","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"1998-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2876","name":"DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["518412"],"PO":["250083"]},"12061":{"abstract":"This NSF-CONACyT Collaborative Renewal Award continues to apply techniques from the abstract mathematical area of simplicial algebraic topology (developed under CCR-9505949) to the problem of coordinating concurrent processes in a distributed or parallel computing system. Coordination problems arise at all scales of modern distributed and concurrent systems, way from synchronizing access to shared data objects in tightly-coupled multiprocessors, to allocating data paths in ATM networks. Coordination is difficult because modern parallel and distributed systems are inherently asynchronous (that is, processes may be delayed without warning for a variety of reasons, including interrupts, pre-emption, cache misses, communication delays, or failures). These delays can vary enormously in scale: (a) a cache miss might delay a processor for fewer than ten instructions; (b) a page fault for a few million instructions; and (c) operating system pre-emption for hundreds of millions of instructions. Coordination protocols that do not take such delays into account run the risk that if one processor is unexpectedly delayed, then the remaining processes may be unable to make progress. Such problems become increasingly severe as systems scale. In the past few years, a number of researchers have developed a range of new techniques, based on classical algebraic topology, for analyzing distributed and concurrent protocols and data structures. These techniques have been applied successfully, under the US-Mexico collaborative effort supported by CCR-9505949, to a range of computational problems. This renewal collaborative project extends these algebraic topological techniques to a range of more difficult problems, not just for distributed and parallel computing, but for any problem area that requires reasoning about uncertainty and partial information.***","title":"CONACyT: Topological Methods in Distributed and Concurrent Computation","awardID":"9613785","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"1999-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["554181"],"PO":["150516"]},"15240":{"abstract":"Modern programming languages encourage programmers to use abstraction and encapsulation to hide one moduleOs data representation details from other modules.

Most previous work on in-line expansion (in imperative languages) fails to inline higher-order and recursive functions, but in functional languages (and object- oriented languages, with dynamic methods) these can be crucial. Since modules can be compiled separately from each other, cross-module in-line expansion complicates program linkage. This work uses a lambda-calculus framework for cross-module in-line expansion, which cleanly separates the compilation- management issues from the inlining algorithms.

These applications include improving algorithms for quantum computation (1) by carrying out measurements at itermediate times, and (2) by error detection and correction. Quantum computation has recently attracted a lot of attention, because Peter Shor showed that certain tasks, including factoring large numbers, could be carried out in polynomial time on a quantum computer, whereas no polynomial-time algorithm for factoring on a ``classical'' computer is presently known. Clearly, if it could be built, such a computer would have many important applications in many areas of computational science, including in communications and information processing. Actually constructing such a quantum computer represents a daunting task, because of severe technical difficulties. One of the goals of this SGER project is to initiate a collaborative effort between computer scientists, theoretical physicists, and experimental physicists at Carnegie Mellon University, in order to explore the applications of the consistent histories framework to determining the feasibility of such a quantum computing device. The consistent histories approach make it possible to think about the computational process in more realistic terms (where atoms, photons, etc. are actually doing something over time) than is possible in the usual ``textbook'' approach, that views the quantum system as a ``great smokey dragon'' up until the point in time at which a final measurement is made, and the wave function of the system ``collapses'' into something which is physically understandable.***","title":"Consistent Histories and Quantum Computation","awardID":"9633102","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"1998-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0301","name":"Division of PHYSICS","abbr":"PHY"},"pgm":{"id":"1245","name":"THEORETICAL PHYSICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"Z696","name":"ARPA-CONS HIST & QUANTUM COMP"}}],"PIcoPI":["476755"],"PO":["150516"]},"15394":{"abstract":"Whose aim is to investigate the integration and impacts of residential Internet use among a sample of some 100 urban families in Pennsylvania and some 200 small-town Minnesota families.

THe objective is to optimize transmitter pulse shapes given a variety of assumptions concerning the channel model, receivers, and signaling constraints. Solutions to these problems reveal optimal multiple-access strategies, given particular sets of modeling assumptions. The work may also lead to adaptive algorithms for multi-user transmitter optimization which enable a significant increase in system capacity. Both linear time-invariant and statistical (i.e., Rayleigh fading) channel models will be considered. Models for an isolated cell (the multiple-access channel), an isolated pair of cells, and a linear array of cells are presented. In the latter two cases, neighboring base stations may share information (i.e., received or transmitted signals for the reverse or forward link, respectively). The multi-cell channel models can capture different combinations of intra- and inter-cell multiple-access schemes. Antenna diversity at the transmitter and\/or receiver will also be included. Receivers include the (single-user) matched-filter, and multi-user linear and decision-feedback detectors. In most cases the transmitters and detectors will be optimized according to a zero-forcing or Mean Squared Error criterion. For statistical channel models, the objective is to optimize performance averaged over the channel parameters. Multi-user transmitter optimization assuming multi carrier signaling will also be considered. In this case the objective is to maximize the size of the rate region by allocating transmitted bits and power to subchannels (independently for each user), subject to performance constraints. Finally, transmitter adaptation in the presence of time-varying channels and interference, and associated performance issues are studied.","title":"Multiuser Transmitter Optimization for Mobile Cellular Communications With Coordinating Base Stations","awardID":"9628365","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4096","name":"COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["560216"],"PO":["150411"]},"16153":{"abstract":"Networked services are at the heart of the information revolution. This work focuses on two characteristics of a networked service: 1) scalability: the ability of the service to handle a large number of end users with low per-user cost, and 2) individuality: the ability of the service to deal with differing requirements imposed because of heterogeneity of network paths leading to the end-users. Although a high level of both individuality and scalability are desirable features of any networked service, they are normally conflicting goals that need to be traded-off with each other. This research aims to investigate this tradeoff from the networking infrastructure's viewpoint. This project seeks to answer: 1) In services using multicast communication, is it possible to add a level of individuality while sacrificing scalability in a controlled manner? 2) In services using unicast communication, is it possible to improve scalability while controlling how much individuality is sacrificed? 3) Is it possible not to require the labeling of services as unicast or multicast and move the burden of deciding the appropriate network support to a \"generic\" interface layer? To answer these questions the research seeks to develop network support mechanisms to navigate the individuality\/scalability spectrum, giving multicast services the ability to be more individualized and unicast services the ability to be more scalable. The research will consist of investigating specific instances of adding a measure of individuality to multicast services and specific instances of making unicast services more scalable by sharing resources through multicast and requesting batching at servers. The research will include services such as video distribution, Web information delivery and multimedia-on-demand (live and streamed). The work will consider Internet as well as ATM-style networking with some emphasis on Internet over ATM architectures.","title":"Investigating the Individuality\/Scalability Tradeoff in the Provision of Networked Services","awardID":"9628397","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["550428"],"PO":["125800"]},"16087":{"abstract":"Network software is hard to design, implement, debug, and maintain. This basic problem is compounded by heterogeneity and the need for high performance. Heterogeneity results in multiplying the amount of networking software that must be developed and maintained. To improve performance, networking software is often hand-crafted in an operating system kernel, where software is particularly hard to debug and maintain. Emerging high-speed networking technology, coupled with next generation multimedia applications, is resulting in increased demand for high performance and extremely flexible networking software. A fundamental theme of this proposal is that advances in network software can only be achieved by an approach that simultaneously considers programming ease, platform diversity, and performance. This proposal investigates the use of compiler technology to rapidly prototype and automatically optimize complex protocol software. The result is network software that is easier to write, more portable, and more maintainable. Yet, with the appropriate automatic optimizations, the performance of such implementations should compare favorably to the performance of hand-crafted implementations. The first part of our proposal concerns techniques for automatically optimizing network software to achieve Gigabit link speeds. This involves inventing new optimization techniques (e.g., fusing together individual message demultiplexing definitions into efficient demultiplexing code), automating existing optimization paradigms (e.g., header prediction and address caching), and extending existing work on automated optimization techniques. Our plans call for building on the existing theory underlying optimizing compilers to unify various ad hoc techniques, and to provide a point of departure for producing new optimization techniques. The second part of our proposal involves a framework that integrates our optimization techniques to support rapid prototyping of efficient ne tworking software. We enable protocol code to be developed without undue attention paid to low-level wire data formats; operating system specific mechanisms for demultiplexing, synchronization, or error handling. This allows an extremely compact protocol description that is then compiled and optimized by our framework to a wide range of target environments. These environments include a simulator, application-level network interfaces, and shared-memory multiprocessor platforms.","title":"Compilation and Automatic Optimization of Network Protocol Implementations","awardID":"9628218","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4091","name":"NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["525751","438592","534923"],"PO":["125800"]},"29177":{"abstract":"","title":"Visual Information Processing","awardID":"9796040","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["384978"],"PO":["564898"]},"13041":{"abstract":"This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to measure, archive and distribute MPEG II video traffic from the 1996 Summer Olympics.

Many applications require reliable multipoint data delivery. Some well known examples are netnews, electronic mailing list, and network routing protocols such as BGP. Up until now, however, due to the lack of widely available support for both IP multicast and reliable multicast transport, these applications have been using multiple TCP connections to achieve reliable data delivery to multiple destinations, which results in both poor scalability and inefficient utilization of network resources. The goal of this research is to develop a framework and a set of mechanisms to provide efficient, robust, scalable, and reliable multicast data delivery both over very large networks and with very large multicast groups. The basic principles that have guided the design include the application level framing (ALF), the IP multicast group concept and receiver-initiated group management, and the core design principles of TCP\/IP --- simple datagram service, the end-to-end approach to reliability, and automatic adaptation to changing operational environment. The research will (1) systematically investigate the scaling issues with the proposed adaptive error recovery scheme; (2) develop mechanisms to localize error recovery traffic and substantially reduce the recovery overhead in the current design; (3) develop flow and congestion algorithms for many-to-many multicast data delivery; and (4) investigate new models for session message distribution to further improve the scalability.","title":"Scalable Reliable Multicast Transport for the Internet","awardID":"9628729","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["560926"],"PO":["125800"]},"16034":{"abstract":"Feedback-based congestion control schemes become an integral part of the connectionless ABR (Available Bit Rate) service class in ATM networks. The major objective of the proposed research is to build a theoretical foundation to feedback congestion control schemes. The basis of the foundation is the fixed-point model, which captures the feed-back feature of ABR congestion control schemes in a system of delay differential equations and produce fixed-point constant solutions in terms of the source cell rates and the buffer lengths. lamely, we consider a broad class of schemes which can produce a stable buffer length even when sources always try to transmit at their maximum rates. Analyses of the fixed point model in the context of ABR feedback control schemes have generated a number of results regarding stabilities of fixed-point solutions. The proposed research will first compare the stability region of parameter space derived from the delay differential equations with that obtained by discrete simulation techniques. We are interested in effects of incorporating details of control protocols in simulation on resulting changes in the stability region. Besides, the fixed point model will be investigated in the environments where ABR bandwidth changes in time as the number of CBR and VBR connections changes. Since the fixed-point model is constructed in a general context, application of the model to several control theoretic strategies (such as a proportional plus derivative control) will be investigated. When a congestion develops (either due to a new active ABR source or due to a reduced ABR bandwidth), buffer lengths increase before they stabilize to a new steady-state buffer length. Since buffer transients are inevitable, we will investigate strategies that can control the buffer transients in a predictable manner. We will first characterize transients in terms of bounds: the maximum overshoot in buffer lengths, the rise time until the buffer length reaches its maximum, and the settling time for the buffer length to reach its new steady-state value. According to the fixed-point model, relationships between the set of parameters and the transient bounds will be investigated. The relationships are to be studied in increasingly complex network configurations.","title":"Study of Feedback Congestion Control Techniques","awardID":"9628058","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"1999-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2890","name":"CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4091","name":"NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["496281",40399],"PO":["150490"]},"17497":{"abstract":"The objective of this proposed research is to develop a semantic foundation for semantic composition and interoperation of heterogeneous components of open systems. Composition and interoperation occur at many levels (requirements, specification, code, executables) and along multiple dimensions (functionality, reliability, security, availability). Relations among the various levels and dimensions must be preserved. Existing work on composition and interoperation has largely focused on syntactic structure. It is essential to develop a semantic basis in order to provide for safe, secure, and meaningful combinations. Semantic structuring of complex systems should provide a firm basis for determining what parts are interchangeable under given conditions, and to predict effects of changes: of components on the whole, and of system requirements on requirements for the parts. There is a wide range of applications where such a semantic foundation for interoperation can be of value. It is especially important in applications that combine components from diverse domains such as: data bases, spread sheets, knowledge bases, multi-media, mobile-agents, control theory, or event-based simulations. Metalogical methods from the theory of general logics, and associated techniques of mappings in and across formalisms, are used to achieve formalism-independent semantics for system composition. This supports the multidimensionality of a system's levels of description and formalization. Techniques from the theory of Open Mechanized Reasoning Systems (OMRS) as well as work on the formal semantics of actor systems are used to study interoperation aspects. Reflective techniques, particularly reflective logics and multi-model systems are employed extensively. This research is expected to lead to a new technology for composition, interoperation and dynamic evolution of software systems. It seeks to treat interoperability at many levels and along many dimensions: components, languag es, specifications, formalisms\/logics, and tools. This provides the capacity to move in a mathematically rigorous way across the different formalizations of a system, and to use the different tools supporting these formalizations in a rigorously integrated way. The research is based on two key technical ideas: module calculi (for integration) and open multi-model systems (for interoperation). The module calculus is formalism-independent, and is intended to have powerful new operations such as generalization. Open multi-model systems formalize the multidimensional aspects of independent interoperating parts. ***","title":"Semantic Foundations for Composition and Interoperation of Open Systems","awardID":"9633363","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"1999-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"Y061","name":"DARPA-SRI INTERNATL 97 SEMANTI"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"Y582","name":"DARPA-SEMANTIC FDN FOR COMPOSI"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"Z616","name":"ARPA-EVOLUTIONARY DESIGN COMPL"}}],"PIcoPI":["550264"],"PO":["150697"]},"15088":{"abstract":"This research will formulate and develop a method for controlling the traffic carried on a broadband communication network, specifically for the case of carrying diverse real traffic sources with difficult to model and analyze queueing properties; inter-source correlation; slowly varying statistical properties; diverse heterogeneous source types; mis-specified traffic descriptors; and inadvertent network traffic shaping.

Tradeoffs between system architecture, BiCMOS circuit implementations, cost, power consumption, and performance at different levels will be identified. This research will yield important practical results that form the basis for many wireless communication products, and specifically those to be used for the upcoming personal communication systems (PCS) and in communication over the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) bands. The tradeoffs in building complete wireless communication products in integrated circuit form, versus hybrids (with off-chip components) will be a key component of the proposed research. This work proposed in this proposal encompasses theory, software simulation, and hardware implementations. The uniqueness of the approach is based on the coordinated effort of two groups with proven accomplishments in communications and microelectronics circuits. Heavy interaction between both faculty members and graduate students from the two institutions proposing this project is expected. The Texas A&M University contribution will be in the communication system architectures, multiple-access techniques (i.e. CDMA, TDMA, etc.), signal processing algorithms, mixers, and active and passive filters. The INAOE contribution will be mainly in the BiCMOS circuit design of key building blocks. These blocks include the front-end low noise amplifier (LNA), power amplifiers, channel encoders\/decoders, and correlators. The feasibility and performance of the proposed designs will be verified first by software simulation involving tradeoffs, experimental verification b silicon chip-prototypes of important building blocks, and some system applications resul ts. A successful conclusion of this proposal research will lead to practical, unified design methodologies for designing wireless communication systems, especially those for PCS and unlicensed devices operating in the ISM bands. Contributions at the system, building block, and hardware levels and their interrelations are anticipated. This research will have an important effect on the infrastructure of wireless research and education in our universities, since a significant number of students are already involved. Funding for these students will come not only potentially from the support requested in this proposal, but also from present support, exceeding half a million dollars, from the College of Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering at Texas A&M University, as well as from Texas Instruments, over the next three years.

An experimental demonstration of DNA-based computation by Adleman(a) has changed the view of what computation is, (b) offers the potential for unprecedented computing power at the molecular level, and (c) raises fundamentally new research problems in chemistry, computer science, and material science. This project represents a concerted attack on these problems which involves close collaboration between chemists, material scientists, and computer scientists.(2) This research will help answer two major questions on DNAcomputation. First, does computation at the molecular level have the potential to provide computing power that is orders of magnitude greater than foreseeable extrapolations of current technology? Second, is this type of computation suited to solving NP-hard problems (problems that are well beyond the limits of current technology?(3) The potential for huge computing power rests on the use of DNA strands to encode information and the manipulation of these strands in a massively parallel fashion, involving as many as 2^70 (2 to the 70th power) distinct strands. The premise of this project is that surface-based chemistry is a critical technology in approaching this scale. With this approach, DNA strands are immobilized on a surface, thus allowing a much greater degree of control in chemical processes that manipulate the DNA than is achievable via the test tube based methodology of Adleman. While surfacebased chemistry is the basis for recent strides in combinatorial chemistry, this project is the FIRST to fully exploit surface-based manipulation of DNA strands for the purposes of DNA computation.(4) Scaling up current surface chemistry to approach the requirements of DNA-based computation requires high-quality research at the interface of materials science and chemistry. Improvements in the nanoscale morph ology and chemical makeup of the surface is key to ensuring that a high density of information can be obtained and reliable chemical manipulations performed. Good surface attachment chemistry and control of chemical ``operations'' or enzymatic processes are also extensively developed. This project should result in significant advances in the state of- the-art in surface chemistry and should provide a solid basis for predicting the limits of surfacebased DNA computation.(5) An eventual goal of DNA-based computation is to perform massivelyparallel searches for optimal solutions of NPhard problems. However, the differences between DNAbased computation and conventional technology require that radically new algorithms be developed for this paradigm. Tempering the potential for unprecedented parallelism (up to 2^70 simultaneous operations) is extremely slow and errorprone nature of the operations themselves. Novel strategies for generating and searching solution spaces for NPhard problems are investigated. These strategies embody sound algorithmic principles that can be applied to a range of problems. Using a combination of analysis and simulations, the effectiveness of these strategies are tested on selected applications. This work provides new ways of attacking NPhard problems that, while designed for a hypothetical DNA based computer, are valuable for massively parallel computing paradigms, other than the DNA-based paradigm studied here.(6) Thus this comprehensive program will provide a deep understanding of the potential and limitations of DNAbased computation, from both the chemical and algorithmic viewpoints.***","title":"DNA Computation on Surfaces","awardID":"9613799","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"1999-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4725","name":"EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS\/CADRE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"Y073","name":"DARPA-DNA CONPUTATION OF SURFA"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"Y475","name":"DARPA-DNA COMPUTATION ON SURFA"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"Z796","name":"ARPA-COMPUTATIONAL PROTOTYPING"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0808","name":"Division of BIOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"DBI"},"pgm":{"id":"1107","name":"COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY ACTIVITI"}}],"PIcoPI":["545133"],"PO":["150516"]},"15243":{"abstract":"This project continues the development and implementation of new powerful symbolic algorithms for testing the integrability and the calculation of conservation laws.

Based on scaling properties (symmetries) of the equations, the proposed algorithm provides an elegant way to construct conserved densities and their associated fluxes. Based on homogenization techniques, a second software package will allow the user to compute the analytic form of particular solutions for large classes of PDEs.

While there has been extensive research on designing traffic management algorithms for each individual service, it is unclear how these algorithms can be integrated into one network and how they will interact with each other. This problem becomes more complex when the network also needs to support link-sharing, which allows resource sharing among applications that require different network services but belong to the same administrative class. The service disciplines at the switching nodes, which determine the order in which packets are serviced, play a critical role in controlling the interactions among different traffic streams, different service classes, and different link sharing classes. The hypothetical Fluid Fair Queueing (FFQ) discipline, which can serve multiple traffic streams simultaneously according to pre-specified service shares, provides an ideal framework to integrate traffic management algorithms for different services and link sharing. Since FFQ uses an idealized fluid model that cannot be implemented in the real-world, Packet Fair Queueing (PFQ) algorithms are needed to approximate its behavior. Previously proposed PFQ algorithms including the most popular Weighted Fair Queueing all introduce substantial inaccuracy in approximating FFQ, which significantly affects traffic management and link sharing algorithms. It is unclear whether accurate PFQ's exist, and if they do, whether they can be simple enough to be implementable at high speed. The goal of this research is to demonstrate that accurate and practical PFQ algorithms can be designed and that they provide the foundation for a framework under which traffic management algorithms for different services and link sharing can be supported in an integrated fashion. Aspects treated include (a) the fundamental tradeoff between complexity and accuracy of PFQ algorithms; (b) issues in integrating different traffic management algorithms and link-sharing into one framework and fundamental tradeoffs between accuracy of PFQ algorithms and the efficiency of link-sharing and traffic management algorithms; (d) admission control algorithms for providing end-to-end performance guarantees using PFQ algorithms under not only rate-proportional but also general resource assignments; e) more flexible real-time services such as renegotiated service and rate-adaptive service based on PFQ algorithms. The study is conducted via a combination of analysis, simulation, and implementation.

The realization of Personal Communications Services (PCS) will increase dependence on mobile networks by the mass public and private sectors, implying that system failure resulting in loss of communication or critical data will not be tolerated. Fault tolerance analysis provides an understanding of system functionality in the wake of failures. Fault tolerance analysis such as the reliability, availability, and survivability problems continues to be well researched for wired networks. The mobility of the user along with the unpredictability of motion indicate that models and assumptions for wired networks cannot be carried over to the wireless, mobile domain. Very little focus has yet been placed on fault tolerance analysis for mobile networks in particular. This project fills this void through exploratory research on fault tolerance analysis of systems which provide large-scale PCS, including voice, data and multimedia communications. These systems are comprised of radio frequency communications within mobile cellular or picocellular networks that are interconnected to the existing (wired) infrastructure. The fault tolerance criteria and evaluation approach are not immediately apparent for these systems due to the heterogeneity of the services provided and of the underlying interconnection network, and due to the inherent unreliability of the wireless communications medium. The goal of this project is to formulate the appropriate research problems regarding fault tolerance of mobile systems and to indicate an analysis strategy.

The standard approach to representing this uncertainty is to use probability. While probability has many advantages, there are situations where it seems inappropriate or unnecessary. The long-term goal of this project is to understand to what extent we can maintain the benefits of probability while using more qualitative approaches. The focus is on one measure of belief, called a plausibility measure, where the plausibility of an event is just an element in some partially-ordered space. Plausibility measures generalize the bestknown approaches in the literature, including probability, possibility (based on fuzzy logic), and Dempster-Shafer belief functions. Four main lines of investigation are being pursued: (1) Default reasoning---using plausibility to give semantics to defaults such ``birds typically (or normally) fly''. (2) Belief dynamics---using plausibility to capture an agent's beliefs, and defining an appropriate notion of conditioning to capture how these beliefs change over time. (3) Qualitative decision theory---using plausibility as a basis for a qualitative approach to decision making. (4) Complexity issues---investigating whether qualitative reasoning using plausibility is easier than more quantitative reasoning. This research should help provide tools for a powerful, yet easy-touse, framework for representing uncertainty. It is hoped that a combination of qualitative and quantitative reasoning under uncertainty will be more effective in providing reasoning ability to intelligent agents than either approach used alone. ***","title":"A Qualitative Framework for Reasoning Under Uncertainty","awardID":"9625901","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6856","name":"ARTIFICIAL INTELL & COGNIT SCI"}}],"PIcoPI":["516488"],"PO":["565227"]},"17841":{"abstract":"P.I.:John T. Hackett IBN-9634400 Neurons (nerve cells) in our brains communicate between each other at contact points (synapses) which excite the following neurons by means of chemicals known as transmitters. When things go right, this process of signaling continues repeatedly in an organized way that results in integration of information coming into and leaving the brain. This process also is the basis of memory and learning. The proposed research has as its long range goal to clarify the process by which neurotransmitter substances are released from neurons. At an early stage, the neurotransmitter are packaged in a stored form from which they must be mobilized to dock at the membrane of the release site. To help explain the mobilization process, mathematical calculations will test various possible outcomes that will be compared with experimentally obtain results. Of particular interest is the finding that following repetitive stimulation more and more neurotransmitter substance is release by a process known as facilitation. Understanding how facilitation comes about will be key to our understanding of more complicated forms of memory and learning.","title":"CRI: Statistical Analysis and Computer Simulations of Persistent Neurosecretory Activity","awardID":"9634400","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"1162","name":"COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"1191","name":"BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"1592","name":"PROF OPPOR FOR WOMEN IN RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"5500","name":"NEURAL SYSTEMS CLUSTER"}}],"PIcoPI":["309516",44840,"500159"],"PO":["565284"]},"17621":{"abstract":"The goal of this research is to study, design and evaluate control mechanisms for time-multiplexing optical interconnection networks in multiprocessor applications. Such mechanisms decouple the relatively slow network control from the high optical data transmission bandwidth. The research will assess the advantages, capabilities and limitations of time-division multiplexing. Specifically, models will be developed to specify the communication requirements of applications, to express and measure the communication locality present in communication loads, and to estimate the communication cost in multiplexed interconnection networks. Different control protocols will be simulated and tested on traces collected from actual parallel applications, and on synthetic traces generated with the help of the communication locality model. Centralized, distributed and pipelined control strategies will be implemented and compared. This project is motivated by several observations. First, without multiplexing, the control overhead of establishing end-to-end connections in a network may be prohibitive. Second, applications exhibit communication locality which amplifies the benefits of multiplexing. Third, the high bandwidth of optical paths allows for multiplexing with minimal effect on the transmission rate on individual connections. Finally, the nature of massively parallel programs allows compilers to determine, with current technology, the multiplexing sequences that satisfy most of the communication requirements.","title":"Time Division Multiplexing of Optical Interconnection Networks","awardID":"9633729","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4715","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["533851"],"PO":[44305]},"16532":{"abstract":"Data speculation refers to the execution of instructions before it has been determined that the data being used is valid.

Problems complicating the provision of multicast, feedback-based, real-time video service include (1) implosion of feedback returning to the source as the number of multicast destinations increases, and (2) variance in the amount of available bandwidth on different branches in the multipoint connection. The proposed research addresses and solves the two problems mentioned above by introducing and investigating a new service for real-time multicast video. Multipoint feedback mechanisms are used to adaptively control the transmission rates of each layer of a multi-layered video stream. The proposed service relies on adaptive, multi-layered coding at the video source and closed-loop feedback from the network in order to control the high and low priority video generation rates of the video encoder. It also supports a minimum bandwidth guarantee and the best effort support of video traffic exceeding the minimum rate. To study these mechanisms, mathematical analysis, simulations, and empirical experiments using the ATM testbed network available to the P.I. are employed.","title":"Adaptive Multicast Transport of Realtime Video Over ATM Networks","awardID":"9628109","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"2002-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4091","name":"NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["50854","409909"],"PO":["234222"]},"11780":{"abstract":"This is a 3-year standard award.

This project explores various methods for automated and semi-automated analysis and verification of concurrent and distributed systems. In particular, the research seeks methods based on temporal logic model checking for verification of concurrent systems. Although model checking has been applied fairly successfully for verification of quite a few real-life systems, its applicability to a wider class of practical systems has been hampered by the state explosion problem (i.e. the enormous increase in the size of the state space). In this research, symmetry based techniques are used to overcome the state explosion problem. In particular, symmetry is exploited for verification of liveness properties of real-life concurrent and distributed software systems. The effectiveness of symmetry-based methods for model checking requires efficient solutions to the orbit problem. A solution to the orbit requires checking if two given global states are equivalent under the symmetry. An efficient solution to this problem facilitates the construction of the quotient structure by collapsing each set of equivalent states into a single state. The project investigates various efficient algorithms for the orbit problem for many of the symmetries that occur in practical systems. It is implementing an on-line model checking system that exploits symmetry by simultaneously constructing reduced global state graph (i.e. the quotient structure) and exploring the partially generated quotient structure for existence of certain fair strongly connected components containing an incorrect computation. ***","title":"Formal Methods in Concurrent and Distributed Systems","awardID":"9623229","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"2000-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2890","name":"CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES"}}],"PIcoPI":["550555"],"PO":["150697"]},"12144":{"abstract":"This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's \"Connections to the Internet\" announcement, NSF 96-64.

Issues include bandwidth efficiency, receiver\/transmitter complexity, and quality of service (QoS). Two main research areas within CDMA receiver design will be investigated: multi rate communications and channel equalization. In order to accommodate a variety of potentially disparate sources (voice, data and video signals), multi-rate communication schemes must be developed. Possible sources such as voice, video, and data communications have inherently different QoS requirements. QoS parameters include: bit-rate, allowable delay, performance, and source priority. The constant bit-rate paradigm of the current wireless network will not serve such multi-rate services of the future. The focus of this research is to: (a) develop optimal detectors for the various multi-rate access methods and compared, (b) create performance measures which capture QoS needs will be constructed and (c) construct multi-user receivers to explicitly exploit the redundancy in the mixture of narrowband and wideband user signals. A major consideration is the distortion induced by the propagation effects of the radio channel. Receivers to combat the effects of multipath and fading will be developed and analyzed. While equalization in the context of wireless systems is a well-explored problem, the novelty of this research lies in the consideration of (a) parameter estimation methods necessary for the accommodation of new users, (b) the specialization of existing blind equalization techniques for CDMA signals which are achieved with moderate complexity, and (c) the development of partially blind methods to fully exploit any information present about the CDMA signals and the communication channel.","title":"CAREER: Multi-user Receivers for Advanced Wireless Systems","awardID":"9624375","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4096","name":"COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1100","name":"Division of A\/D FUND","abbr":"A\/D"},"pgm":{"id":"4091","name":"NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["515828"],"PO":["150411"]},"16941":{"abstract":"The biological exploration of the earth has resulted in enormous museum collections. Museum specimens and their associated data document biodiversity and provide vital infrastructure supporting the missions of systematics. Access to collections data is crucial for the rapid progress of systematics and ultimately for the assessment, analysis, and management of biotic resources. U.S. collections are held by more than 150 museums and botanical gardens, and the highly partitioned distribution of collections data among autonomously managed databases impedes their effective use. The unmet need is for technology that enables users to assemble data from distributed sources, while hiding the complexity of data distribution, and the heterogeneity among local systems and schemas. The federated databases model architecture has repeatedly been identified as appropriate for developing information interoperability within the biological sciences. Establishing a federation of collections databases imposes a minimal set of requirements for cooperation within a community. While technical solutions for enabling database interoperability will be developed in the computer science community, the required semantic data standards can only result from efforts arising within and carried out by the collections community. This project is being conducted under the auspices of the Association of Systematics Collections (ASC) Committee on Computerization and Networking, and represents a continuation of an effort on behalf of the systematics community (museums and similar institutions) to develop an information model for biological collections.

The Amazon is a region with one of the world's highest rates of conversion of natural ecosystems to human dominated use. Cattle pasture is the dominant use of deforested lands. Conversion of native forest to pasture causes large changes in the patterns and rates of nutrient cycling and the potential for nutrient losses from soils. Small streams function as key hydrologic and biochemical links between upland soils and downstream aquatic ecosystems. This project will examine soils and streams in small drainage basins in Rondonia, rapidly developing state in the southwest Brazilian Amazon. Four pairs of drainage basins will be compared. One basin in each pair will drain intact forest, the other will drain land that has been cleared and planted to cattle pasture. The availability of nitrogen, phosphorus and major ions will be examined in drainage basin soils. Measurements of streamwater concentrations and forms of nitrogen, phosphorus, major cations and anions, trace elements and suspended sediments in the paired catchments will link changes in soil chemistry with stream biogeochemistry. To determine how long the influence of one land use is maintained as streams pass through one land use to another, the rates at which nutrients are taken up will be determined by measuring solute concentrations upstream and downstream of land use boundaries and by experimental injections of nitrate and phosphate and a non-reactive tracer in forest and pasture streams to determine how biogeochemical inputs from soils in the drainage basin affect stream organic matter production. This work will provide important new information that will help to predict the effect of agricultural development and deforestation. Examination of stream pro ductivity will provide new information on how land use change affects biological functions that maintain water quality and support fisheries that are important to human well-being. On a longer time frame, this project will provide a foundation for future modeling efforts to link land use changes in small watersheds with biogeochemical changes in the larger rivers of the Amazon using models of water routing and within stream biogeochemical processing.

An important aspect of this work is the collaboration with scientists in the biological sciences. Particular emphasis will be placed on the development of computational tools for the detection of multiple repeated regions and tandem repeats in both DNA and protein sequences. These regions are very important as they have been associated with regulatory, stabilizing, and evolutionary sites. Many such repeated regions are difficult to detect because the repetitions are inexact, sometimes exhibiting a low percentage of identical symbols. An analysis will be conducted to gain more insight into the difficult problem of determining the threshold for statistical significance of such repeats. The efficient identification of multiple repeats requires a subtle similarity measure. This will require the identification and representation of optimal as well as near optimal alignments between subsequences. An empirical comparative study will be conducted to assess the applicability and significance of the new algorithms.

Significant benefits are expected from the confluence of these areas of research. Moreover, the capability of reasoning with time is critical to model the dynamics of active databases, and to avoid undesirable rule behavior, such as non-termination.

The research seeks to quantify the impact of fractal traffic characteristics on network performance, building on the present experience with self-similar traffic models. First, the work will extend the understanding of simple single-server models achieved by the PIs and other authors. The effects of complications such as multiple service classes and finite buffer sizes, and the modifications needed when self similarity is only asymptotic (relevant for variable-bit-rate services) will be considered. Second, the effects of connecting a large number of nodes in a network will be investigated including issues such as the robustness of self similarity. Finally, the project will tackle the difficult problems of understanding the transformations induced on self similar traffic by network controls as well as the consequences of self similarity on the effectiveness of the controls themselves. The work will consist of constructing simple models for networks, testing their validity through numerical simulations, and comparing their behavior with experimental measurements from real networks. The behavior of these models will be studied through a combination of numerical and analytical techniques.","title":"Network Performance with Fractal Traffic","awardID":"9628067","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2890","name":"CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4091","name":"NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["551079",40411,40412],"PO":["234222"]},"12992":{"abstract":"","title":"Graduate Research Fellowship Program","awardID":"9616274","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1101","name":"Division of GRADUATE EDUCATION","abbr":"DGE"},"pgm":{"id":"7172","name":"GRADUATE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1101","name":"Division of GRADUATE EDUCATION","abbr":"DGE"},"pgm":{"id":"7175","name":"MINORITY GRADUATE FELLOWSHIPS"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1101","name":"Division of GRADUATE EDUCATION","abbr":"DGE"},"pgm":{"id":"9199","name":"UNDISTRIBUTED PANEL\/IPA FUNDS"}}],"PIcoPI":["33380"],"PO":["235156"]},"11683":{"abstract":"This short-term research project will address the challenge of achieving near PetaOps scale performance within a decade through innovative systems that exhibit wide applicability and ease of use.

This hybrid architecture approach is motivated by the realization that a mix of technologies may yield superior operational attributes to those possible based solely on semiconductor technology in the same time frame. An interdisciplinary team of collaborators has been assembled to conduct the required point-design study in order to devise a complete system structure and evaluate its performance characteristics using a small set of scientific application kernels. The proposed hybrid technology approach exploits critical opportunities enabled by key emerging devices. Specifically computational performance can be dramatically improved through recent advances in Superconducting Rapid Single Flux Quantum logic which will make 100 Ghz clock rates feasible in the next two years. Memory capacity may be drastically increased through a new memory hierarchy, merging advanced semiconductor high density memory and future (admittedly more speculative) optical 3-D holographic storage capable of storing 0.1 Petabits or more.

Secondly, a functional prototype for the entire language is being developed; this prototype can be tested with the validation suite. A set of case studies comparing SQL and TSQL2 solutions utilizes the prototype to provide an evaluation of the practical utility of the language constructs. These artifacts will be made available to the standards bodies and to vendors interested in enabling via their products the development and productions gains made possible with temporal database technology, thereby ensuring a direct transfer of insights from the temporal database research community to industry. ***","title":"Enabling the Commerical Realization of Temporal Databases","awardID":"9632569","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"1998-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}}],"PIcoPI":["560601",43328],"PO":["563751"]},"11871":{"abstract":"Depth images are used as rendering primitives in the high-performance graphics engine that is being constructed in this project. A depth image is a two- dimensional image that includes depth relative to a viewpoint, in addition to color and other properties. From a small number of depth images, each of which represents an arbitrarily complex scene from a single viewpoint, an image can be computed for any viewpoint within the neighborhood of the original viewpoints. This image-based rendering approach offers advantages in realism and distributing the rendering computation among processors that generate depth images and those that reproject them to new viewpoints. The project is using the existing PixelFlow graphics engine to test the image- based rendering ideas. During the first part of the project, algorithms for acquiring and pre-processing depth images will be investigated. At the same time, the PixelFlow machine will be enhanced for image acquisition and storage. This will permit software for image-based rendering to run in real-time on the PixelFlow machine, performing the following operations: determination of reference images to be used as sources of depth pixels, warping of reference image pixels to the screen space, evaluation color, area, and other parameters for each pixel, and blending of pixels to form the final reference image. In later stages of the project, hardware support may be developed and evaluated for some of these operations.","title":"ImageFlow: Real-Time Image-Based Rendering","awardID":"9612643","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"4725","name":"EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS\/CADRE"}}],"PIcoPI":["550455",30185],"PO":["549626"]},"10551":{"abstract":"This award supports a new, multidisciplinary research training program focused on understanding nonlinear processes in biological systems at the level of cells to that of populations and communities.

New firms have sprung up and existing firms from related industries such as entertainment have moved into the IT sector to compete with traditional equipment manufacturers, software firms, and service providers. Advances in network technology and miniaturization of components have led to increasing emphasis on distributed systems and have opened up possibilities of convergence of computing, communications, and entertainment products. These changes have also provided an incentive for corporations to emphasize development of new products and expansion of market share over support of IT research. Combined with fiscal pressures to limit government funded research in all but the most basic types of research, these trends have led to concerns that the United States will have increasing difficulty sustaining the information technology base. The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) will establish a cross-disciplinary study committee to examine trends in R&D for information technology, determine whether a problem exists, and explore options for preserving the research and technology base. In addressing the issue of sources of support for future innovations in IT, the study will examine the changing roles of industry, academia, and government in the IT research enterprise.

The dynamic temporal and spatial distribution of microbes in the unsaturated media above aquifers is essentially unknown; though it is recognized that the distribution can be significantly heterogeneous. Since microbial communities in the unsaturated zone degrade the vast majority of contaminants applied to the earth's surface, this lack in understanding presents profound limitations to our ability to predict or enhance this essential contaminant treatment system. These studies involve the development and application of an analytical methodology that allows for direct, continuous observation of microbial distribution and activity, as well as the transport of contaminants through heterogeneous unsaturated porous media. This is made possible through the unification of two new technologies in an interdisciplinary effort between groundwater hydrology and environmental microbiology, namely: (1) the utilization of bioluminescent microbes to quantify microbial activity and contaminant movement; and (2) the use of light transmission chambers to quantify pore water content, pressure, and hydraulic flow paths. The system employs a naphthalene-degrading bacterium, Pseudomonas flourescens HK44, which has a lux gene cassette inserted into the naphthalene degradation pathway such that light is emitted in direct proportion to the rate of degradation of naphthalene or its metabolite salicylate. These experiments will be carried out in two-dimensional glass-walled flow cells containing packed aquifer sands at two scales: 2 x 1.5 m and 60 x 60 cm. The flow cells provide for controlled aqueous flux, illumination, and continuous time-lapse video and digital CCD imaging of the entire experiment. The effect s of geologic heterogeneity will be studied by packing the chambers with fine over coarse sand textural interfaces. Theses studies will: 1) Determine if regions of heterogeneous microbial colonization develop in otherwise uniform porous media under continuous unsaturated flow conditions. 2) Evaluate the effect of geological heterogeneities (textural variation) on localization of microbial development. 3) Investigate the combined and possibly interacting effects of geological and biological heterogeneities on contaminant fate and transport. 4) Assess the predictive capabilities of present microbial and hydrodynamic theory with respect to the experimental results of this research through the use of numerical models which simulate flow and microbial habitat. These studies will provide a powerful new analytical tool for the scientific and engineering communities to gain understanding of subsurface microbial activity and growth in natural and contaminated sites. The ability to make quantitative non-destructive observations on the rate and position of microbial activity, while monitoring water content and pressure, will significantly increase the capability to exploit microbial degradation toward environmental bioremediation. ***","title":"Quantitative Lux-Based Assessment of Interacting Microbial Activity and Vadose Hydrology","awardID":"9630293","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"06","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES             ","abbr":"GEO"},"div":{"id":"0603","name":"Division of EARTH SCIENCES","abbr":"EAR"},"pgm":{"id":"1584","name":"ENVIRO GEOCHEM AND BIOGEOCHEM"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0801","name":"Division of ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY","abbr":"DEB"},"pgm":{"id":"1181","name":"ECOSYSTEM STUDIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0807","name":"Division of MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIE","abbr":"MCB"},"pgm":{"id":"1154","name":"GENE EXPRESSION"}}],"PIcoPI":["42938","309879","492366",41859],"PO":["473761"]},"15227":{"abstract":"9625374 Aho, Alfred Columbia University CISE Research Infrastructure: Scalable Multimedia Information Processing This award is for the creation of a computer infrastructure that will enable realistic and practical demonstrations for future computing environments.

Second, it will provide exciting empirically-derived models and theories of dynamic phenomena such as communities and organizations in very large scale electronic environments. The phenomena uncovered in the data alone can serve as valuable tests of and challenges to existing models derived from analysis, simulation, or extrapolation from smaller- scale models.

The challenge in this domain is to perform realistic physical simulation in real time of multiple actors (some real and some synthetic), each with several degrees of freedom. This research will investigate the system architecture issues in the design of parallel (cluster) servers engineered with commodity processing and network components for supporting such applications. A shared address space across the cluster is an attractive abstraction from the perspective of programming such applications. However, accessing and caching data from this shared address space can be expensive in terms of observed latencies in a cluster. Therefore, clever techniques that hide the communication overheads for accessing the shared address space are imperative to achieving good performance. The ultimate goals is to make the cluster server appear as though the applications incur zero overhead for communication. Specific research issues to be addressed in this research include (a) mechanisms for realizing shared address space across the cluster, (b) mechanisms for supporting variable granularity, caching, explicit communication, and synchronization (within the framework of shared space) tailored to the needs of these applications, (c) hardware assists necessary to make clusters appealing as cost-effective parallel machines, and (d) detailed performance evaluations of cluster servers under such multimedia and database workloads.","title":"The Quest for a Zero Overhead Parallel Machine","awardID":"9630145","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4715","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["564690"],"PO":[41774]},"17857":{"abstract":"9634475 Astrachan, Owen Rodger, Susan Duke University CISE Educational Innovation: Curious - (C)enter for (U)ndergraduate Education and (R)esearch: (I)ntegration Thr(OU)gh Performance and Vi(S) ualization This CISE Educational Innovation award supports the integration of research into the undergraduate curriculum through the themes of performance evaluation and measurement and visualization by developing software, assignments and instructional support.

This exploratory effort should show the way to the formulation of the more general questions for design such as how the kinematic constraints as well as tool and system maintenance procedure availability can be accommodated in design and planning.Incorporation of such knowledge in the original design process could also facilitate human performance of disassembly operations in some cases.","title":"SGER: A Human-Centered System for Virtual Part Disassembly and Replacement","awardID":"9615689","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"1998-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["179262"],"PO":["475621"]},"12852":{"abstract":"","title":"Graduate Research Fellowship Program","awardID":"9616031","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0705","name":"Division of ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND CENT","abbr":"EEC"},"pgm":{"id":"1360","name":"HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1101","name":"Division of GRADUATE EDUCATION","abbr":"DGE"},"pgm":{"id":"7172","name":"GRADUATE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1101","name":"Division of GRADUATE EDUCATION","abbr":"DGE"},"pgm":{"id":"9199","name":"UNDISTRIBUTED PANEL\/IPA FUNDS"}}],"PIcoPI":["33380"],"PO":["235156"]},"11774":{"abstract":"A remote evaluation system is characterized by a client that sends a program to a compute server for execution on its behalf. The server returns to the client the results of executing the program. This is in contrast to RPC and CGI scripts which are examples of server-side programs, not remote evaluation. Remote evaluation appears to be gaining currency as evidenced by new programming languages emerging to support it. Among them are Telescript, Tcl, Oblique and Java. The download-and-execute paradigm supported by Java and Java- compatible Web browsers is an example of remote evaluation; in this case, however, a Web server sends a Java-enhanced HTML file to a browser which the browser then executes. Server security is a major problem with remote evaluation. A server's availability, privacy and integrity must not be compromised. Current techniques for ensuring server security is ad hoc. There is no precise characterization of what kind of security properties these techniques can guarantee. Consequently, the typical reaction is to limit, or in most cases prohibit altogether, an application's access to server resources. This greatly weakens the remote evaluation paradigm. This research investigates the role of programming language design and type systems in ensuring the security of servers in remote evaluation systems. Specifically, the long-term objective is to develop static analyses, within the context of type systems, to ensure that remotely-evaluated programs do not violate a server's privacy or integrity. Type soundness theorems are being developed and proved with respect to a formal semantics for a core imperative language. They precisely characterize the security properties of well-typed programs written in the language. The impact of features such as concurrency and exceptions in a programming language on security properties is also investigated. ***","title":"Type Systems for Secure Remote Evaluation","awardID":"9612345","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}}],"PIcoPI":["99877"],"PO":["150697"]},"14920":{"abstract":"The continued growth and expanded applications in engineering, economics, and sciences have greatly increased the need for advanced computational methods for solving some highly complex nonlinear complementary problems and variational inequalities.

First, the cost of the very highest end machines lies far beyond the point where widespread deployment is feasible, and second (and more critical) the software environments for these machines are awkward at best, and capable of eking out only fractions of the performance that the hardware is capable of supplying. The thesis of this is that much of the problem stems from our historical separation of memory and CPU logic parts. Individual CPU clock rates and internal architectures continue to accelerate, and thus require ever increasing amounts of bandwidth from the memory subsystem. These rates have far exceeded the bandwidth capabilities of our densest DRAM memory parts (needed to control system costs), and the gap will widen over time. The net effect is complex memory hierarchies, which in turn drives cost and software complexity in addressing these hierarchies efficiently. A new technology is emerging to counter this fundamental defect: the combination on one chip of both dense DRAM and very significant amounts of logic. This capability permits new architectures termed Processing-In-Memory (PIM) to place computing either right next to, or even inside of, the memory macros, where there are huge amounts of raw bandwidth. The first such chip, EXECUBE, integrated onto a 4Mbit DRAM chip 8 complete CPUs configured in a 3D binary hypercube, and was capable of being used as a one chip-type building block for MPPs of both MIMD and SIMD organization. The objective of this project is to look at utilizing PIM technology potentials over the next decade and demonstrate that they promise efficient solution. The approach to be used involves configuring and studying some \"point design\" MPPs with 100 tera(fl)op potential for several interesting classes of problems, and then utilizing the novel features of these architectures, along with matching system software and software development tools, to attack them in ways that may permit not only exceptional performance, but also greatly simplified programming environments.","title":"PDS: Pursuing a Petaflop: Point Designs for 100TF Computers Using PIM Technologies","awardID":"9612028","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"1997-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"01","name":"Office of OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR                  ","abbr":"O\/D"},"div":{"id":"0111","name":"Office of CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"OCI"},"pgm":{"id":"4080","name":"ADVANCED COMP RESEARCH PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"Z736","name":"NASA-POINT DESIGN"}}],"PIcoPI":[29637,"507932","456490","518029","336016"],"PO":["98501"]},"12105":{"abstract":"The Community College of Philadelphia requests support from NSF to connect its campus to the Internet.

A simple two-dimensional structure is proposed for the complete system, where the aforementioned one-dimensional BB is extended into two dimensions. With readily available technology, the word-wide optical interconnection network can be viewed as a mesh of relatively short plastic bars to which interfaces to processor cards are attached. Each processor card contains eight processors interconnected locally with an electronic crossbar. Taking advantage of higher-speed optical technologies, all eight processors share the same optical interface to the two-dimensional system. Its high-level architecture is also scaleable, because it can be extended straight forwardly for any number of dimensions larger than two.","title":"PDS: A Scalable-Feasible Parallel Computer Implementing Electronic and Optical Interconnections for 156 TeraOPS Minimum Performance","awardID":"9634775","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"1998-11-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"01","name":"Office of OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR                  ","abbr":"O\/D"},"div":{"id":"0111","name":"Office of CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"OCI"},"pgm":{"id":"4080","name":"ADVANCED COMP RESEARCH PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"Z665","name":"ARPA-NEW MILLENIUM"}}],"PIcoPI":["217710","560438","260816"],"PO":["179296"]},"14459":{"abstract":"This is a joint project between Dimitri Bertsekas, MIT and Andrea Goldsmith, Caltech. The scarcity of channel capacity to support emerging multimedia wireless applications requires efficient strategies for using the available bandwidth. Any system using fixed frequency reuse and base station assignment must be designed relative to worst-case interference assumptions. Dynamic resource allocation is a more efficient strategy, where frequencies, base stations, data rates, and power levels are dynamically assigned relative to current and potential system conditions. In this work, we propose to formulate the general resource allocation problem as an optimization problem subject to interference constraints. The cost function is very general. It can incorporate most of the practical systems complexity in the optimization framework, including cell handoff due to user mobility, multiple classes of traffic, and channel variation. We consider both FDMA and CDMA methods of dividing up the available systems band width. We will apply linear programming to minimize the instantaneous cost function, and dynamic programming techniques to minimize the cost function over the infinite horizon. The dynamic problem formulation will utilize recent developments in neuro-dynamic programming techniques.","title":"Resource Allocation in Cellular Communication Systems","awardID":"9622636","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4091","name":"NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["364574"],"PO":["125800"]},"17858":{"abstract":"9634485 Glinert, Ephraim Champagne, Matthew Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute CISE Educational Innovation: A Distributed Collaborative Learning Environment for Effective Intellectual Teamwork Across the Curriculum.

As bugs are isolated and fixed, capabilities are added or enhanced in response to changes in the user requirements, and support software and hardware is upgraded or replaced, there are myriad opportunities for invalidation of prior assumptions used in code development. In this project, techniques from logic, type theory, and abstract interpretation are employed in the design and implementation of tools to help automate the process of ensuring consistency. A partial-evaluation-driven abstract-interpretation algorithm is used to analyze individual modules for consistency with respect to local specifications, and a linking and configuration manager will be used to check for correspondence between module specifications. Using abstract interpretation, proof generation, and realizability techniques, the manager synthesizes common additional code that may be needed to provide trustworthy linkages. Two aspects of this approach are essential for application to large-scale, evolving systems: (i)link updating must be a local process, so that small changes do not incur large penalties, and (ii)linkage information must be available to the programmer in a user-readable format.

However, the process of arriving at a classification involves decisions about how to reconcile multiple tree solutions, how to visualize data changes on phylogenetic tree topologies, how to represent conflicts among solutions based on different data sets and finally, methods for presenting these results in publishable form. The field of scientific visualization specializes in the development of visual display techniques to reveal (1) patterns and structure within a data set, and (2) patterns and structure between data sets. The phylogenetic tree, or cladogram, is an example of type (1) visualization because it reveals the relationships among taxa within a single data set. Type (2) visualizations instead focus upon the simultaneous presentation of multiple data sets or multiple representations of the same data set. Within this proposal we outline a series of highly visual, data driven methods for data inspection, simultaneous multiple tree visualization, evaluation of assumptions about the analysis (e.g., choice of root taxon), presentation techniques for hierarchical data and methods for linking, through the World Wide Web (WWW), phylogenetic trees to the data that generated the result(s). Few or none of these techniques are in current use in systematics, in fact, they represent very recent research within computer science. We -believe that the richness and complexity of phylogenetic analysis invites new methods for visualizing the analytical process. MacClade Maddison92 , a Macintosh program for visualizing data change on a single tree, enhanced our understanding of the how character changes occurred on single tree topologies. We will expand that type of analysis to include far richer visual metaphors for viewing the da ta matrix to phylogeny pathway. The research we are proposing is exploratory and by design we will investigate methods that may not prove fruitful for all data sets. However, the applicability of these methods for other forms of hierarchical data makes the likelihood high that some or even most of the visualization tools will assist researchers in all areas of comparative biology. In addressing the visualization problem, the assumptions--a 2D, static medium, Euclidean drawing space, separate figures, data and explanations and homogeneous levels of detail in single illustrations--implicit in current tree visualization techniques must be re-examined. We envision that as electronic journals become ever more prominent in all-areas of science the need will exist for display techniques optimized to on-line viewing. This research should provide significant insight into means for displaying classifications and systematic analyses within this new medium. Although a large number of the specific deliverables for this research will be \"backend\" programs for creating the visualizations .and database architectures for storing trees and data, we will provide access to the entire suite of technologies through WWW browsers (by mid-1996, browsers for all major workstation and PC platforms should incorporate the capability for viewing these results). Users will be able to input and store trees and NEXUS (a standard file format for phylogenetic data) data matrices for subsequent analysis, all within their browser.","title":"Three Dimensional Visualization Methods for Phylogenetic Data","awardID":"9630313","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"1999-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0808","name":"Division of BIOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"DBI"},"pgm":{"id":"1107","name":"COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY ACTIVITI"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0808","name":"Division of BIOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"DBI"},"pgm":{"id":"1165","name":"ADVANCES IN BIO INFORMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["553725"],"PO":["564079"]},"14812":{"abstract":"9623614 Thompson, William University of Utah CISE Research Infrastructure: Modeling Complex Physical and Computational Environment This award is for the creation of a Modeling and Simulation Support Facility, constituting vital infrastructure for work on end user applications in novel computer architectures, manufacturing and design, process control, teleoperations, and medicine; while also serving as a testbed for innovations in machine architecture, hardware, and software systems.

Modern simulations produce large quantities of data, the interpretation of which may not be immediately apparent. Thus, the second central component of the Modeling Facility is a large capacity storage management system. Finally, the Modeling Facility will be equipped with several special purpose devices that can exploit the communications and data management facilities to tackle large-scale problems that are currently infeasible in a traditional academic computing environment.","title":"Supplement: CISE Research Infrastructure: Modeling Complex Physical and Computational Environments","awardID":"9623614","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["560997"],"PO":["150490"]},"12304":{"abstract":"*** 9614443 Cohen With the recent dynamic expansion of the National and Global Information Infrastructures, the activities of larger, more diverse communities are becoming integrated. Because of this, there is great need to understand how trust develops among people acting together in computer-mediated ways. This project will empirically investigate how people generate and maintain trust in task groups working within networked, computer-mediated environments. It will compare results from face-to-face experimental conditions, with results obtained from groups working via networked computers that provide \"desktop conferencing\" video connections, and results on groups working via the World Wide Web without video support. Two significant products are expected. First, the research will provide valuable experimental evidence on whether and how computer mediation affects the development of trust as work groups learn task routines. Second, it will provide extensive development and demonstration of new tools and methods for the conduct of scientific experiments on the integration and impacts of information technology via the World Wide Web.

Previous research has established the theoretical foundation for the statistical analysis of MPL estimation with a general nonlinear probability model and provided a very useful information theoretic connection. The inclusion of the dependent data in the framework allows addressing of problems in coding and modulation in the presence of sources and channels with memory. This research includes development of a new class of realtime adaptive signal processing algorithms based on MPL estimation by using gradient optimization and information theoretic alternating projections, and the study of their statistical and dynamic properties and implementations in specific communications applications such as equalization in long distance optical fiber communications and voiced\/unvoiced\/transition classification in variable rate speech coding. Another important part of the effort is the investigation of the choices for the conditional probability model within the MPL framework, for which, along with other nonlinear models, such as polynomials, finite normal mixtures, and neural networks, piecewise linear models are used to provide a highly desirable compromise between the approximation ability of nonlinear structures and the efficiency and theoretical accessibility of the linear domain to develop new adaptive algorithms.

Canopy communities are poorly understood, partly due to access problems and partly due to a lack of expertise and software tools to analyze complex three-dimensional tree crown data. The PIs propose an interdisciplinary effort to develop database systems to manage, analyze, and disseminate shared data pertaining to complex ecological questions using forest canopy data. The demonstration project will be carried about among seven cooperating but independent researchers at a forest canopy research site, the Wind River Canopy Research Facility in Washington State. Data from existing projects that focus at different spatial and temporal scales will be linked to allow efficient use of site data and to solve novel questions that could not be addressed by a single researcher's data sets. The resulting database management tools will allow researchers to easily gain access to site- specific data and each others' data, which will enhance the productivity both of the individual scientists and of the site as a whole. The initial research focus will be on the development of data models and prototype data structures and data sets for one concurrent study of forest canopy structure and hydrology. That research examines the role of forest canopies in intercepting, modifying, retaining, and conducting water from atmospheric sources (rain, mist, snow) to the forest floor. Forest canopy structure has obvious implications in these processes, but the complexity and three-dimensional nature of forest canopies (especially those of old-growth, structurally complex forests) has prevented ecologists from gaining a quantified understanding of the patterns and processes underlying these interactions. The PI will also continue refining the two database browsers for the Wind River Site data and will extend the data model for those browsers to show the connection with the canopy structure and hydro logy model. Development of a sound data model will allow forest canopy scientists to organize, visualize, and analyze their data in powerful ways. It will also provide the means to link forest canopy structural data with relevant environmental data sets (such as meteorological data) and with other forest functional data sets (e.g., photosynthesis of canopy organisms).","title":"Database Tools for Analyzing Forest Canopy Information","awardID":"9630316","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0808","name":"Division of BIOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"DBI"},"pgm":{"id":"1165","name":"ADVANCES IN BIO INFORMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["483300","528534","474015","537156"],"PO":["565136"]},"17508":{"abstract":"A formal method consists of a well-defined specification language and a rigorously defined set of rules that can be used to reason about the specifications expressed in that language.

In a videocamera, the photodetectors can only operate over a limited range of light levels, so in order to be able to record in bright daylight and dim internal light, the signal must be re-scaled to stay within a limited range of intensities. A slightly smarter system, used in more expensive devices, is to change the gain (how much the signal is amplified) separately in each local region. Changing the amount of gain in an adaptive manner allows signals to be extracted from ambient noise. The same principles of gain control act in our visual system-- in a simple manner on the pupil to control light entering the eye, but in increasingly more sophisticated ways as one goes to higher levels in the visual cortex. Our goal is to investigate these mechanisms of cortical gain control to better understand how the visual sytem works, and as a means of uncovering new image processing applications. The cortex has the ability to control gain not only based on spatial location, but also in a context-dependent manner. The response to a particular feature, say a short line segment, depends upon what other features are present in the image. If the line segment forms part of a circle or an extended line, the response is increased. Psychophysical studies have identified the conditions under which certain features \"pop-out\" and become the focus of visual attention. Recent physiological studies have shown that cortical cells are exquisitely sensitive to small changes in the context of the scene. It is believed that response changes are a result of a change in gain of individual cortical cells, but the mechanisms controlling cell gain are poorly understood. We are particularly interested in differential changes of gain among different cells in a neural population. Most features are represented, in the cortex, by a set of graded responses ove r a population of cells. The orientation of a line, for example, is coded by a distribution of responses over cells that prefer various orientations (vertical, horizontal, oblique). We hypothesize that inputs from stimuli in the visual image act to differentially change the gain of cells. A differential change in gain across a population would lead to increased sensitivity--a better estimate of line orientation, or whatever feature is being analyzed. This type of context-dependent gain control could lead to enhanced discrimination of the salient features in an image. We will carry out a series of physiological experiments in cat visual cortex to investigate this hypothesis. We also will conduct a set of computer simulations of various cellular mechanisms to test our model. Finally, we will build a prototype image processing device, based on these findings, and apply it to real images.","title":"CRI: Context-Dependent Mechanisms for Cortical Gain Control","awardID":"9634367","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"1999-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"5500","name":"NEURAL SYSTEMS CLUSTER"}}],"PIcoPI":[44808,"96414"],"PO":["565284"]},"5470":{"abstract":"Software systems keep growing in size and complexity. Our reliance on such systems is likewise increasing, making it critical that they obey the properties their designers intended. Because these properties are global, their consideration cannot be left to the implementation of modules; rather, they must be ensured by design early on. Achieving critical properties thus depends on being able to analyze designs, so that the consequences of design choices can be explored without the cost of implementation, and potentially disastrous flaws can be caught while their repair is still relatively cheap. Analysis methods based on formal, rather than informal, techniques are amenable to mechanical reasoning. Formal methods have had a dramatic impact in hardware verification -- principally due to the success of model checking -- and are being adopted by industry. In software development, on the other hand, formal methods have not yet had the same impact. This is largely because little tool support has been available. Almost any analysis of a software specification seems to require theorem proving. Theorem proving is not feasible for most software developments, since it requires highly skilled proof experts, and cannot be automated fully. Without automatic analysis, formal specification is much less attractive to practitioners. This project has two aspects. First, it investigates the application of model checking techniques to software. This involves both the identification of appropriate abstract representations of large systems, along with the properties they should obey, and the invention of new abstraction techniques to relate such representations to software designs. The abstraction techniques pursued in this research arise in three ways: (1) from the form of the property to be checked (for example, merging states to preserve a universally quantified property); (2) from the application area (for example, not distinguishing the varieties of failure in a distribu ted system); and (3) from the application itself (for example, abstracting the data held in cache lines in the evaluation of a cache protocol). Second, new checking techniques are being developed for specifications that are not currently well served by model checking. Software designs often involve operations on complex data structures that are defined implicitly. In this case, there is no apparent model to be checked; rather, it is necessary to generate models from the specification and determine whether they satisfy intended properties. The project is developing a language, NP, that is roughly a subset of the Z specification language, and a checker, Nitpick, that can both simulate the execution of operations specified implicitly and check inductive properties of operations, by generating models of a relational formula. While emphasizing principles that are expected to find broader application, the project is driven by realistic case studies: railway switching, telephone features, and security protocols. ***","title":"Model Checking of Software Systems","awardID":"9523972","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"1999-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2890","name":"CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES"}}],"PIcoPI":["335202","475099"],"PO":["150697"]},"12922":{"abstract":"","title":"Graduate Research Fellowship Program","awardID":"9616151","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0705","name":"Division of ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND CENT","abbr":"EEC"},"pgm":{"id":"1360","name":"HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1101","name":"Division of GRADUATE EDUCATION","abbr":"DGE"},"pgm":{"id":"7172","name":"GRADUATE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1101","name":"Division of GRADUATE EDUCATION","abbr":"DGE"},"pgm":{"id":"7175","name":"MINORITY GRADUATE FELLOWSHIPS"}}],"PIcoPI":["33380"],"PO":["235156"]},"11712":{"abstract":"This is a Research Planning Grant. The research goal is to increase the domain of applicability of fuzzy reasoning by developing a methodology to advance the use of fuzzy reasoning in applications very different from control. Although a consensus has developed on the most useful fuzzy reasoning methods for fuzzy control, these methods do not have widespread applicability to general knowledge based systems. The success seen in fuzzy logic control can be extended to general knowledge base applications by tackling the limitations of the conventional fuzzy reasoning methods. Two of these limitations are the restriction that base rules must be compact for fuzzy reasoning to succeed and the focus on rule-based knowledge representation. It is intended that the first limitation will be eased by developing and testing a new method of fuzzy reasoning based on geometric principles, utilizing the proximity of the input and the rule antecedent to produce an output that has the same proximity with the consequent, and thus can operate in both compact and sparse rule bases. To deal with the second limitation, methods of shifting fuzzy reasoning from rule-based to object-based or frame-based knowledge representations will be explored. Based on the results of this work, further projects will be designed to realize the goal of extending fuzzy logic to general knowledge based systems.","title":"Extending Fuzzy Reasoning to General Knowledge Base Systems","awardID":"9612171","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"1998-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6856","name":"ARTIFICIAL INTELL & COGNIT SCI"}}],"PIcoPI":[29775],"PO":["54008"]},"10403":{"abstract":"9601874 Kriz, Ronald Abrams, Mark Virginia Polytechnic Institute Academic Research Infrastructure: Acquisition of a CAVE: Breaking Research and Education Barriers by Developing 3-D Visualization CAVE Technology This Academic Research Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of a virtual environment laboratory incorporating the CAVE immersive virtual reality system.

The research is broadly classified into the following parts: architectures (single node architecture, parallel architecture), system software (languages, compilers, programming tools and environments), algorithms (design models, performance and scalability) , and applications (scaling and realizable performance). Single node architectures for future generation computers will exploit considerable implicit parallelism. Candidate technologies for single node architectures include super-scalar execution, very long instruction words, simultaneous hardware multithreading, and processors-in-memory. The PIs propose a processor architecture based on the VLIW with possible implementations using PIMs. Parallel architectures are based on clusters of these nodes in a hierarchical network. Due to the large number of computational units, algorithm design and scalability issues become critical. Hierarchical decomposition of problems with an emphasis on proper mapping to the underlying architecture is necessary. Whereas problems at higher levels must be loosely coupled, they can be very tightly coupled at lower levels. Alternate algorithm design methodologies and abstract machine models must be constructed. Finally, the scope of applications that can effectively use these architectures needs to be identified. This research will perform a study of each of these aspects of future generation computers. The PIs expect to draw heavily from their experience in the design of scalable parallel algorithms and architectures and from the CEDAR project.","title":"PDS: Architecture, Algorithms and Applications for Future Generation Supercomputers","awardID":"9634719","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"1997-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"01","name":"Office of OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR                  ","abbr":"O\/D"},"div":{"id":"0111","name":"Office of CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"OCI"},"pgm":{"id":"4080","name":"ADVANCED COMP RESEARCH PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"Z665","name":"ARPA-NEW MILLENIUM"}}],"PIcoPI":["501195","563608"],"PO":["98501"]},"7253":{"abstract":"9531385 Antsaklis This is a request for block international travel funds for the 35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) to be held in Kobe, Japan from December 11th to 13th, 1996.

These algorithms will incorporate scattering models based upon a Green's function formulation of the vector Helholtz equation. A statistically-based, multi-grid-type algorithm for extracting image and target information (number of targets, locations, and classifications) is being developed. The incorporation of detailed, physical models directly into the data processing algorithms makes these techniques directly applicable to a wide range of problems including radar signal processing for image formation and target detection\/classification, remote sensing, microwave medical imaging, and geophysical exploration.","title":"CAREER: An Integrated Approach to the Study of Inverse Methods in Electrical Engineering","awardID":"9623721","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["561951"],"PO":["564898"]},"14507":{"abstract":"The objective of this proposal is to investigate a new technique for finding the implicit equation of a rational surface. Standard implicitization techniques for rational surfaces are based on resultants. But resultants vanish in the presence of base points. Therefore, when base points are present, the implicit equation can be recovered using resultants only by carefully perturbing the parametric equations to eliminate the base points. But such perturbations generally introduce extraneous factors, which then need to be painstakingly removed. Thus base points seriously complicate implicitization using resultants. On the other hand, base points simplify the implicit equation of a rational surface by lowering its degree. Preliminary work has roughed out a new implicitization technique based on algebraic \"moving surfaces\" that \"follow\" a rational surface. Not only is this new implicitization technique impervious to base points, it also simplifies in the presence of base points. Moreover this new method generates a more compact matrix representation for the implicit equation than methods based on resultants. Currently this new method is substantiated only by several Mathematica examples and some preliminary theorems. It is proposed to develop the theoretical foundations of the new method and then to apply the method to solve a variety of practical problems in computer graphics, geometric modeling, and symbolic computation. A wide variety of additional problems in elimination theory might also be attacked by these new techniques including, but not limited to, inverting a rational map, computing the singular locus of a rational surface, intersecting rational curves and surfaces, and intersecting algebraic curves and surfaces. ***","title":"Implicitization of Rational Surfaces with Base Points","awardID":"9622768","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"1997-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4715","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["109667"],"PO":["187585"]},"17808":{"abstract":"The research introduces a novel axial representation of two- and three-dimensional shapes that implements Binford's original notion of ribbons and generalized cylinders for generic objects.

Current resource allocation mechanisms for network-based multipoint information delivery are static in nature and cannot support interactivity for each participant. Point-to-point approaches can support interactivity but are inefficient for scaling to a large number of participants. Currently, no techniques have demonstrated the ability to renegotiate and scale service parameters per session in progress as required to adapt to differing terminal equipment characteristics and network congestion. The proposal addresses this problem through the definition of decomposable service groups that permit aggregation of interactivity, terminal characteristics, and levels of service scaling. Interactivity implies the availability of a unique service group. A mechanism is proposed to dynamically reassign elements to service groups based on changing interactivity and session requirements. Such a mechanism will allow the adjustment of service quality based on cost, available resources, or user-equipment characteristics, and will adapt to changing network loading. The proposed approach applies the characteristics of end applications and data storage requirements to the design of a data scaling mechanism. Specific tasks of this research are to (1) formalize a model for characterizing and aggregating service groups, (2) develop a protocol for dynamic service aggregation, (3) identify a mapping for application requirements to service groups and network quality of service, (4) the establishment of a network access mechanism to support service degradation and scaling for multiple sessions, and (5) the simulation, implementation, and evaluation using established multipoint applications and multicast protocols.","title":"Dynamic Service Aggregation for Interactive Information Delivery","awardID":"9523958","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2890","name":"CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4091","name":"NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["371069"],"PO":["125800"]},"10823":{"abstract":"This workshop will help to communicate to the research community current planning within the government regarding the program component area as well as ellicit valuable input from the research community regarding promising research directions in the area.

The server returns to the client the results of executing the program. This is in contrast to RPC and CGI scripts which are examples of server-side programs, not remote evaluation. Remote evaluation appears to be gaining currency as evidenced by new programming languages emerging to support it. Among them are Telescript, Tcl, Oblique and Java. The download-and-execute paradigm supported by Java and Java-compatible Web browsers is an example of remote evaluation; in this case, however, a Web server sends a Java-enhanced HTML file to a browser which the browser then executes. Server security is a major problem with remote evaluation. A server's availability, privacy and integrity must not be compromised. Current techniques for ensuring server security is ad hoc. There is no precise characterization of what kind of security properties these techniques can guarantee. Consequently, the typical reaction is to limit, or in most cases prohibit altogether, an application's access to server resources. This greatly weakens the remote evaluation paradigm. This research investigates the role of programming language design and type systems in ensuring the security of servers in remote evaluation systems. Specifically, the long-term objective is to develop static analyses, within the context of type systems, to ensure that remotely-evaluated programs do not violate a server's privacy or integrity. Type soundness theorems are being developed and proved with respect to a formal semantics for a core imperative language. They precisely characterize the security properties of well-typed programs written in the language. The impact of features such as concurrency and exceptions in a programming language on security properties is also investigated. ***","title":"Type Systems for Secure Remote Evaluation","awardID":"9612176","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"1999-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}}],"PIcoPI":["528350"],"PO":["561889"]},"14937":{"abstract":"While the Fourier transform is an indispensable tool in signal processing and linear time-invariant (LTI) systems analysis, as well as a staple of the electrical engineering education, many natural and man-made processes are not time-invariant but rather exhibit frequencies that change over time (e.g., FM communication systems, the Doppler effect, speech and other biomedical signals). The conventional short-time, or \"quasi-stationary,\" extensions of LTI concepts for studying such processes is often inadequate; for example, depending upon the short-time analysis interval length selected, dramatically different results can be obtained for the same process, particularly when the signal contains both transients and harmonics. Accordingly, there is a need, both in engineering practice and pedagogy, for the development of new methods for time- varying (or nonstationary) signal processing. This research involves the development and application of a general method of nonstationary signal processing that surmounts the limitations of methods based on the extension of LTI concepts to time-varying situations.

This will provide valuable insight for future Internet extensions to other remote areas that have priority for U.S. research activities.","title":"Mongolia Wireless Field Tests","awardID":"9616007","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"1997-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["201347"],"PO":["63644"]},"12848":{"abstract":"","title":"Graduate Research Fellowship Program","awardID":"9616026","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":[32595],"PO":["235156"]},"15708":{"abstract":"This project will investigate the following problems: (1) Determine explicit bounds involving primitive roots and Artin's conjecture that are useful in the analysis of several number-theoretic algorithms under the assumption of the extended Riemann hypothesis.

The notion here is to develop CAD tools which are, themselves, formally verified and guaranteed to synthesize correct designs. This eliminates the need for designers to master application of formal methods. The aim is to produce code running on an embedded processor and custom hardware on field programmable gate arrays. The tools are designed to partition a design into hardware and software components, to generate microprocessor code, and to do high-level synthesis. Verification is done by providing semantic models for the representation languages used in the system (behavioral specification, register- transfer level description, gate-level circuit, machine code) and proving that the tools produce designs whose meanings are refinements of the meanings of their specifications. Theoretical and practical classroom courses which compliment this research are being developed.","title":"Formally Verified, Efficient Tools for High-Level Synthesis and Hardware-Software Codesign","awardID":"9623604","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4710","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2890","name":"CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":["397025"],"PO":["562984"]},"14818":{"abstract":"9623632 Naughton, Jeffrey Larus, James University of Wisconsin CISE Research Infrastructure: MIDSHIP: Managing Image Data for Scalable High Performance This award is for the acquisition of a cluster of shared-memory processors (SMPs) to support the MIDSHIP project of research into enabling technologies for large-scale mining of image data sets.

This integration should not be interpreted as \"adult education,\" nor as giving children \"jobs;\" rather, it frames a vision in which people learn continually in the course of authentic, self-directed, and creative activities. Central to this vision is the notion of design activity, a model of work that is open-ended and long-term in nature, incorporates personalized and collaborative aspects, and combines technical and aesthetic elements. The communality that crucially binds design activities together is that they are centered around the production of new, publicly accessible artifacts. Our proposal is focused around a vision of how education and work may be seen as interwoven elements of creative design activity. We offer six specific hypotheses as vehicles to attain and sustain this vision, and we present a framework for computational domain-oriented design environment that reflect these hypotheses and offer a means to assess them. The research will develop theories about lifelong learning, will create computational environments necessary to support lifelong learners, will contribute to the restructuring of our national educational infrastructure, and will provide a unique opportunity for extending not only technological developments but also the societal networks of working, learning and collaborating. ***","title":"Lifelong Learning - Bringing Learning Activities to Life","awardID":"9631396","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1109","name":"Division of RESEARCH ON LEARNING","abbr":"DRL"},"pgm":{"id":"7256","name":"RSCH IN EDUCATION, POLICY, PRA"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1109","name":"Division of RESEARCH ON LEARNING","abbr":"DRL"},"pgm":{"id":"7257","name":"APPLICATS OF ADVANCED TECHNOLS"}}],"PIcoPI":["483372","483373","523483","561255"],"PO":["527266"]},"6576":{"abstract":"Rapid prototyping systems composed of programmable gate arrays present many technical challenges affecting system utilization and performance. The objective of this research is the development of engineering methodologies which address these currently unresolved technical issues. Current rapid prototyping systems suffer several shortcomings, including engineering bottlenecks caused by time- consuming mapping processes, inadequate performance for real-time emulation of high-speed systems, and high cost resulting from poor system utilization due to the severe IO limit of programmable devices. The proposed research targets these key areas. Both hardware and CAD algorithm issues will be addressed. The proposed project will contribute to identify the bottlenecks of current prototyping systems and discovering novel solutions. This research will contribute to faster mapping processes, low cost - high utilization systems, and real-time emulation.","title":"Research on Rapid Prototyping Systems Using Field Programmable Devices","awardID":"9529077","effectiveDate":"1996-09-15","expirationDate":"1999-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4710","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["451456"],"PO":["321058"]},"11938":{"abstract":"This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), jointly funded by the Theory of Computing (TOC) Program, CCR, by Computational Biology Activity, BIR and by the Systemic Biology Program, DEB, addresses problems in the construction of phylogenies or evolutionary trees. The formulation and effective solution of this problem requires a collaborative multidisciplinary effort from biologists, statisticians and computer scientists. The ideal methodology for solving this problem would include the following steps:(a) Observe data on the species that exist today; (b) Identify a biological model (such as the Jukes-Cantor model or Kimura two parameter model); (c) Based on the model from Step (b), design an objective function and efficient optimization methods for this function so that the tree that optimizes this objective function is the tree that best fits the model. Unfortunately, this ideal program is impossible to realize, because of roadblocks at every step: (i) Data is subject to experimental error and to errors due to its interpretation and use in phylogeny construction methods;(ii) It seems difficult to identify a precise biological model for evolution; (iii) Given the stochastic model of evolution, one candidate for the optimizing tree is the ``most likely tree''. Given the uncertainty of what is actually the ``best'' model, a most likely tree under one model should still be a very likely tree under a slightly different model. Demonstrating this has proven to be a very difficult problem. The goals of this SGER proposal include:(1) Modification of the ideal methodology so that Difficulties(i) -- (iii) are removed; (2) Testing of various models using r-RNA and tufA sequence data supplied by a molecular biologist; (3) Using the experimental results, design of general methods for inferring phylogeny;(4) Comparison of these new models with existing models for the data. In addition, one of the goals of this SGER award is to initiate a multidisciplinary effort between the biologists, statisticians, and computer scientists at the University of Pennsylvania.***","title":"Models, Methods, and Criteria for Phylogeny Construction","awardID":"9612829","effectiveDate":"1996-09-01","expirationDate":"1998-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0801","name":"Division of ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY","abbr":"DEB"},"pgm":{"id":"1127","name":"EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES CLUSTER"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0808","name":"Division of BIOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"DBI"},"pgm":{"id":"1107","name":"COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY ACTIVITI"}}],"PIcoPI":["382346"],"PO":["150516"]}}
