{"5995":{"abstract":"The goal of this project is to help scientists and engineers carry out computational tasks more effectively by doing research on: - The integration of symbolic and numeric computation to facilitate problem specification, exploration and result verification. - Hierarchies of reusable computational abstractions organized in libraries with well-defined navigational structures. - Exploiting commercial standards and tools for object-request brokers, compound documents, and collaboration infrastructure. The project takes a novel approach to problem-solving environments (PSEs). Its focus is on the entire process of problem-solving from initial conception, symbolic specification, solution, visualization, comparison with experimental data, and feed back. The project focuses on problem-solving environments, not merely programming environments. This focus leads to research on reusable abstractions at all levels of problem-solving. Important abstractions include the problem-solving method itself, method-specific abstractions for sequential and parallel program design, reasoning and debugging, performance analysis and tuning, and frameworks for class libraries. PSEs are more useful when they are more specific. However, rather than build one problem- solving environment for one class of user, application domain, programming language and machine, this project aims at the basic research that will enable us to develop tools for building specific PSEs. To use a metaphor, rather than doing research on workbenches we want to do research on machine tools that can be used to build workbenches. Traditional PSEs deal with extending a workstation environment whereas this project is concerned with developing structured environments for problem-solving. Scientists and engineers collaborate when they solve problems, and they share much more than code. PSEs based on collaboration also provide object-request brokering and compound multimedia document interfaces. Since this vision is both novel and ambitious, a critical aspect of the project is leveraging methods and tools developed for scientific, commercial and home-computing applications.","title":"MDC: Integration of Symbolic Computing with Framework of Classes and Problem-Solving Archetypes","awardID":"9527130","effectiveDate":"1995-10-01","expirationDate":"1999-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":["208799","470889","138667","499268","285304"],"PO":["187585"]},"4885":{"abstract":"9521756 Cobb The Southern College of Optometry requests support from NSF for a connection to the Internet through the SURAnet regional network.

Our architecture will integrate existing and future Internet technology to support collaborative, highly interactive educational settings.

The project represents a rational melding of existing technologies in new ways that we believe will do as much for active learning as the advent of World-Wide Web browsers such as Mosaic has done for passive browsing of information. Key elements of our proposal are: a participatory design approach involving teachers and students as design team members (in contrast to externally-imposed educational technology solutions). support for reuse of a wide variety of educational software available on the Internet (in contrast to requiring and assuming custom-designed educational applications). asynchronous extensions to interactive, collaborative environments (in contrast to the current dichotomy between non-interactive e-mail collaborations and strictly real-time interactions via MUDs and MOOs). multimedia extensions to interactive, collaborative environments (in contrast to teletype-style interactions currently supported by MUDs and MOOs). collaborative system support for heterogeneous platforms ranging from PCs to high-end workstations (in contrast to the assumption of homogenous computing environments). continuous on-site teacher support to help in selection and composition of project-oriented curriculum elements, community involvement in experimental projects, and evaluation of technology change, attitudes, and outcomes.

The goal is to develop high-performance, state-of -the-art software packages called particle movers, capable of simulating the motion of thousands of particles in 2-D and hundreds in 3-D domains, in both Newtonian fluids, governed by the Navier-Strokes equations, and in several popular models of viscoelastic fluids. Such simulations will be extremely computationally intensive. It is therefor imperative to develop the most efficient possible computational schemes, and to implement them on parallel machines, using state-of-the-art parallel algorithms. The project will develop two different computational schemes for simulating solid-liquid flows on parallel computers. The first is a generalization of the standard Galerkin finite element method in which both the fluid and particle equations of motion are incorporated into a single variational equation, containing both fluid and particle velocities as primitive unknowns. In the second approach, an embedding method, the fluid flow is computed as if the space occupied by the particles were filled with fluid. The no-slip boundary condition of the particle boundaries is enforced as a constraint using Lagrange multipliers. This allows a fixed grid to be used, eliminating the need for remeshing, a definite advantage in parallel implementations. The new schemes will be used to study the microstructural (pair interaction) effects which produce clusters and anisotropic structures in particulate flows, to produce statistical analyses of particulate flows (mean values, fluctuation levels and spectral properties), to derive engineering correlations of the kind usually obtained from expe riments, and to provide clues and closure data for the development of two-phase flow models and a standard against which to judge the performance of such models.

The architecture, called Cube-4, exploits parallelism and pipelining to achieve real-time rendering of high-resolution images from volume data. The architecture is based on an algorithm for ray casting of a volume buffer of voxels which is stored as a skewed distributed memory to support conflict-free access to voxel structures. It performs interpolation of sampled points, shading, and compositing to generate the pixel values. Computations are done using limited communication between processors, so that the architecture is scalable over a wide range of performances and image resolutions. This project encompasses algorithm development, architecture research, and construction of a reduced-resolution prototype.","title":"Scalable Architecture for Real Time Volume Rendering","awardID":"9527694","effectiveDate":"1995-10-01","expirationDate":"1999-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"4725","name":"EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS\/CADRE"}}],"PIcoPI":["541908"],"PO":["549626"]},"5994":{"abstract":"; R o o t E n t r y F Tz C| C o m p O b j b W o r d D o c u m e n t ^ O b j e c t P o o l Tz C| Tz C| 4 @ = > ? @ A B C D E F G F Microsoft Word 6.0 Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.6 ; DMS-9527124 Trotter Advanced Scientific Computing Centers This award covers a broad research program in the area of computational optimization. The central thrust of the research addresses real-life, large-scale mixed-inter programming problems arising from important industrial application areas, such as manufacturing, telecommunications, and distribution. These problems are of vast importance towards the nation s present and future economic and technological development. The problems are also extremely intractable, both from the viewpoint of practical computation, as well as in terms of theoretical understanding, and they will only become larger and more difficult in future applications. The computational and methodological technology for solving integer programming models has made steady advances over the last thirty years, often following improvements in computing machinery as much as new theoretical insights. We are now at the starting point of a major quantum improvement in the technology. Not only are there several new and promising methodological venues available, but we are witnessin g a revolution in the computing world, in particular involving parallel computing and operating systems, with profound implications for science and engineering. It is almost certain that within a few years all computers will have multiple CPUs, and that all major scientific and engineering computing will be done on clusters of multiple-CPU machines. As supercomputing becomes redefined, a push to parallelize algorithms is starting now, and the end result will be software of extraordinary complexity by today s standards. However, it is fair to say that the field of parallel integer programming is, at best, in its infancy. The research seeks to propel computational integer programming into the realm of parallel computing, with the objective of effectively handling difficult real-world problems. The objective will require a multidisciplinary approach. Our work will seek to extend and develop solution methodologies for integer programming, in particular involving cutting planes, column generation, and branch-and-cut techniques. This will be integrated with computational theory techniques, especially the design of efficient data structures for parallel integer programming. Finally, there will be a large component of software engineering, necessary for the implementation of efficient parallel programs. This work combines the scientific and computational resources of three participating organizations, Columbia University, Cornell University, and the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, to create a collaborative research environment to attain the goals outlined above. Among the many important advantages of such a close relationship between university computing research groups and that of a major hardware producer is the focus on practical ends provided by the industrial component.

The personnel participating in the Center, who will be involved in this project, represent an interdisciplinary team with expertise in many areas of imaging, high-speed data-acquisition and storage, and imaging-processing. The development and acquisition of advanced imaging instrumentation falls in two broad categories: (1) high-speed image acquisition systems, and (2) advances in image-processing, storage, and graphics systems. It is intended to extend the presently-available, state- of-the-art in this field, resulting in new, nationally and internationally unique capabilities. An attempt is made to balance the greater risks of development versus acquisition by the much more capable technology that would result. This endeavor is shared by industrial and governmental partners, such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, EPIX, Inc., General Pixels, Inc., Boeing Co. and Baxter Healthcare, Inc. The activities of the CQV and the proposed infrastructure project form an integral part of the educational and research environment at Caltech, with broad and intense participation by students, faculty, visitors, and staff. Furthermore, this center will serve equally as a bridge between university and industry by providing the means for transfer of technology and science, between academia and industry, and by preparing students for the industrial work environment. ***","title":"Development and Acquisition of High Speed\/Resolution Imaging Systems","awardID":"9512517","effectiveDate":"1995-10-01","expirationDate":"1998-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2890","name":"CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0702","name":"Division of CHEM, BIOENG, ENV, &  TRANSP S","abbr":"CBET"},"pgm":{"id":"1415","name":"PARTICULATE &MULTIPHASE PROCES"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0702","name":"Division of CHEM, BIOENG, ENV, &  TRANSP S","abbr":"CBET"},"pgm":{"id":"9155","name":"ACADEMIC RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTU"}}],"PIcoPI":["266906","544292","508959"],"PO":["433053"]}}
