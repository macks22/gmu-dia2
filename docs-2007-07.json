{"129547":{"abstract":"LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) is an active sensor now approved by FEMA for construction of digital terrain models (DTMs) and digital elevation models (DEMs). DTMs and DEMs, together with appropriate GIS layers, are key sources for the construction of digital flood insurance rate maps. LiDAR use has not yet supplanted the DEMs and DTMs that have been generated using other methods that have been available for decades. However, the momentum is in that direction; the goal of this research is to show that LiDAR - combined with multispectral data - can (1) detect watersheds in urban areas that are at the scale of a neighborhood and thus can be used for storm drainage management, and (2) collect sufficient detail of the urban structural landscape to be of real use in predicting property damage for given catastropic events such as floods or earthquakes. Both LiDAR and IKONUS multispectral imagery for New Orleans, Louisiana will be used. By a combination of new analytical techniques, field observation, and comparison to standard datasets, the value of LiDAR data now owned by many state and local jurisdictions will be increased. A key element of the research is the development of a set of information fusion algorithms-that answer each of the questions: (1) Can present USGS DEMs and DTMs be improved by automatic detection of break lines and neighborhood-scale watersheds gleaned from LiDAR elevation data fused with multi-spectral imagery? (2) Can the heights, geometries, and footprints of buildings be determined with an accuracy sufficient for disaster assessment? (3) Can the fusion product provide a modeling tool to predict, given factors such as water rising level, the potential damage and provide valuable information for pre- and post-disaster planning? To address these issues will require an interdisciplinary research team consisting of an environmental engineer and two computer scientists.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: Fusing sensory data from such very different modalities using signal-level methods would be a significant achievement. LiDAR data itself will become a much more valuable commodity in the communities that possess it.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The research contributes to scholarship and public policy in two ways. First, the results will demonstrate to State and Federal agencies responsible for environmental assessment and remediation new methods for quantifying the present and past states with data already collected for floodplain analysis. Second, it will provide urban planners an inexpensive way to acquire data for economic analysis, project evaluation, and disaster damage assessment. A specific, tangible outcome (when taken in conjuction with relevant commercial work) will be lower flood insurance rates for residential and business land owners as well as more accurate assessment of tax liabilities by all jurisdictions. Data and algorithmic products produced will be disseminated through the Army Corps of Engineers at no cost to FEMA or others.","title":"SGER: A New Tool for Economic and Environmental Planning - Expanding the Boundaries of LiDAR","awardID":"0722106","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2008-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["352939","461421","385819"],"PO":["371077"]},"129558":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>CNS 0721927 PI Christopher Hundhausen, Washington State University<br\/>CNS 0722139 PI N.

Conventional offline bug-finding techniques help, but scale poorly, have extremely high cost, and can be ineffective due to imprecise environment models. Online verification has the potential to mitigate these problems, but it adds a performance overhead and no techniques are known to recover systems from a general class of errors.

The proposed work can improve industrial productivity by enhancing system availability, reducing system administration overheads, and handling unsupervised settings and unpredictable environments.

The work develops both new, low-cost hardware designs characterized by simplicity and predictability and stable and robust planning and control algorithms that will use sensing and learning to adapt to the different (non-ideal) capabilities of manipulators. The equipment will foster tight integration between different research programs such that algorithmic advances can be rapidly deployed on new hardware, and new hardware capabilities can drive new algorithmic development. Addressing both the algorithmic and device-level challenges that enable robots to interact adaptively with the physical world and with humans in unstructured dynamic environments, the project responds to the current lack of rigorous and practical scientific foundation for manipulation. The combination of algorithmic solutions to modeling, control, planning, and adaptation, and a robotic manipulation platform is expected to lead to new low-cost manipulation platforms within a few years. The designs include compliant and capable robot manipulators, as well as modular cooperative, neuromimetic, and underwater manipulators.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Affordable, teachable, mobile manipulators should enable in-home assistants for the elderly and\/or incapacitated. The next-generation of robot manipulators is likely to support new levels of factory automation, in which robots will work synergistically with humans to reduce manufacturing cost.

It can trace the wavefront for simulating optical effects currently unavailable in graphics, such as continuous refraction in inhomogeneous media, diffraction in complex objects, interference of light waves, and Doppler effects.

Enhance JML's infrastructure including its type checker, runtime assertion checking compiler, and IDE support;<br\/>. Make JML's software infrastructure more extensible; <br\/>. Substantially improve the documentation of the language and its supporting tools; <br\/>. Develop course materials and tutorials to facilitate classroom use of JML; and<br\/>. Disseminate a well-documented, extensible, open source suite of enhanced JML tools.<br\/>JML (Java Modeling Language), a formal specification language that can document detailed designs of Java and interfaces, has been used in different projects with great benefit. Feedback is obtained from users who are attracted by the ability to check Java code against JML specifications using a variety of tools. New research problems, however, are forcing re-inventing the infrastructure that JML provides, slowing the innovation, since JML does not support many of the new features of Java version 5, most notably generics. The Verified Software grand challenge has identified lack of extensible tools for formal methods research as a major impediment to experimentation. This project responds to the challenge by enhancing, extending, and well-documenting the infrastructure to advance and accelerate Java formal methods research.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The infrastructure is expected to open barriers to formal methods adoption among software engineering professionals by endowing a large collection of tools that share a common, mature specification language. These advantages should attract more educators and improve reliability in safety- and mission-critical systems. Moreover, strengthening the formal methods component in software engineering curriculum, courses will be developed and targeted to undergraduate research,. The collaborative involves two minority-serving institutions and an institution in an EPSCoR state.","title":"Collaborative Research: CRI: CRD: A JML Community Infrastructure -- Revitalizing Tools and Documentation to Aid Formal Methods Research","awardID":"0709169","effectiveDate":"2007-07-15","expirationDate":"2010-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7359","name":"COMPUTING RES INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":[336030],"PO":["557609"]},"129603":{"abstract":"Undergraduate computer education will benefit from this project''s focus on the preparation of students for a computing and technology workplace that is increasingly diverse and trans-disciplinary.

A realistic depiction of human motion drastically enhances the perceptual immersion for task training, social communication, or tele-learning. In a believable virtual environment, a human character must be able to plan its locomotion, react to the environment, and engage other virtual characters or real humans with realistic display of emotion and personality. This daunting task requires simulation from the musculoskeletal system to the nervous system, as these intricate components must coordinate in synchrony when a functional activity is undertaken. Physics-based character animation today can simulate complex locomotion sequences with stunning visual realism, albeit under the careful guidance of the animator. What is missing from most character animation techniques is autonomous control, both conscious and unconscious. In this project, the investigator expands computer-generated character animation from a visualization tool to an interdisciplinary research area focused on autonomous control and realistic locomotion.<br\/><br\/>This project focuses on two inter-related research thrusts fundamentally aligned with the interdisciplinary nature of the investigator's research theme: (1) synthesis of non-ballistic, low-energy human locomotion, and (2) synthesis of interaction among multiple characters. Unlike ballistic and highly dynamic motion, non-ballistic motion is not stringently determined by physics, thus requiring more sophisticated models to address the complex interplay of unconscious autonomous control, such as physiology and emotion, and conscious autonomous control, such as the intents of the character. The autonomous control becomes even more crucial when multiple character interaction comes into play. Synthesis of interaction is challenging because the high-level artificial intelligence algorithms and low-level locomotion intertwine in an unpredictable manner when the interaction takes place. Beyond the scope of computer animation, this computational model can provide a device for recognizing emotion, diagnosing musculoskeletal anomalies, or validating biomechanical hypotheses.","title":"CAREER: Synthesis of Autonomous, Realistic Human Motion","awardID":"0742302","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2013-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["496078"],"PO":["532791"]},"132233":{"abstract":"This is funding to support a doctoral consortium (workshop) for about 12 promising graduate students, along with distinguished research faculty, which will take place in conjunction with the 2007 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL\/HCC07), to be held September 22-26 in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society. Interactive computer software now permeates many individuals' working lives, and people are increasingly relying on computing and information systems for leisure and home activities as well. As a result, end users now expect considerable flexibility and control in their interactions with computer software. For many, it is no longer sufficient to consume the packaged software and scripted tasks developed by the professional software industry; they now must produce their own computational solutions to a wide variety of problems, including spreadsheet models, web sites, educational media and simulations, automated business procedures, and scientific visualizations. But in order to produce such software, even for domain-specific problems, end users must acquire the conceptual models and skills of computational thinking. Thus, the focus of this year's VL\/HCC doctoral consortium, the fifth to be funded by NSF in this series, is to look beyond surface-level interactions with computers to consider an area of fundamental information power: computational problem solving. Participants will explore how varying communication media, representations, and problem-solving support affect end users' willingness and ability to access, manipulate, and program solutions to their work or everyday problems. What are the special needs of disadvantaged populations? How can computational problem-solving tools and devices be designed to meet these needs? The workshop will bring together and build community among young researchers working on different aspects of these problems from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education. It will guide the work of these new researchers by providing an opportunity for experts in the research field (as well as their peers) to give them advice, in that student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive feedback from the faculty panel. The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. A 2-page extended abstract of each participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings.

This event will promote discovery and learning, by encouraging the student researchers to explore a difficult and challenging open problem, through involvement of a panel of well-known researchers whose task is to provide constructive feedback, and through inclusion of other conference participants who will also learn from and provide additional feedback to the students and to each other.

The ISMB conference has provided an annual forum for disseminating the latest developments in bioinformatics since 1993, thus serving as a key vehicle for achievement of the Society''''s mission. Past ISMB conferences have drawn as many as 2136 attendees from 35+ countries. Since 2000 the conference location has been moved between North America, Europe, and non- North American\/non-European sites to foster international exchange and collaboration. As a multidisciplinary conference rich in diversity, ISMB brings together students, researchers, faculty, and staff, all of whom share a focus on computer science, molecular biology, biology, mathematics and\/or statistics. ISMB focuses on research centered on actual biological problems rather than simply theoretical calculations, and attendees effectively discuss and distribute the latest developments in intelligent systems for molecular biology. Intelligent systems include any software which goes beyond straightforward, closed-form algorithms or standard database technologies, and encompasses those that view data in a symbolic fashion, learn from examples, consolidate multiple levels of abstraction, or synthesize results to be cognitively tractable to a human, including the development and application of advanced computational methods for biological problems. Relevant computational techniques presented at the conference include machine learning, pattern recognition, knowledge representation, databases, combinatorics, stochastic modeling, string and graph algorithms, linguistic methods, robotics, constraint satisfaction, and parallel computation. Biological areas presented at the conference include molecular structure, genomics, molecular sequence analysis, evolution and phylogenetics, molecular interactions, metabolic pathways, regulatory networks, developmental control, molecular biology generally and human health. The scientific program for ISMB\/ECCB 2007 comprises research papers reviewed by at least two members of the program committee, and approved by a topic Area Chair, insuring the highest quality of work is presented and subsequently published as an issue of the journal Bioinformatics. New for 2007 is the addition of tracks dedicated to recently published work, special sessions on focused research areas, and an industry track to showcase achievements and future directions within the commercial community. Additionally, late breaking research is supported through posters and peer reviewed abstracts are selected for oral presentation. Meetings of special interest groups, a student organized symposium, tutorials, software demos and a vendor exhibition fill out the schedule.","title":"ISMB 2007 Conference - Annual Meeting for ISCB held jointly in 2007 with the Annual ECCB in Vienna, Austria, 21-25 July, 2007.","awardID":"0733738","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2008-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0808","name":"Division of BIOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"DBI"},"pgm":{"id":"1165","name":"ADVANCES IN BIO INFORMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["375319"],"PO":["561879"]},"126403":{"abstract":"Proposal #: CNS 07-07939 07-08344<br\/>PI(s): Isler, Ibrahim V.

The work involves investigating the relationship between the capabilities of individual units and the collective capabilities of the entire robotic team. The major innovation lies in the creation of a flexible design spectrum for both research and education based on the capabilities of the individual units. On the lower end of the spectrum, the basic design \"Explorer,\" a robot based on a Gumstix unit and earlier robot designs from one of the institutions, provides an inexpensive and yet significantly powerful solution. On the higher end, the platform \"MicroVision,\" a robot based on the Intel Pentium M processor and RoboAudioStix board, provides real-time video streaming and processing using standard off-the-shelf hardware and open-source video algorithms. The modularity of both designs allows the addition of special hardware capabilities. The infrastructure aims at low-cost, easy-to-use platforms that support research and can be adopted into courses.

This is particularly unfortunate for children with severe motor impairments who retain control of their eye movements and have the potential to use an eye tracker, but who miss out on important childhood developmental activities because of a lack of suitable interactive software to support these activities. In a previous research project in which he developed EyeDraw, software that enables children with severe motor impairments to draw pictures with their eye movements, the PI showed that for this community eye tracking can provide a powerful and noninvasive means of creative expression. Though EyeDraw was in many ways a success, during its development the PI identified three major problems that hinder efforts by researchers and practitioners to create eye-controlled software for these children. Firstly, no rapid prototyping tools or software application frameworks are available specifically for developing eye-controlled applications. Furthermore, eye-controlled software is typically intended for expert use and does not provide enjoyable experiences at first glance. Last but not least, there is no established practice for working with children with severe disabilities as partners in software design. This project responds to these problems by pursuing a number of related activities, within the concrete context of computer applications that support playing music. The PI will determine which participatory design techniques can work with children with severe motor impairments, and will establish a design practice that allows him to collaborate directly with them and their caregivers, to develop software that enables the children to make music with eye movements. He will create a framework that supports rapid prototyping of eye-controlled applications for this user community by giving caregivers, practitioners, and researchers a means to quickly generate eye-interactive sketches so that the children can communicate, explore alternatives, provide feedback, and express themselves creatively. And he will design intervention techniques that address the difficulties associated with the initial use of eye-controlled software, to ensure an immediate sense of accomplishment, satisfaction, interaction, control, encouragement, and expression. This last goal will be accomplished through interfaces that support musical expression even with a low-fidelity zero-point calibration, and which incrementally improve the calibration during expressive musical activities while also gradually introducing advanced functionality and opportunities for creative musical expression. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This project will advance an understanding of how to build eye-controlled software for children with severe disabilities, a challenge that is not addressed by the current scientific or design literature. Project outcomes will provide young people with severe motor impairments with a means of engaging in artistic pursuits that are currently out of reach. The rapid prototyping framework for eye-controlled applications will provide an infrastructure for university classroom instruction and future researchers.","title":"HCC: Easy-to-Learn and Easy-to-Use Eye-Controlled Musical Expression For Children with Severe Disabilities","awardID":"0713688","effectiveDate":"2007-07-15","expirationDate":"2013-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["451330","565362"],"PO":["565227"]},"126678":{"abstract":"Proposal #: CNS 07-09437<br\/>PI(s): Soliman, Handy S.<br\/> Liebrock, Lorie M.; Mazumdar, Subhasish; Mukkamala, Srinivas; Shin, Dongwan<br\/>Institution: New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology <br\/> Socorro, NM 87801-4796<br\/>Title: ENSL: Experimental Network of Sensors Lab for Advancing Research in Sensed-Data Collection, Integration, Management, and Analysis<br\/><br\/>This project, building a multi-tier network in 4 layers, aims to tackle problems related to the acquisition and analysis of data from a network of sensors with the premise that the network topology and the data processing hierarchy should be matched. Thus, as data from sensor nodes moves to leader nodes in the field and thence to more powerful data collection nodes, it gets transformed in phases: from data to information (e.g., data aggregation), then from information to knowledge (e.g., spatial and temporal trends), and finally from knowledge to intelligence, i.e., decisions (based on soft computing and other models plus analysis of past decisions). Tiers 1 through 4 describe the hierarchy and associate them with different computing power, connectivity, and research problems. Tiers 1 and 2 will focus on energy-aware transmission between nodes, develop a security framework for sensors, study and apply fusion techniques, and experiment with network protocols. Nodes at Tiers 3 and 4 will be used to dynamically control the operations of Tiers 1 and 2 sensors, e.g., by altering cryptographic parameters based on risk analysis, and by changing transmission requirements to promote energy preservation while trading off data quality. The powerful multi-processor Tier 4 nodes will be used to experiment with simulations and data mining algorithms that result in the decisions about the sensed data, and about the environment of the network itself (e.g., intrusion detection). This Tier will also provide visualization, a critical resource for comprehension and abstraction of the full sensor network.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Enabling cross-fertilization of ideas from networking, data management, visualization, parallel computing, security, and data mining, the project creates new tools and software components for researchers. ENSL will also introduce new courses and enrich those existing.

Neutral etching avoids the problem of substrate charging that occurs when energetic ions are used to etch wafers in the microelectronics industry. The acceleration of ions through sheaths in multi-ion plasmas is a fundamental plasma physics question with important ramifications for systems ranging from space plasmas to fusion plasmas. There are two primary objectives of this proposal. First is the determination of the effect of additional ion species on double layer formation in expanding helicon plasmas, and second, the measurement of the momentum coupling between ions and neutral atoms in the layer due to charge exchange processes. The essential intellectual merit of the proposed activity will be the first detailed measurement of the flow velocities of two different ion species and a single neutral species in a plasma sheath. Ion acceleration through pre-sheaths and sheaths in multi-ion plasmas is not fully understood and this project will make a significant contribution to this active area of fundamental plasma science research. <br\/><br\/>The broader impact of the work involves the training of graduate students in a research environment that emphasizes the synergy between basic and applied plasma physics; improvement of the percentage of women obtaining advanced degrees in physics; and attracting high quality undergraduates into physics through involvement in cutting-edge research activities. Impact on the field of plasma etching of semiconductors is also likely since production of significant fluxes of energetic neutral atoms through charge exchange neutralization of the double layer accelerated ions would provide a new means of etching features in silicon at scales of less than ten nanometers. Impact on the field of plasma propulsion is also likely given that plasma detachment from plasma-based thrusters is an important and unresolved question.","title":"Ion And Neutral Velocity Distributions In Multi-ion Plasma Sheaths","awardID":"0713784","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2010-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0301","name":"Division of PHYSICS","abbr":"PHY"},"pgm":{"id":"1242","name":"PLASMA PHYSICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"T885","name":"DIA-MASINT"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0702","name":"Division of CHEM, BIOENG, ENV, &  TRANSP S","abbr":"CBET"},"pgm":{"id":"1407","name":"COMBUSTION, FIRE, & PLASMA SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["484316"],"PO":["564756"]},"125237":{"abstract":"High-performance processors provide the horsepower beneath the computing infrastructure that supports society's institutions.

Much software is non-parallel, complex, and irregular, and cannot take advantage of multiple processors in traditional ways. Thus, the multicore theme must be combined with a new sequential-program-centric thrust.<br\/><br\/>This project puts forward a new microarchitecture theme, in which the processor has a global perspective of a running program's data objects and their current influence on the program as a whole. In the chief proposed design, changes to objects are met in real-time by specializing the few candidate fragments of code that could operate next on the objects, simplifying and resolving the code based on the new data stored within the objects. This significantly reduces the length of the running program. <br\/>This new execution model presents a unique form of parallelization: <br\/>although the program itself is not parallelized (it is reduced), specialization tasks are highly parallel by virtue of assigning responsibility for different objects to different processors in a multicore or many-core platform. An alternative interpretation may be that the specialization tasks among many cores constitute a meta dataflow execution of the whole program. Another powerful aspect is maintaining persistent meta-data about the program among specialization cores -- information a compiler has (and more) but which is now embedded in the execution fabric, enabled by the computation and memory capacity of future multicore substrates.","title":"The Phase Based Behavior of Objects","awardID":"0702632","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2011-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4715","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["518384"],"PO":["559883"]},"125248":{"abstract":"Symmetry Analysis of 3D Shapes and its Applications in Computer Graphics<br\/>Thomas Funkhouser<br\/><br\/>Symmetry is a fundamental property of 3D shape. Understanding an object's symmetries provides insight into its overall shape, its decomposition into parts, its balance of mass, and its possibilities for motion. Meanwhile, symmetry is ubiquitous in our world. Almost all man-made objects exhibit some perfect symmetry, and many organic structures are nearly symmetric and\/or composed of nearly symmetric parts (e.g., the bodies of animals). For decades, however, computer graphics researchers have ignored symmetries when designing geometric processing algorithms, instead focusing upon local shape features and\/or differential surface properties when manipulating surfaces. As a result, for example, surface reconstruction algorithms produce asymetric meshes for symmetric objects, mesh compression techniques fail to take advantage of approximate symmetries, and mesh completion algorithms fill holes by extrapolating surface properties near their boundaries rather than by copying shape features from symmetric parts. Clearly, methods for analyzing and exploiting the symmetries of an object could greatly improve these and other surface processing applications.<br\/><br\/>The research is accomplishing the following: (1) investigating the theory of symmetry for 3D shapes, (2) developing analysis algorithms for characterizing symmetries of 3D shapes, and (3) demonstrating the utility of symmetry analysis in several computer graphics applications. Expected research results include new multiresolution descriptions of the approximate symmetries of an object and new algorithms that use these descriptions for remeshing, compression, completion, reverse engineering, and editing of 3D meshes. The immediate impact on computer graphics is not only new algorithms for shape analysis, but perhaps also a new way of thinking - understanding and preserving global properties of shape (e.g., symmetry) when editing and processing surfaces, rather than focusing only on local geometric properties. The broader impacts will be felt in other fields that benefit from improved symmetry analysis and in integrated educational activities.","title":"Symmetry Analysis of 3D Shapes and its Applications in Computer Graphics","awardID":"0702672","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2010-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7453","name":"GRAPHICS & VISUALIZATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["533355"],"PO":["532791"]},"129736":{"abstract":"Proposal #: CNS 07-22782<br\/>PI(s): Erlebacher, Gordon; Chassignet, Erik P.; Ellington, Robert G.; Shih, Chiang; Wilgenbusch, James C.<br\/>Institution: Florida State University <br\/> Tallahassee, FL 32306-4166<br\/>Title: MRI\/Acq.: Stereographic Projection System to Support Multiidisciplinary Scientific Visualization<br\/><br\/>Project Proposed:<br\/>This project, acquiring and managing a high-resolution stereographic projection system to support multidisciplinary research, enables sophisticated and realistic simulations of physical phenomena ranging from hurricane formation and prediction, lightning strikes, convective phenomena, fires, ocean dynamics, and protein folding.

Improving the energy efficiency of parallel disks is an intrinsic requirement of next generation high-performance computing systems, because a storage subsystem can represent 27% of the energy consumed in a data center. However, it is a major challenge to conserve energy for parallel disks and energy efficiently coordinate I\/Os of hundreds or thousands of concurrent disk devices to meet high-performance and energy-saving requirements. This research investigates novel energy conservation techniques to provide significant energy savings while achieving low-cost and high-performance for parallel disks. In this research project, the investigators take an organized approach to implementing energy-saving techniques for parallel disks, simulating energy-efficient parallel disk systems, and conducting a physical demonstration. This research involves four tasks: (1) design and develop a buffer-disk (BUD) architecture to reduce energy dissipation in parallel disk systems; (2) develop innovative energy-saving techniques, including an energy-related reliability model, energy-aware data partitioning, disk request processing, data movement, data placement, prefetching strategies, and power management for buffer disks; (3) implement a simulation toolkit (BUDSIM) used to develop a variety of energy-saving techniques and their integration in the BUD architecture; and (4) validate the BUD architecture along with our innovative energy-conservation techniques using real data-intensive applications running on high-performance clusters. This research can benefit society by developing economically attractive and environmentally friendly parallel disk systems, which are able to lower electricity bills and reduce emissions of air pollutants.

In applications where appearance matters, from designing textiles and apparel to rendering virtual actors to formulating hair cosmetics, understanding how these materials' physical properties affect their motion and appearance is crucial. Fiber-based structures behave differently from other materials. A knit fabric is much more extensible than its component yarns because the yarns can bend and slide into different macroscopic shapes. A head of long hair moves freely but smoothly, making and breaking millions of hair-hair contacts to produce a partly smooth, partly discontinuous overall motion. This research aims to improve the accuracy of cloth and hair simulation by fundamentally changing the underlying physical and computational models.<br\/><br\/>The project follows an approach of measurement, modeling, simulation, and validation. Image-based measurement is used to capture complete fabric deformations. This data, together with the literature on yarn-level textile mechanics, is used to develop constitutive models based on the actual physics of fabric, which are simulated using advanced numerical methods not normally employed in textile simulation. The results are being evaluated both against the laboratory data and in the context of real problems in apparel design. By bringing together the tools of modern graphics and simulation with the detailed models of textile mechanics in a rigorous process of validation, this project is placing computer graphics cloth simulation on a firm scientific foundation for the future. Computational methods devised for fiber-fiber interactions are also being extended for efficient strand-level simulation of hair. After the simulations are validated, the project will examine approximations and algorithms to allow efficient simulation. The end result will be new, physics-based models for the mechanics of cloth and hair that are appropriate for visual applications.","title":"Accurate and Efficient Visual Simulation of Fiber-based Mechanical Structures","awardID":"0702490","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2011-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7453","name":"GRAPHICS & VISUALIZATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["497275","448639","402591"],"PO":["532791"]},"125216":{"abstract":"Excessive power consumption is becoming an increasingly important issue for our nation.

This project establishes a Pacific Rim Community of computer science departments, high tech industry and international programs to explore a new model of computer science education that focuses on the knowledge, skills and competencies necessary for professional success and leadership in a flat world. This project, involving collaboration between the University of Oregon and Portland State University, will help to revitalize computer science education by infusing it with international perspectives and provide a model for growing similar communities nationwide. The Pacific Rim was chosen because of the growing importance of this region in the high technology industry and because the PIs are situated in universities with exceptionally strong Pacific Rim ties and expertise. <br\/><br\/>The core of this project is a series of community building workshops involving a diverse group of academic and industrial partners across the Pacific Rim. The workshops will address four key topics: assessing the needs, benefits and barriers to internationalization; cultural impacts on computer science courses and pedagogy; cultural awareness through international experiences; and community sustainability.<br\/>In addition to the workshops, the project team will develop a globally available on-line resource repository for internationalization of computer science education. This repository will collect the results from the workshop series: seed ideas and recommendations for programmatic change, proposals for curricular innovation, new technologies for international pedagogy and collaboration, a database of international programs, key contacts, and bibliographic references. The repository will also include a video archive of the workshops.<br\/><br\/>The primary intellectual merit of this project is the enrichment and refinement of the concept of internationalization for computer science education using the Pacific Rim as a model community.

Both security problems are addressed with sound security models and mechanisms. The security mechanisms include the following: (1) designing a variety of schemes, including cryptographic and non-cryptographic, to facilitate secure and practical knowledge-extraction; (2) developing methods for mitigation of the damage due to knowledge-breaching that is inevitable in the course of knowledge-dissemination; and (3) full exploration of the notion of (dynamic) policy-directed knowledge-dissemination and its cryptographic-based implementation. <br\/><br\/>This inter-institutional collaborative project will provide a team-oriented learning and research environment for graduate students, and research results will also be integrated into educational courses.

CBD addresses the lack of an organized design theory for the class of software identified as packaged software. CBD reuses existing design knowledge to create new design knowledge, thus relying on a continuous cycle of knowledge creation. CBD profits from this project through the creation of a theoretical framework of case-based design as an organizational knowledge creation process as well as from an innovative tool to support CBD in packaged software implementations. The tool allows users to collaboratively create, edit and classify design cases. Users are able to explore complex design spaces along multiple user-evolved facets. The tool systematically recommends existing designs for reuse in new situations by utilizing user classifications and recommendation efforts. The fundamental belief is that by utilizing the collective power of a large group of people, better designs can be achieved at lower costs with lower risks. <br\/><br\/>The motivations for this project are the problems imposed by the increasing trend in information systems to use large software packages such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software. Particularly problematical are large system implementation complexities and on-going maintenance. These software systems are rarely used as packaged. Rather, they are customized, redesigned, enhanced, expanded, and integrated into other existing and evolving systems. Design in packaged software implementation (PSI) is the process of solving business problems by customizing and integrating the off-the-shelf software package. Design in PSI focuses on the add-on software components or modifications to the out-of-box software package. Effective and efficient designs can bring substantial returns and lower implementation costs and may eventually lead to wider adoption of packaged software. This benefits not only the software vendors but also society by lowering custom software development efforts of reinventing the wheel. However, there has been a lack of common design methodologies and CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools for PSI. Designs in PSI rely heavily on previous design experience. In fact, PSI experts frequently practice case-based design (CBD) when facing a new problem situation. They explore the past design cases, find a similar case, and reuse the design for that case in the new problem situation. As the same software package is being deployed in many implementations, CBD can significantly improve the quality, reduce the cost and lower the risks of designs. However, CBD can only be as good as the knowledge base of design cases. One of the challenges to utilizing CBD is the lack of CASE tools that support growing the design knowledge base. Consequently, this project develops and evaluates an open-source tool to support case-based design (CBD) in packaged software implementations (PSI). If used effectively with a large design knowledge base, case-based design can significantly reduce the cost, lower the risks and improve the quality of designs.","title":"SoD: Supporting Cased-Based Design for Packaged Software Implementations","awardID":"0725277","effectiveDate":"2007-07-15","expirationDate":"2011-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7652","name":"SCIENCE OF DESIGN"}}],"PIcoPI":[345726],"PO":["551712"]},"127506":{"abstract":"This one-year pilot proof-of-concenpt project generates paraphrases of semantically labeled input sentences using the semantics and syntax encoded in the publicly available FrameNet corpus and the lexical semantic information from the publicly available WordNet corpus.<br\/>Arbitrary text is first processed using an existing frame-semantic parser (such as Shalmaneser), and then passed to the paraphrasing algorithm.

As such, mixed-signal integrated circuits are now part of a broad spectrum of systems, many of which are deployed in mission-critical applications (e.g. avionics, medical equipment) or operate in hazardous environments (e.g. space, industrial operations). Consequently, the reliability of such systems becomes paramount, calling for advanced solutions to monitor their functional health during their operation in the field and to report potential malfunctions. While reliability has been extensively studied and a plethora of Concurrent Error Detection (CED) methods have been developed for digital circuits in the past, there is an alarming lack of pertinent solutions for their analog and RF counterparts. The objective of this project is to fill this void. To this end, its key novelty and uniqueness lies in the amalgamation of state-of-the-art practices in VLSI design and test, with concepts from control theory and pattern recognition, in order to develop CED solutions for analog and RF circuits. In short, this project will facilitate the realization of reliable electronic circuits and systems, thus extending their deployment in a broad range of applications, enabling reliable computing, and fostering technology trustworthiness.

Such attacks are \"generative\" in nature: the attacker works from a model for mimicking an aspect of human behavior and, through direct or indirect knowledge of the targeted user's biometrics, adapts the model to generate attempted reproductions of the user's input. In this context, two types of security mechanisms are studied: biometric authentication, where the user's biometric features are measured by a nonbypassable reference monitor and compared to a stored template; and password hardening, where the user's password and biometric features measured during the entry of the password are combined into a secret key (the \"hardened\" password) that should be irreproducible even to an attacker with full access to the device and software which create the key. Generative models for handwriting serve as an enabling input to evaluate schemes for performing handwritten password verification and for creating hardened passwords from handwriting. The size of the attacker's search space is quantified assuming that various categories of information have been gleaned (or captured) from the targeted user, as well as employing demographic statistics. Speech synthesis for targeting a specific user's voice is also studied in these same contexts. To the extent possible, techniques are identified for improving password hardening to withstand such attacks.","title":"Collaborative Research: Using Generative Models to Evaluate and Strengthen Biometrically Enhanced Systems","awardID":"0820903","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2008-11-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7371","name":"CYBER TRUST"}}],"PIcoPI":["553884"],"PO":["521752"]},"131599":{"abstract":"Routing and Topology for a New Internet<br\/><br\/>Abstract<br\/><br\/>Routing is the basic function of the internet.

Routers are currently constrained to use deterministic rules that only depend on the final destination (e.g., OSPF). Much of the current research on network topologies and routing algorithms assumes that any path is possible and must be reconsidered in this light, i.e., replacing all paths with only a subset such as shortest paths. The project addresses the specific questions of how to route so as to improve reliability and achieve the capacity of the underlying graph while being so constrained. Finally, tools for analyzing the capacity\/congestion of a network using shortest paths can guide the design of a new topology for the internet also: how to design a network where the shortest path congestion\/capacity is comparable to that achieved by arbitrary paths?","title":"SGER: Routing and Topology for a New Internet","awardID":"0731704","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2008-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["400310","565103"],"PO":["499399"]},"120357":{"abstract":"On-line role-playing environments provide exciting avenues for teaching science and are particularly effective with students who might otherwise be excluded from science study.

The main idea of error control codes is to append some appropriate redundant check bits to the information bits at the transmitter so that at the receiver, the errors in the information and check bits can be detected\/corrected using these extra redundant bits.<br\/><br\/>The data errors can be broadly classified as symmetric, asymmetric and unidirectional. In symmetric errors both 1 to 0 and 0 to 1 errors can occur in a received word. In asymmetric error case only one type, say 1 to 0 errors can occur. Finally, in the case of unidirectional case, the errors within a data word are of same type, either all 1 to 0 or all 0 to 1, but the error type is not known a priori.<br\/><br\/>In this proposal, some efficient design of error control codes for asymmetric and unidirectional errors are investigated. Furthermore, some novel error control techniques using automatic repeat request (ARQ) method are also studied. In ARQ protocol, error detecting codes are used in the system. Whenever a receiver receives a word, it checks whether there are some errors in the word. If none, it accepts the word and sends a positive acknowledgement to the transmitter; the transmitter then sends the next word. However, if there are some errors then the receiver rejects the word and sends a negative acknowledgement to the transmitter; the transmitter then sends the same word again. This process continues till the receiver gets the correct word. When the errors are of asymmetric or unidirectional type, some novel schemes of code combing are proposed. Here, instead of discarding the corrupted word at the receiver end, it is combined with the next transmitted (same) word using bit-by-bit OR or AND operation. The performance analysis of these methods will be investigated. The applications of these low cost error control schemes for many computer and communication systems will be evaluated.","title":"Some Low Cost Error Control Coding Techniques for Computer Systems","awardID":"0701452","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2011-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4710","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["486183"],"PO":["562984"]},"130302":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/><br\/>Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE)<br\/>Division Computer and Network Systems (CNS)<br\/>Science of Design (SoD) Program<br\/><br\/>Proposal Number: 0725354 <br\/>P\/I: Todd Millstein <br\/>PI Department: Computer Science <br\/>Institution: University of California - Los Angeles<br\/>Award: $ 800,000<br\/><br\/>Title: \"\"SoD: An Electronic Design Automation Approach to Embedded Networked Software\"\"<br\/><br\/>This project adapts design approaches from the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) domain to improve the reliability and flexibility of software-intensive systems. In particular, the project develops methodologies, languages, and tools for designing embedded networked (EN) systems software. This project (based in UCLA with a sub-award to USC) is motivated by the EDA top-down design methodologies employed for hardware; the project develops languages and tools that adapt the EDA approach to the design and implementation of software systems. EN systems (which consist of a distributed collection of computing resources embedded in the physical world) are becoming increasingly important in both scientific and social applications (for example, earthquake prediction, contaminant tracking in ground water, soil erosion detection, traffic monitoring, etc.). The EDA design methodology is a logical foundation for designing software intensive systems because it articulates a design flow that contains a number of stages, which successively lower a high-level design until a fully specified hardware system is produced. Developers of EN systems need to describe the global behavior of their designs independent of the nonfunctional constraints, to make important domain knowledge and constraints from the physical world explicit, and to incorporate these properties into the development process in a staged manner. As EN systems move into the mainstream and software engineers outside of research laboratories take on the challenge of building of such systems, the need for sound software design methodologies and tools grows. The approach pursued with this project can greatly simplify the design of software for this important class of systems and thereby accelerate adoption.<br\/><br\/><br\/>Program Manager: Anita J.

To date, progress in the design of advanced materials via self-assembly or directed assembly has been largely empirical, with limited theoretical understanding or control of the self-assembly process. At the most fundamental level, one would like to understand how a given state of mesoscale or macroscale self-assembly is encoded in the chemical structure of its molecular constituents, and to exploit this understanding to design tailor-made materials with specific desired properties. This research involves the development of thermodynamic steering, a set of novel computational methods for the first-principles design of advanced materials by active steering of a statistical mechanical system through chemical structure space toward a target state having prescribed collective properties.<br\/> <br\/>Thermodynamic steering involves mapping the free-energy landscape of self-assembling materials as a function of chemical structure over a range of thermodynamic conditions to identify microscopic constituents that self-assemble into a specified target structure. This is challenging because the 'search space' (the space of all possible chemical variations of microscopic constituents) and the 'target space' (the space of all competing states of mesoscale or macroscale self-assembly) are very high-dimensional spaces, precluding systematic exploration. These challenges are addressed through implementation of importance sampling methods for preferentially exploring the most relevant regions of search space, development of algorithms for rapidly generating libraries of competing thermodynamic states, application of modern methods for free energy computation in molecular simulations, and efficient use of parallel computing clusters. This methodology is applied to the design of spherical colloids that spontaneously assemble into unusual crystal structures (e.g., the diamond lattice).","title":"Collaborative Research: Directed Design of Self-Assembling Materials: Enabling therModynamic Steering on Parallel computing clusters","awardID":"0653648","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2008-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["544020"],"PO":["565272"]},"125858":{"abstract":"Abstract<br\/><br\/>Title: Integrating the Local and Global Structure of Natural Scenes<br\/>PI: Michael Lewicki, CMU<br\/>Co-PI: Aude Oliva, MIT<br\/><br\/><br\/>One of the fundamental problems in modeling human vision is understanding the visual cues and computations that underlie the perception of natural visual scenes. Recent studies have suggested that there exist important aspects of scene perception which do not depend on the recognition of objects in the scene and are more global or holistic in nature. The objective of this proposal is to use integrated theoretical and experimental approaches to gain insight into the information processing that underlies the representation of natural scenes and the computation of their global and spatial layout properties. The research will be driven by the theoretical hypothesis that visual system representations at both a local and global level are adapted to the statistical structure of the natural images and scenes. This project will investigate local structure of natural images by developing hierarchical statistical models of local textures and testing to what extent human observers are sensitive to the same statistical features. The spatial structure of natural images will be investigated by developing statistical models that identify scene regions over which there are smooth changes in the local texture distribution and comparing the resulting segmentation to that of human observers. The global structure of natural scenes will be investigated by developing a statistical model that learns holistic, statistical representations, with the aim to evaluate scene depth and spatial layout information as human observers do.<br\/>The broader impact of this work is that it will develop theoretical models that can be directly tested at a perceptual level and are also sufficiently detailed that they could lead to testable models of the <br\/>underlying neural mechanisms.

The conditions under which the increase in efficiency and security from tailoring the memory system to the application via reconfigurability outweighs the VLSI overheads of adding that reconfigurability will be investigated. How reconfigurability can be used to increase the robustness and yield of digital ICs by allowing the memory to adapt to process, voltage, and temperature variations and mask faults occurring at manufacture-time and after deployment will also be investigated.

However, atomic-scale objects can also see the near-field. It follows that the precise fabrication of nano metallic clusters can bridge the gap between near-field and far-field, resulting in a whole new generation of optical materials and devices with precisely engineered optical properties. To achieve these goals, the precise fabrication of nano-metallic structures is required, with feature sizes on the scale of a few nanometers. A novel controlled assembly process for metallic nano-structures will combine the best features of chemical self-assembly and nano-lithography, while eliminating the disadvantages of each. This is done by doping through combined electrochemical and mechanical stimulation using a scanning probe microscope (SPM), followed by controlled nano-metal growth and\/or stabilization. This controlled-assembly technique enables nanoscale positioning precision, is able to produce high-crystal-quality metal, and be reproducible, even for complex metallic structures as needed for wafer-integrated fabrication.

In contrast with the traditional use of prediction and transforms, the coding performance cannot be maximized by removing all the correlation within each observed data sequence.

Rather than a \"top down\" approach, defining large masses in 3D and refining and decorating these masses, designs will be developed from sketches and photographs of varying levels of detail arranged by the user in a 3D environment. Unlike any current design system, the sketches and images do not need to represent geometrically- consistent representations of the structure during the design phase. The designer can experiment with different variations in form and detail in a view without struggling with a system that automatically changes other views. This freedom is made possible by representing the design as strokes and pixels only. The system will allow the user to tour the 2D sketches and photographs in a manner that lets the model emerge by the fusion of images by the user's own visual system.<br\/>After the design is refined by multiple iterations of sketches that converge to a nearly consistent representation, computer vision techniques could be used to extract a 3D model from the users input. The advantage of the approach is that the user works in a familiar 2D mode for defining details, without the limitations and time delays of a full 3D model being defined at each step in the process.<br\/>Intellectual Merit: In exploring the middle ground between sketch and object, the proposed work addresses one of the \"holy grail\" problems in interactive 3D graphics how to move seamlessly between 2D and 3D.

Silver, Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, <br\/>Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey<br\/><br\/>Research Abstract:<br\/><br\/>3D data (from 3D imaging, simulations, sensing) is prevalent in many scientific fields such as medicine, biology, engineering, psychology, security & screening, and archeology. However, the effective exploration of 3D data is still a challenging task. <br\/>Especially difficult is the planning of a complex 3D procedure based solely on the limited interaction available, such as rotation and slicing. In science, medicine and engineering, hand-drawn illustrations often include manipulating part of an object to depict the stages and the outcomes of a procedure or process. These illustrations help to uncover hidden features or reveal the spatial relationship between different components of the object.<br\/>This research involves the exploration of a more \"active\" set of visualization techniques for 3D that mimic styles in illustrations and which will allow querying of 3D data using manipulations such as cutting, pulling and peeling. <br\/><br\/>The techniques are based on the concept of \"illustrative deformation\". Illustrative deformation is a non-physically-based means for specifying and realizing visualizations that contain cuts, dissections, distortions, and various other forms of deformation that are not present in the original data. The deformation is represented through iconic operators which are applied to a 3D dataset much like a texture is applied to a polygonal model. By using inverse rendering and correct normal calculation of the newly created surfaces, high-quality illustration-like images can be achieved at interactive speeds. This research is investigating, developing and validating a 3D interaction paradigm through illustrative deformation.","title":"Illustrative Deformation","awardID":"0702407","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2011-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["524497"],"PO":["532791"]},"125191":{"abstract":"Collaborative Proposal ID(s):702434, 0702410<br\/>PI names: Alvin Lebeck, Sean Washburn<br\/>Institutions: Duke University, U of North Carolina<br\/>Title: Circuit and System Architectures for Self-assembled Nano-scale Computers<br\/><br\/><br\/>Abstract<br\/>The rapid advances in computing enjoyed over the last two\/three decades have depended heavily on the continued decrease of CMOS transistor sizes.

Coupled with the potential to position molecular-scale components in complex networks, self-assembly is becoming a potent disruptive technology with potentially significant influence on the production of future integrated circuits and microprocessors. Specifically, by leveraging the larger-than-silicon industrial base of chemical manufacturing this research has the potential to create a sea change in the cost model for the fabrication of computer systems.<br\/><br\/>New technologies, such as self-assembly, bring new challenges for the creation of computing systems.

This makes it possible to integrate hundreds of IP cores running multiple applications simultaneously. However, as CMOS technology approaches the nanoscale domain, increased power consumption, lack of scalability in communication, and reliability of the design at such small sizes make it impractical to build affordable multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs) using the existing design methodologies and software tools. Consequently, this project explores the communication-based design as a new paradigm to design the future MPSoCs. More precisely, we propose automated communication architecture synthesis for application-specific Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) where many heterogeneous IP cores communicate via packet switching, similarly to techniques used most commonly over the Internet. The main promise behind our NoC approach is to achieve a truly scalable and energy-efficient solution for on-chip communication, while maintaining manageable design efforts as Moore's law continues to increase chip complexity year after year.","title":"Design Methods and Optimization Techniques for Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chip (MPSoCs)","awardID":"0702420","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2010-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["554461"],"PO":["562984"]},"129581":{"abstract":"This CPATH CB project builds an intercollegiate and multi-disciplinary community of faculty promoting the education of entrepreneurially-oriented robotics engineering students through engagement in a Robotics Innovations Competition and Conference.<br\/><br\/>This project will involve several community-building phases featuring workshops that will architect the competition, prepare the resource materials, provide a forum for participating university faculty and students and conclude with the first regional competition and conference.

First, due to decreasing feature size of CMOS technology, and increasing clock frequency in the gigahertz range, the clock period is diminishing towards a limit where efficient synchronous clocking throughout the chip is getting difficult. Second, IP reuse based System on Chip (SoC) design becomes easier if all IPs do not have to be optimized for the same clocking scheme, and finally, increasing power consumption in clock buffers, global repeaters and clock tree is a growing industrial concern.<br\/><br\/>However, correctly designing GALS systems is error prone and difficult.<br\/>Asynchronous design tools and methodologies are almost nonexistent outside academia with a few exceptions. Research towards tools and methodologies for GALS design is imperative. Given the subtlety and complexity of these problems, we believe that grounding any GALS methodology in formal methods is important and necessary. Real implementation of protocols into on-chip fabrics and experimental validation of the efficacy of such designs is necessary for the wide acceptance of the design methodologies.<br\/><br\/>In this project, the Virginia Polytechnic and State University and the University of Utah teams will collaborate to develop a formal basis for designing and experimenting with the trade-offs of various GALS solutions, and actually fabricate such solutions on-chip to calibrate the solutions.<br\/><br\/>Other than the research and educational impact of inventing new GALS techniques, and methodologies for formally capturing the protocols and verifying them, the broader impact of this project will constitute collaborative team work and training of students to work in a distributed development environment, inclusion of undergraduate researchers into research, and special effort of including minority students into the project.","title":"CPA: Collaborative Research: Formal Techniques for Designing Globally Asynchronous and Locally Synchronous Systems (FMGALS)","awardID":"0702316","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2012-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7945","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYST"}}],"PIcoPI":["384407"],"PO":["562984"]},"126392":{"abstract":"Proposal #: CNS 07-09217 07-07874 07-07701<br\/>PI(s): Leavens, Gary T.

However, many software libraries provide complex interfaces to make the library adaptable to application-specific needs. This complexity raises the cost of adoption and reduces the benefits of software reuse. Researchers discovered that libraries can be made more versatile and easier to use if the underlying programming language provides library authors with constructs for reasoning, during the compilation of the application, about program metadata and for customizing the library implementation based on this information. Current programming languages provide these features in an immature form and the state of the art in programming language theory does not yet reach this combination of features. The investigators are advancing the theory to bring type safety and modularity to this context and they are working closely with the C++ Standards Committee to transfer their results to industrial practice.<br\/><br\/>The combination of language features needed to reason about metadata and customize libraries is called reflective metaprogramming. Previous research in this area provides type safety and modularity for metaprogramming but not reflective metaprogramming.

By developing a more reliable and expressive metaprogramming system, this research improves programmer productivity for both the developers and users of software libraries because many more bugs will be caught early in the development cycle by the modular type system.","title":"Collaborative Research: Modular Metaprogramming","awardID":"0702362","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2011-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["564351"],"PO":["565272"]},"128240":{"abstract":"Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags embedded in objects will become the standard way to identify objects to provide the link between the physical and cyber worlds.

In his CPATH project, Dr. Denning articulates both a broad vision for revitalizing undergraduate computing education in the nation and an implementation plan for building community around those revitalization efforts. His project vision is to support U.S. competitiveness by stimulating a greater supply of talented, innovative people in computing. The objectives are to design a new operating model for computing education and, with support from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Education Board, involve computing departments in experiments with the model. The new model will be true to fundamental computing principles, emphasize innovation by individual faculty, students, and departments, and support faculty in their roles as mentors and coaches. A key component of the community building aspect of this project is that this project will design support networks and structures that can be administered by ACM to sustain the ideas from workshops. And, the workshops will support the leadership development of at least two dozen innovative junior leaders of the field. In this context, the PI will organize three invited workshops and a comprehensive final report. The first, a Great Principles Workshop, will seek agreement on a presentation of fundamental principles of computing, commitments from experts to write principle stories, and establishment of an ACM Great Principles Library populated initially with materials written by the commissioned experts. The second workshop, a Stimulating Innovation in Curriculum Workshop, will recognize innovators and publicize their innovations, initiate an Innovators Portal containing innovation descriptions and guidelines for other departments to imitate, initiate an Innovation Practice Workshop to help faculty learn foundational innovation and coaching practices, and develop a support network for innovators. The third workshop involves an exploration of an alternative operating model. A Project-Based Learning Workshop will explore the intricacies of a project-based curriculum and help those who want to adopt project-based learning in their own departments. After the workshops the PI will integrate workshop findings and recommendations into A Report on a New Operating Model for Computing Curricula and work with the ACM Education Board to implement the recommended support structures. This project will help computing departments reestablish themselves as places of innovation and attract students. The principles framework will enhance the reputation of computing as a well-grounded science and engineering field. Ultimately, the outcomes of this project should contribute to enhancing national competitiveness in computing by attracting some of the brightest and best students to computing careers. The outcomes of this CPATH CDEF project are likely to have far-reaching and critical impacts on educational institutions in the nation. These outcomes address many of the current problems faced by the field and propose a sound solution.","title":"CPATH-CDEF: Resparking Innovation in Computing Education","awardID":"0720999","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2010-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1709","name":"CISE EDUCAT RES & CURRIC DEVEL"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7640","name":"CPATH"}}],"PIcoPI":["425035"],"PO":["564181"]},"126480":{"abstract":"Proposal #: CNS 07-09217 07-07874 07-07701<br\/>PI(s): Leavens, Gary T.

Enhance JML's infrastructure including its type checker, runtime assertion checking compiler, and IDE support;<br\/>. Make JML's software infrastructure more extensible; <br\/>. Substantially improve the documentation of the language and its supporting tools; <br\/>. Develop course materials and tutorials to facilitate classroom use of JML; and<br\/>. Disseminate a well-documented, extensible, open source suite of enhanced JML tools.<br\/>JML (Java Modeling Language), a formal specification language that can document detailed designs of Java and interfaces, has been used in different projects with great benefit. Feedback is obtained from users who are attracted by the ability to check Java code against JML specifications using a variety of tools. New research problems, however, are forcing re-inventing the infrastructure that JML provides, slowing the innovation, since JML does not support many of the new features of Java version 5, most notably generics. The Verified Software grand challenge has identified lack of extensible tools for formal methods research as a major impediment to experimentation. This project responds to the challenge by enhancing, extending, and well-documenting the infrastructure to advance and accelerate Java formal methods research.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The infrastructure is expected to open barriers to formal methods adoption among software engineering professionals by endowing a large collection of tools that share a common, mature specification language. These advantages should attract more educators and improve reliability in safety- and mission-critical systems. Moreover, strengthening the formal methods component in software engineering curriculum, courses will be developed and targeted to undergraduate research,. The collaborative involves two minority-serving institutions and an institution in an EPSCoR state.","title":"Collaborative Research: CRI: CRD: A JML Community Infrastructure --Revitalizing Tools and Documentation to Aid Formal Methods Research","awardID":"0708330","effectiveDate":"2007-07-15","expirationDate":"2011-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7359","name":"COMPUTING RES INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["521696"],"PO":["557609"]},"125281":{"abstract":"This research develops visualization methods that aid decision-making by exposing the important data characteristics and their inherent uncertainties in meaningful ways. The goal of visualization is to gain insight and understanding by creating visual representations of complex information. Most visualization methods use some form of classification to eliminate unimportant regions and illuminate interesting ones. The process of classification is inherently uncertain; in general the source data contains noise, data transformations can further introduce and magnify uncertainty. More advanced classification methods rely on approximation models or statistical methods to determine features of interest. While these classification methods can model uncertainty or partial memberships, they typically only provide discrete memberships. Visualization methods must provide the user access to uncertainty in classification or image generation if the results of the visualization are to be trusted. <br\/><br\/>This work makes the concept of uncertainty a central component of visualization. Users should be able to assess uncertainty, and therefore potential for error, while exploring the space of possibility with respect to concrete realizations of ambiguous features. This research achieves the following: (1) development of new visualization methods that expose uncertainty to users in a meaningful way, (2) adaptation of advanced classification algorithms so that partial class probabilities, and therefore uncertainty, are preserved, and (3) development a rigorous validation system based on generated ground truth models and simulated acquisition. The semantic meaning of uncertainty is a guiding principle of this work. This means that when data are processed and classified, a range of possible variations are realizable as a consequence of uncertainty. Contrast this with a syntactic approach, where descriptions such as fuzziness and noise are taken literally, and are used as visual metaphors to indicate uncertainty. This research shows that semantic methods of image representation and interaction are more amenable to expert analysis and hypothesis testing.","title":"Visualization with Uncertainty","awardID":"0702787","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2009-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":["431150"],"PO":["532791"]},"125194":{"abstract":"Collaborative Proposal ID(s):702434, 0702410<br\/>PI names: Alvin Lebeck, Sean Washburn<br\/>Institutions: Duke University, U of North Carolina<br\/>Title: Circuit and System Architectures for Self-assembled Nano-scale Computers<br\/><br\/><br\/>Abstract<br\/>The rapid advances in computing enjoyed over the last two\/three decades have depended heavily on the continued decrease of CMOS transistor sizes. Unfortunately, the capacity for CMOS to continue this trend is finite and will be reached in the near future. This is beyond idle speculation and the semiconductor industry has at present identified the replacement of CMOS as an important, but difficult technological challenge. This research project seeks to develop alternatives to conventional computer system design and fabrication that will be fundamentally important as technology moves past the convenient abstractions built during the first 50+ years of computing.<br\/><br\/>Self-assembled nanoscale systems are a potential candidate for replacing silicon CMOS technologies because of the ability to fabricate nanoscale structures in vast numbers without the need for multi-billion dollar facilities. Coupled with the potential to position molecular-scale components in complex networks, self-assembly is becoming a potent disruptive technology with potentially significant influence on the production of future integrated circuits and microprocessors. Specifically, by leveraging the larger-than-silicon industrial base of chemical manufacturing this research has the potential to create a sea change in the cost model for the fabrication of computer systems.<br\/><br\/>New technologies, such as self-assembly, bring new challenges for the creation of computing systems. The research components of this proposal seek to address the following challenges: 1.) designing high-performance, low-power computer architectures that match the fabrication characteristics of future nanotechnologies, 2.) design and test nanoscale circuits with a focus on device parameter variation, defect modeling and test generation, and automated tools for circuit layout, and 3.) fabrication and characterization of \"proof-of-principle\" novel self-assembled nanoscale devices (RGFET) and circuits.","title":"Collaborative: Circuit and System Architectures for Self-assembled Nanoscale Computers","awardID":"0702434","effectiveDate":"2007-07-15","expirationDate":"2012-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2878","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CCF"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7945","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYST"}}],"PIcoPI":["506171","555929","518001"],"PO":["562984"]},"129572":{"abstract":"This CPATH Community Building (CB) project addresses disjointed educational approaches to discipline-specific computing and generic computer literacy that do not reflect the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed by engineers in the workplace. <br\/><br\/>Computing in the workplace is pervasive, involving many complex tools, many approaches to problem solving, strategic decision making, and synthesis.

The availability of massive computing horsepower to everyday users would provide benefits in many domains, including scientific, consumer, and business, as more sophisticated applications could be created and used. Computationally intensive applications such as pharmaceutical development, scientific simulation, and financial forecasting could be run on a desktop computer, providing faster and cheaper access to the results of these vital applications. However, the small size of the transistors that will be used in future multicore chips with hundreds of processors will make the computer system exceptionally fragile. With small transistors, it becomes more difficult to avoid introducing defects and variations in operational characteristics during chip manufacturing. These defects and variations can cause hardware failures. This problem is particularly pronounced in transistor devices used to implement on-chip memory. Because a multicore chip will have hundreds of millions of memory transistors, it is likely that a particular chip may not operate correctly. Indeed, there will be few fully functional chips, which will be expensive due to their scarcity. If future multicore chips are to attain their promise for low cost desktop computing, the obstacles posed by failures in memory must be addressed. <br\/><br\/>This research proposes the new concept of ?soft yield,? where defects and operational variations remain during chip manufacture, but are virtually repaired after chip deployment. Based on soft yield, a novel approach, called Test and Continuous Adaptive Repair (T-CAR), is proposed to mitigate the impact of defects and operational variations in memory transistors. T-CAR plans for failed memory components by identifying the conditions that lead to failure and repairing the memory to account for those conditions. The approach makes repairs by reconfiguring the hardware as a software application runs to avoid harming application performance. The intellectual impact of this research will be to develop new test and repair algorithms, mechanisms for hardware repair, and models and metrics to evaluate the benefit of soft yield. The societal broader impact is to develop more capable, reliable and lower cost systems, which will lead to a new class of consumer, business and scientific applications. The project will also train Ph.D. graduate students to serve as future educators, scientists and engineers equiped to deal with this emerging reliability problem.","title":"Yield and Reliability Enhancement for On-Chip Multicore Memories in Nanoscale Technology","awardID":"0702236","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2011-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["560516","475186"],"PO":["559883"]},"129595":{"abstract":"0722274<br\/>CPATH CDEF: Interdisciplinary Problem- and Case-based Computer Science<br\/>Owen Astrachan<br\/><br\/>This CPATH CISE Distinguished Education Fellow (CDEF) award to Dr. Owen Astrachan recognizes his role as an accomplished, creative, and innovative leader who serves the nation as a spokeperson and force for change in undergraduate computing education. CDEF awards are made to individuals who have achieved distinction in the computing profession, who are committed to transforming undergraduate computing education, and who have innovative ideas on how to do so. Dr. Astrachan's CDEF project focuses on the development and deployment of instructional materials to introduce Computer Science to majors across many fields. The research and approach build on the successful models of Case-Based learning and Problem-Based learning which are standard practices in business and medical schools, respectively. This approach will relate new knowledge and techniques from computer science to what students already know, e.g., how to use iTunes, why humans are similar to chimpanzees, or why blogs and wikis have transformative effects. The problems used in a Problem Based learning setting are authentic and are typically open-ended in that they can be approached, answered, and justified in more than one way. The model for Computer Science Education has remained largely unchanged in the past twenty years despite a thousand-fold increase in computing power and an unprecedented change in how society and science use technology. This project develops a process and materials to transform both what is taught and learned about computer science and how it is taught. The approach and materials are interdisciplinary as is the advisory board that has oversight for the project. The materials developed are aimed at both traditional computer science students and more broadly at students in other fields who remain largely unaware of the transformative tools, methods, and technologies that are part of the foundation of computer science. The extent to which Problem Based learning is made part of a course or curriculum and the type of Problem Based learning exercises developed depend on student population and experience, the goals of the course, the extent to which faculty are on board, and the resources committed to the process. An intrinsic aspect of the project is a cross-institution, collaborative, and interdisciplinary approach combining faculty and undergraduates to develop, test, and widely disseminate the approach. Well-designed and implemented Problem-Based learning modules will attract and be effective with a group of students beyond those considering computer as software engineering or mathematics. Using an approach with a track-record in medicine and business, but also with proven success in postsecondary biology and engineering courses will encourage new approaches and attract new audiences to computer science. The interdisciplinary character of the modules will necessarily have a broader impact than traditional, engineering and science approaches. The dimensions of effectiveness for Problem Based learning cut across learning style and gender as well as discipline.","title":"CPATH CDEF: Interdisciplinary Problem- and Case-based Computer Science","awardID":"0722274","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2012-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7640","name":"CPATH"}}],"PIcoPI":["531300"],"PO":["565264"]},"125151":{"abstract":"Concurrency is an increasingly important area of study as commodity parallel multi-core processors (such as Intel's Core processors) enter the mainstream.<br\/>At the same time, mainstream programming languages such as Java and C# support both concurrent programming and automatic memory management (so-called \"garbage collection\" or GC). Ordinary programmers expect their programming platforms to yield both responsiveness and performance for their applications running on commodity parallel computers. This project explores new approaches to GC that exploit hardware parallelism to retain and improve desirable space\/time performance characteristics for programs. It will benefit the hardware industry by exploiting their new multi-core offerings, while contributing to economic and national security by enhancing usability, performance, and reliability of software.

The project is devising new approaches for automatic compaction of dynamically allocated data, with emphasis on techniques that allow compaction to occur concurrently (i.e., in parallel) with the application.

Feedback will be provided by each member of the faculty panel, as well as by the other student participants, and will help student participants understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, whether their results are being appropriately analyzed and presented, etc. Students will have an opportunity to interact more informally with the faculty (and additional guests) during lunch and dinner on the Consortium day. The poster session scheduled for the second day of the technical program will afford student participants a chance to present their work to conference attendees in general. The organizers of the Consortium will make a special effort to attract participants from under-represented communities, and to reach beyond the traditional CSCW research community. NSF funding will provide support for the domestic travel and lodging of the students, as well as the direct expenses of putting on the event.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The Group07 Doctoral Consortium will bring together the best of the next generation of organizational systems, information systems, social informatics, and computer supported cooperative work researchers. The event will allow them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers, and this will play a major role in their enculturation into the profession. Since the students and faculty will constitute a diverse group along several dimensions, the students' horizons will be broadened at a critical stage in their professional development.","title":"Group07 Doctoral Consortium to be held on November 4-7, 2007 in Sanibel Island, Florida","awardID":"0733941","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2009-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["430298","498457"],"PO":["565227"]},"136493":{"abstract":"Proposal Number: NSF-0433540<br\/><br\/>Title: Security Through Interaction Modeling (STIM)<br\/><br\/>PI: Michael Reiter<br\/><br\/>Computer misuse is often easier to recognize in particular instances than it is to specify in general, and is highly sensitive to experience and context. Nevertheless, few computer security technologies, if any, adequately utilize models of experience and context in defending against misuse. This research explores the thesis that many computer defenses can be dramatically improved, in both efficacy and usability, by modeling experience and context in a way that allows the models to become an integral element for defending the system. The interactions that can be modeled and potentially exploited are ubiquitous---they exist among persons (e.g., different user roles in access control), among computers and networks (e.g., what computers and networks typically correspond with what others), and even among attacks (e.g., what attacks realize the preconditions of others). Developing security technologies that better utilize such interactions forms the core of the research agenda in \"security through interaction modeling\" (STIM). This effort promises advances in diverse areas of security technology, such as attack traffic filtering, more usable authorization systems, and intrusion detection and response. A central goal of the STIM activity is education and outreach. Its efforts here include the construction of a security education portal and cybersecurity curricula for many education levels, ranging from children through college faculty.","title":"CyberTrust Center: Security Through Interaction Modeling (STIM)","awardID":"0756998","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2012-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"024F","name":"GENI CONCEPT\/DEVELOPMENT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7371","name":"CYBER TRUST"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7456","name":"ITR-CYBERTRUST"}}],"PIcoPI":["553884"],"PO":["565327"]},"126461":{"abstract":"This project is to design, develop, and disseminate software infrastructure to support research and education in automated deduction and formal methods.

However, many software libraries provide complex interfaces to make the library adaptable to application-specific needs. This complexity raises the cost of adoption and reduces the benefits of software reuse. Researchers discovered that libraries can be made more versatile and easier to use if the underlying programming language provides library authors with constructs for reasoning, during the compilation of the application, about program metadata and for customizing the library implementation based on this information. Current programming languages provide these features in an immature form and the state of the art in programming language theory does not yet reach this combination of features.

Hayes, University of Michigan<br\/>PI Institution: University of Michigan<br\/><br\/>Abstract: <br\/>Current trends in the microelectronics industry are making integrated circuits highly vulnerable to failures whose occurrence is inherently uncertain or non-deterministic. This uncertainty is due to the shrinking of circuit components like logic gates into the nanometer range, where they become susceptible to tiny but random manufacturing defects, transient (soft) errors caused by radiation strikes, and quantum-mechanical effects. In circuits embedded in safety-critical applications such as vehicle control, the consequences of such uncertainty can be catastrophic. Most conventional methods of circuit analysis are deterministic, and cannot deal efficiently with problems of the above type. This project seeks a fundamental understanding of uncertainty and its role in logic circuit design and operation. It is pursuing a unified approach to analyzing, designing and testing circuits in the presence of non-deterministic behavior. It will apply and extend several powerful concepts, methods, and software tools developed in our group, such as the QuIDDPro simulator program for quantum circuits. Three major issues will be addressed: (i) development of logic models to represent non-deterministic faults and errors, (ii) circuit synthesis (hardening) methods to achieve specified levels of error tolerance, and (iii) algorithms for simulating and testing circuits in the presence of uncertain behavior. The results obtained should be of direct interest to circuit designers and design tool developers in the U.S. microelectronics industry and in the nascent nanotechnology field.","title":"Circuit Analysis, Synthesis and Test under Uncertainty","awardID":"0702276","effectiveDate":"2007-07-15","expirationDate":"2011-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["549712"],"PO":["562984"]},"125284":{"abstract":"ID: 0702797 <br\/>Title: Cross-Layer Error Exploitation for Next Generation SoCs <br\/>PI name: Nik Dutt<br\/>PI Inst: UC Irvine<br\/><br\/>Abstract<br\/>Today's communication appliances (e.g., PDA phones, GPS units, etc.) are a synergy of many technologies such as communication, video, image, and voice. What is common among these technologies is the fact that they exhibit (either by design, or by their intrinsic nature) a resiliency to errors. The user will hardly notice, for example, a dark pixel in an image or a video. When transmitting information wirelessly, on the other hand, errors are expected to occur over the air and receivers are designed to correct for such errors. By contrast, today's chips are designed to be error free and those chips that have non-fixable defects are discarded. While advanced semiconductor manufacturing technologies allow the fabrication of ever more complex Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) in small die sizes, it becomes economically impractical to achieve a 100% error-free chip design due to the large number of transistors per unit area as well as their proximity. For mobile applications, a paradigm shift away from 100% correctness is not only feasible, but seemingly unavoidable. The outcome of this project will result in a structured and scientific approach to exploit error-awareness across multiple abstraction levels of complex SoCs. A holistic integration of traditionally disparate (abstraction-level specific) techniques will allow system designers to rapidly explore complex chip implementations to meet a wide range of power, performance, and cost attributes. In the long term, this project will positively impact both ends of the producer-consumer chain: chip manufacturing companies will improve their productivity and become more competitive by allowing efficient fabrication of mobile chips; and consumers will benefit through lower cost mobile chips that allow longer operation of their mobile appliances while ensuring safe and correct execution of emerging applications.","title":"Cross-Layer Error Exploitation for Next Generation SoCs","awardID":"0702797","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2011-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["472357","541836","544662"],"PO":["562984"]},"125175":{"abstract":"Technology scaling has enabled tremendous growth in the integrated circuits (IC) industry over the past few decades.

Although certain fields may be mature in themselves, the connection of such fields can be new, and can present a wealth of possibilities for research. The motivation behind our work is the conviction that similar benefits can be had when different domains within a single field are combined; in our case, that field is signal processing. The main domain of application of this work is digital signal processors, i.e. hardware that processes digital signals consisting of ones and zeros, which are for example found in modern computers. The second domain in this cross-disciplinary work is analog signals and systems, i.e. signals as they occur in the physical world, and the systems that are used to handle them. <br\/><br\/>The work has two components. The first component uses the concept of accompanding\" (compressing-expanding), which has been very successfully applied in the past to analog systems for voice transmission and audio recording (e.g., in the ubiquitous Dolby system). This process varies the magnitude of signals dynamically, to ensure that they are always large enough so that they do not get contaminated by noise. Direct application of this technique to digital signal processors fails completely, as it does not take into account the dynamics inside such processors. The PI is developing a general mathematical framework for eliminating this problem, using concepts from externally linear, internally nonlinear systems, which has been already developed for analog systems under prior NSF funding. The results can be used to obtain much better performance from digital signal processors of the fixed-point kind, without having to increase the number of bits used in them, thus keeping their power dissipation low a key advantage in the ubiquitous portable applications, which require low energy drain from a battery.<br\/><br\/>The second component of the work uses digital signals as functions of continuous time, for real-time signal processing applications; the signals are still ones and zeros, but are defined for all time, rather than at discrete time instants as in classical computing and digital signal processing. We are developing a theory to handle such signals and study the properties of the systems that use them. Preliminary work has shown that continuous-time operation can make possible a much lower error, and in addition makes possible hardware which has signal-depended power dissipation, with the power decreasing toward zero as the signal activity decreases. Again, a key advantage of this technique is the low energy drain in portable applications. The plan is to fully test ideas with a silicon chip custom-designed for this purpose.","title":"Analog-Inspired Digital Signal Processors","awardID":"0701766","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2010-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4710","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["526881"],"PO":["562984"]},"125198":{"abstract":"Given the advances in imaging technology for medicine and science, an increasing number of volume datasets (3D arrays of scalar values) are being generated, producing an overwhelming flood of raw 3D data that must be processed, viewed and analyzed.

Many of the advanced special effects in movies utilize physical simulation to produce computer-generated floods and fluid flows. The computational fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations for these effects are usually performed on a regular 3D grid and produce dynamic volume datasets. Given these multiple sources of volumetric datasets, there is a great need for powerful implicit model editing capabilities.

Gaps exists between the skills needed by IT industries and those posessed by new hires. Education and experiences of graduates of typical U.S. undergraduate computing programs may be out of sync with national needs. While organizations today face an imperative to innovate in order to drive growth and remain competitive, most graduates lack the entrepreneurial skills to serve as change agents, understanding of such important business concepts as market needs, or a vision of future technology directions. This project, titled NEWPATH, is aimed at addressing these challenges. NEWPATH will produce graduates who have solid command of computing technologies, a vision of technology advancement directions, understanding of the needs of the market, and, perhaps most importantly, real entrepreneurial experiences in the IT world. Graduates will be ready to become key members of entrepreneurial teams in established IT companies or to lead their own IT start-ups.<br\/><br\/>The NEWPATH plan is designed to produce graduates in computing who will become industry world leaders as a result of having gained significant knowledge, training, and crucial experience in entrepreneurial activities before graduation. A key component of the program is an intense six-month immersion, immediately prior to graduation, in which students in the program form small entrepreneurial teams that attempt to create a model start-up through all phases of the process, including ideation, developing business plans, seeking venture capital, designing and building an IT product\/service, marketing, etc. While the experience of creating and successfully running an IT start-up would be extremely valuable in preparing students for their future professional careers in the IT industry, the experience of going through the initial stages of setting up such a start-up, even the experience of creating a start-up that actually fails, can be of almost equal value in preparing students for IT industry leadership.<br\/><br\/>This project has the potential to serve as a national undergraduate computing education model. Students will pursue technical educational mastery plus they will acquire knowledge and experience sufficient to: <br\/>-Identify potential business opportunities in the IT industry, either in the form of new products, tools, and services, or innovative applications of existing products, tools, and services; <br\/>-Evaluate the resources needed, the potential rewards, and the potential risks in pursuing new opportunities; <br\/>-Perform realistic evaluations of competing products and the potential for success or failure against competitors; <br\/>-Effectively persuade venture capital firms and other potential partners of the merits of an entrepreneurial vision. <br\/>-Help organize and work with a multidisciplinary team that takes a potential product or service through market research; attracting venture capital; design and product development; and successfully marketing the product by use of effective, low-cost promotional tools.<br\/><br\/>These are qualities that meet the needs of employers and also address issues of U.

The mobile robot program serves the research community in two ways. First, it provides a venue for demonstrations of the latest research in AI and robotics. Second, robot program activities serve as a terrific opportunity for exposing undergraduate and graduate students to the latest research in AI and for allowing them to make valuable connections early in their research careers. From new approaches to canonical robotics problems to groundbreaking research in emerging areas, the mobile robot program provides a forum for a diverse range of projects in mobile robotics. Recent years have witnessed a rise in the accessibility of mobile robot platforms with reasonably capable platforms being available for relatively low cost and not requiring a substantial effort to build hardware or software architectures. Some participants exhibit a range of projects using commodity robots, while others showcased unique construction. As robots become more accessible, the robot program is able to showcase work from a wide range of contributors. For the past two years, the event has increasingly promoted research projects that encourage human-machine interaction as well as adaptation and learning in natural human settings. This trend is one that will continue in 2007, where the program will include two challenges: Semantic Robot Vision (SRVC) and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).<br\/><br\/>This is funding to support travel to and participation by student teams from the United States in the HRI challenge, which will provide a structured framework that allows teams to compete directly in seven predefined categories that are aimed at human-robot interaction and involve activities that intrinsically integrate perception and action.

The seventh and final category is the integration challenge - that is, a demonstration of an extended, multimodal interaction that combines at least three of the above six categories. Judges will evaluate the AI techniques employed and their level of sophistication. The results of the event will be disseminated through abstracts in the AAAI-07 conference proceedings, through research papers in the proceedings of the mobile robot workshop, and via a summary article in AI Magazine.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The annual AAAI Mobile Robot Competition and Exhibition is the only major venue that establishes and maintains the vital connection between the robotics and AI communities. Thus, these events have the potential to significantly impact robotics education and research.

These trends challenge the state of technology for modeling realistic workloads on sufficiently detailed hardware or system simulators. Computer system designers traditionally rely on simulation experiments to evaluate properties (such as performance, energy consumption, and thermal characteristics) of proposed designs. Unfortunately, growing system complexity renders many traditional simulation-based approaches woefully inefficient or obsolete. The bottom line is that computer designs and workloads have grown sufficiently complex that modeling them fully in detail is utterly intractable.<br\/>Researchers and practitioners lack the necessary tools to understand the many interactions of diverse hardware components and software requirements, and thus there is no assurance that coarse-scale modeling of large design spaces is sufficient to identify design points representing the most important tradeoffs for any given system.<br\/><br\/>The proposed research attacks the problem of exponential design space and configuration space exploration via an automated approach that builds accurate, confident, and predictive models. Sample points in the design space are simulated, and the results are used to teach the models the function describing relationships among design\/configuration parameters. The models produce highly accurate predicted results for other points in the space, can be queried to predict impacts of parameter changes, and are very fast compared to simulation, enabling efficient discovery of tradeoffs among parameters in different regions. The research agenda includes investigating ways to reduce the number of sample points required to develop accurate predictive models, applying the approach to new hardware design spaces, and using predictive modeling to jointly configure software workloads together with the hardware on which they run.","title":"CPA: Towards Designing Complex Systems: Exponential Design\/Configuration\/Parameter Space Exploration Tools That Are Efficient, Accurate, and Easily Usable","awardID":"0702616","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2010-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["449831","359520"],"PO":["366560"]},"129621":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/><br\/>CNS-0722362<br\/>PI: Carlos Jensen<br\/>Institution: Oregon State University<br\/>Title: CPATH CB: Building a Platform for Learning , A Learner Centered Approach to Computer Science Education<br\/><br\/>This CPATH project builds a community around integrating a Platform for Learning model into the computing education of undergraduate students.

While in the past it was sufficient for variability to be addressed at the device and circuit levels (and so abstracted away from the micro-architect), we are reaching a point where designers at the micro-architecture level will need to consider the effects of variability or sacrifice larger and larger amounts of yield and\/or performance. To address these issues, we propose to develop parameterizable variability models for the most common micro-architecture structures used in high-performance processors, ranging from data-path modules to SRAM and CAM arrays. These variability models can then be used to augment any existing single- or multi-core simulation framework and allow for early identification of which micro-architecture decisions are more likely to exacerbate or filter out unwanted variability effects. The project plans to address these issues by proposing models that micro-architects can work with for both 2D and 3Darchitectures, without having to rely on complex device- or circuit-level variability information.<br\/>An integral component of the research proposed here is its impact on educational activities of the PI at Carnegie Mellon University, as well as its overall societal impact via enabling frontier application development. In addition to providing a venue for graduate student research, the proposed research is envisioned to be seamlessly integrated with other educational activities, such as undergraduate, graduate, or minority student mentoring and recruiting, as well as course development or revamping to reflect the continuously changing landscape of next generation system design.","title":"Variability-Energy Interactions at the Microarchitecture to System-Level Interface for 2D and 3D Architectures","awardID":"0702451","effectiveDate":"2007-07-15","expirationDate":"2011-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7945","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYST"}}],"PIcoPI":["554462"],"PO":["562984"]},"126652":{"abstract":"Proposal #: CNS 07-09264 <br\/>PI(s): Mohapatra, Prasant<br\/> Boucher, Virginia; Liu, Xin <br\/>Institution: University of California - Davis<br\/> Davis, Ca 95618-0000<br\/>Title: CRD: QuRiNet: A Wide-Area Outdoor Wireless Mesh Test-Bed<br\/><br\/>Project Proposed:<br\/>This project, building an outdoor mesh Network so that the testbed is an interference free environment, facilitates access, provides measurement data and evaluation results. The testbed complements other testbeds deployed in environments susceptible to external interference. Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have seen increased deployments in the areas of broadband home networking and enterprise networking. In addition, they are also being deployed at the community and municipal level, for extended service provider coverage to end users, and in areas lacking wired infrastructure. This project supports expanding the size, scope, performance, and robustness of current network, and facilitating the access and usability as a community resource. Quail Ridge, used for environmental research by the ecologists at UC Davis, is part of the University of California Natural Reserve System (NRS). The project continues ongoing efforts in the deployment of the Quail Ridge Wireless Mesh Network (QuRiNet) at the Quail Ridge Natural Reserve. It is located about twenty two miles west of Davis. This work in the reserve is expected to provide wireless coverage for over 2,000 acres of hilly terrain in the face of various topological and technological challenges. The mesh network enables a testbed for carrying out further research on the design and development of WMNs. Moreover, it will also be utilized for ecological research to study the flora and fauna in the region. Proposed is the addition of 20 more nodes to the existing 10 in the reserve expanding it to a 30-node mesh network. The status and current progress on QuRiNet are being updated at a web site.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The infrastructure contributes to education and training of students. Part of the research will be used as projects in graduate courses in computer and mobile wireless networks. Moreover, the testbed will be used for evaluation of research ideas.

The propensity for concurrency to engender state-explosion confounds verification, and the tendency for synchronization logic to be interleaved with \"functional\" code complicates understanding and maintenance. Thus, development and long-term maintenance of high-assurance software requires design artifacts over which verification is feasible and processes that use these artifacts to maintain separation of concerns in the implementation.<br\/><br\/>This project aims to achieve these goals. Specifically, it explores a design-for-verification (D4V) approach based on synchronization contracts, which provides the high level of abstraction needed to support verification while maintaining a good separation of synchronization and functional concerns. We are developing programming systems that leverage contract awareness for analysis; to automate the generation of models from design artifacts, (e.g., UML diagrams); and to separate synchronization and functional concerns. We are conducting these explorations in the context of an existing software baseline.<br\/><br\/>The project also involves development of undergraduate courses in concurrent systems design, model-based software engineering, and D4V.

Voice quality is unique to each individual and thus is inextricable from personality, self-image, and the perceptions of others. We can alter our voice to sound like others, attract attention, project confidence, convey authority, and to perform countless other functions. This flexibility of the natural voice is inconceivable using even state-of-the art text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. While voice quality may not matter for many text-to-speech applications, it is essential for assistive communication aids which are meant to be an extension of the user. Over two million Americans have severe speech and motor impairments that require them to use an assistive communication aid, many of whom use TTS to speak on their behalf. The speech output options on commercially available devices are extremely limited. Moreover, the synthetic voices are not representative of the user along basic dimensions such as age, gender, rate of speech, and voice quality thus drawing unnecessary attention and detracting from the content of the spoken message as well as impeding social integration. <br\/><br\/>This project aims to harness the residual vocal control in the productions of individuals with severe speech impairment in order to adapt a text-to-speech synthesizer such that the resultant voice resembles that of the user. Conventional methods of voice morphing cannot be applied directly given the severity of the user's speech impairment. Recent empirical work suggests that children and adults with severe speech impairment retain the ability to control fundamental frequency, accent, rhythm, and speaking rate which are among the many acoustic cues that signal speaker identity. This research will leverage this preserved ability toward building an adaptive text-to-speech synthesizer that conveys the user's identity without degradation of intelligibility. Identity-bearing vocal cues will be elicited from children with severe speech impairment and used to adapt age and gender-matched concatenative synthetic voices using novel voice transformation techniques. Usability tests will be conducted to assess the impact of user identity adaptation on TTS intelligibility, naturalness, and acceptability, the results of which will provide insights for iterative design of TTS adaptation. <br\/><br\/>The research will have broader impact on users of assistive aids and able-bodied users of communication technologies that use speech synthesis. This project strives to make communication accessible and socially fulfilling by designing an enabling technology in which the line between system and user is blurred. The ultimate goal is to afford users of speech synthesis technology the same ownership and individuality as the natural voice. The interdisciplinary nature of this work will promote teaching, training and learning in computer science and in speech and hearing sciences.","title":"Adapting a Text-to-Speech Synthesizer to Convey User Identity","awardID":"0712821","effectiveDate":"2007-07-15","expirationDate":"2011-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["485923"],"PO":["564456"]},"127489":{"abstract":"This work will develop interactive partially observable Markov decision processes (IPOMDPs), which provide a framework for optimal planning that agents can use while interacting with other agents.

Computing infrastructures based on these coarse-grained reconfigurable platforms will be better able to meet the future performance and power demands of embedded applications than traditional processor-based architectures.<br\/><br\/>The potential design space of these large-scale coarse-grained reconfigurable computing architectures is enormous, and efficient, architecture-independent tools will be needed to quickly explore and evaluate the different points in this space for different applications and application domains. This research project will develop architecture-independent tools that map the intermediate representations of algorithms produced by compilers to coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures comprising a wide range of architectural features. These tools will rely on integrating scheduling, placement and routing algorithms to perform this mapping. They will enable the fast exploration of the overall space of large-scale coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures, as well as the impact of specific architectural features and structures.","title":"Tools for Exploring Low-power, High-performance Reconfigurable Computing Architectures","awardID":"0702621","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2011-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7945","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYST"}}],"PIcoPI":["485670","485671"],"PO":["562984"]},"125245":{"abstract":"ID: CCF-0702668<br\/>Project Title: Sequentially Transparent Synthesis<br\/>PI name: Brayton, Robert K. <br\/>Institution: University of California-Berkeley<br\/><br\/><br\/>Abstract:<br\/>Microelectronic devices are already pervasive in our everyday life, from computers to video games. Efficient manufacturing of these devices is key to this country's technology competitiveness and implies automating the design process. Thus, computer-aided design (CAD) software, capable of representing, optimizing, and implementing complex digital systems needs to be researched and continually developed. This is a demanding task and without continual research, development of CAD software will not keep up with the growing demands on the capacity, variety, and speed of designing new digital electronic systems.<br\/><br\/>The proposed work focuses on basic research in the key area of automatically creating and transforming functional descriptions of electronic systems that are being designed. The goal is optimization, targeting criteria that vary depending on the design needs, e.g. optimizing for minimal power consumption, which is important for portable devices, such as cell phones, as well the huge banks of compute servers that power the internet. <br\/><br\/>A primary focus of this research is in an area called sequential synthesis and verification. Most digital systems can be viewed abstractly as finite state machines (FSMs). Most CAD algorithms, which optimize these, work on a very limited view of FSMs by ignoring the memory components (called combinational optimization). This leads to very suboptimal results. Optimizations, which manipulate the memory (sequential optimization) are usually ignored because they are not scalable to large systems, and it is too hard to verify the correctness of the result. The research to be performed (1) advocates a novel representation of FSM functionality that makes sequential optimization and validation easier and (2) unifies several previously unrelated optimization goals, which allows for finding better solutions in shorter time.<br\/><br\/>The project, when successfully completed, will contribute to the research and development of a new generation of efficient CAD software. It will boost designer productivity, lower development costs, and shorten the time to market for the design, implementation, and verification of complex systems.","title":"Sequentially Transparent Synthesis","awardID":"0702668","effectiveDate":"2007-07-01","expirationDate":"2010-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["518632",332351],"PO":["562984"]},"126356":{"abstract":"Proposal #: CNS 07-09217 07-07874 07-07701<br\/>PI(s): Leavens, Gary T.

Enhance JML's infrastructure including its type checker, runtime assertion checking compiler, and IDE support;<br\/>. Make JML's software infrastructure more extensible; <br\/>. Substantially improve the documentation of the language and its supporting tools; <br\/>. Develop course materials and tutorials to facilitate classroom use of JML; and<br\/>. Disseminate a well-documented, extensible, open source suite of enhanced JML tools.<br\/>JML (Java Modeling Language), a formal specification language that can document detailed designs of Java and interfaces, has been used in different projects with great benefit. Feedback is obtained from users who are attracted by the ability to check Java code against JML specifications using a variety of tools. New research problems, however, are forcing re-inventing the infrastructure that JML provides, slowing the innovation, since JML does not support many of the new features of Java version 5, most notably generics. The Verified Software grand challenge has identified lack of extensible tools for formal methods research as a major impediment to experimentation. This project responds to the challenge by enhancing, extending, and well-documenting the infrastructure to advance and accelerate Java formal methods research.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The infrastructure is expected to open barriers to formal methods adoption among software engineering professionals by endowing a large collection of tools that share a common, mature specification language. These advantages should attract more educators and improve reliability in safety- and mission-critical systems. Moreover, strengthening the formal methods component in software engineering curriculum, courses will be developed and targeted to undergraduate research,. The collaborative involves two minority-serving institutions and an institution in an EPSCoR state.","title":"Collaborative Research: CRI: CRD: A JML Community Infrastructure -- Revitalizing Tools and Documentation to Aid Formal Methods Research","awardID":"0707701","effectiveDate":"2007-07-15","expirationDate":"2011-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7359","name":"COMPUTING RES INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":[335239],"PO":["557609"]}}
