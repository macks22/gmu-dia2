As IC feature sizes continue to be scaled below 45 nanometer, copper wires exhibit significant ?size effects? resulting in a sharp rise in their resistivity, which, in turn, has adverse impact both on their performance as well as reliability---in the form of current carrying capacity. This limitation of copper interconnects has been recently highlighted by various leading semiconductor companies around the world as well as in the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), and threatens to slow down or even stall the traditional growth of the semiconductor and related industries. Hence, it is critical to identify and develop new interconnect solutions. <br\/><br\/>Carbon nanotubes, tiny nanostructures 80,000 times narrower than a human hair, are known to have amazing electrical, thermal and mechanical properties, and can potentially address the challenges faced by copper and thereby extend the lifetime of ?electrical interconnects?. Most of these outstanding properties arise from the ?low-dimensionality? of CNTs---since they are essentially 1-dimensional structures. The investigators seek to, for the first time, understand how these tiny structures can be efficiently integrated into microprocessors and other circuitry to address the dire need for faster and more reliable on-chip wiring. The CNT interconnect structures also offer exciting prospects for design of ultra high-density energy storage elements (such as capacitors and inductors), as well as various system-level architectural innovations. <br\/><br\/>This collaborative four-year project brings together a team of scientists and engineers for addressing the key scientific and engineering challenges associated with the design and fabrication of CNT interconnect structures for various circuits and systems applications. The investigators employ an interdisciplinary approach that combines innovative process technology and circuit\/system architecture development supported by rigorous modeling, analysis, and metrology techniques. This presents an outstanding opportunity to truly demonstrate the prospects of CNTs in overcoming one of the major limitations of nanometer scale ICs, and is expected to have wide implications for the semiconductor industry. This research will help scaling of CMOS circuits to its ultimate limits and also open new opportunities in mixed-signal, analog and radio-frequency (RF) signal processing applications as well as in 3-dimensional integrated circuit design, thereby maintaining U.S. competitiveness in the worldwide semiconductor market. Broader impact of the research includes emerging off-chip applications of carbon nanotubes as ?solder bumps? and also as an excellent thermal interface material for heat removal from chips and printed circuit boards. The overall program also ties research to education at all levels (K-12, undergraduate, graduate, continuing-education) partly via participation in programs designed by education professionals, besides focusing on recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in nanoscience and engineering.","title":"CPA-DA-T: A Collaborative Framework for Design and Fabrication of Metallic Carbon Nanotube based Interconnect Structures for VLSI Circuits and Systems Applications","awardID":"0811880","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2013-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["508555","527086",370996],"PO":["562984"]},"141350":{"abstract":"This project, acquiring a high performance computing cluster, provides a computing platform with substantial computational capability to faculty and students to investigate several computationally complex problems.

Power restrictions imposed by the so-called power envelope, further aggravated by the battery life in embedded systems, compel designers to trade performance for reduced power. Furthermore, hackers, unable to break the cryptosystems using theoretical methods, have turned to secret-revealing physical properties of these systems, such as varying power consumption, to deduce secret information; these attacks are known as power side-channel attacks. The objective of this proposal is to overcome these two closely related challenges resulting from high levels of power consumption and from high degrees of variations in power levels that reveal secret information. The proposal's uniform approach to solve various facets of these problems is the exploitation of the subthreshold-voltage technology. This technique is an extreme case of voltage scaling so that the operating voltage is below the ?threshold? that turns the transistors on. This proposal plans to advance the state of secure and low-power embedded system design through innovations in subthreshold-voltage microarchitectural techniques focusing on two specific research thrusts: 1) designing a multi-core architecture with subthreshold voltage cores, which is expected to deliver the same performance as a regular design while consuming 90% less power, and 2) partitioning a secure design into security-critical and non-critical regions so that the former runs at subthreshold voltage and the latter in superthreshold, thus maximizing the performance and minimizing the risk of side-channel attacks. <br\/><br\/><br\/>This proposal aims to facilitate the use of subthreshold-based hardware design for embedded system designers by developing CAD tools, architectural techniques, and performance\/power profiling-based case studies. This, in turn, will result in increased use of this technology, enabling the achievement of new low-power milestones hitherto impossible because of the barriers imposed by traditional technologies. Some of the foreseeable application areas that could be significantly improved by advancing the targeted thrusts include electronic passports, wireless security cameras, rescue and recovery robots, and handheld landmine detectors. As part of the educational aspect of this proposal, a hands-on pre-college program, called ?Embedded for Life,? will be established in order to present the creative and beneficial aspects of the computer engineering discipline. It will showcase the use of embedded microprocessors in bettering our lives. This program, which will be developed and publicized in collaboration with IEEE, SWE, and NSBE, will encourage participation of women and minorities in computer engineering on a local and national level.","title":"CAREER: Overcoming Power Challenges in Embedded System Design With Subthreshold-Voltage Technology","awardID":"0747262","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2013-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["518481"],"PO":["562984"]},"145574":{"abstract":"Title: The Design of VoIP Systems with High Perceptual Conversational Quality <br\/>PI: Benjamin W. Wah<br\/><br\/>Abstract<br\/>This research is on the design of real-time two-party and multi-party VoIP (voice-over-IP) systems that can achieve high quality when the interactive conversation is perceived by human listeners. It focuses on the fundamental understanding of conversational quality and its trade-offs in strategies for scheduling the playback of speech frames received, concealing frames lost in the network, routing packets that carry speech frames using an overlay network, and admitting new connections in multi-party conversations. The perceptual quality of a conversation over a network connection depends on the one-way listening-only speech quality and the mouth-to-ear delay incurred from the mouth of a speaker to the ear of a listener. When there are network delays, a conversation perceived by a listener consists of speech segments that are separated by alternating short and long silence periods. This asymmetry leads to low perceptual quality in multi-party VoIP because some speakers appear to be more distant than others, whereas some respond slower than others. In this research, we develop a statistical method to collect subjective test results and a classification method to automatically learn and generalize the results to unseen network and conversational conditions. We study network-control and scheduling algorithms for improving the asymmetry in silence periods and the quality of speech segments received.","title":"The Design of VoIP Systems with High Perceptual Conversational Quality","awardID":"0841336","effectiveDate":"2008-08-15","expirationDate":"2009-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":[388382],"PO":["564777"]},"143275":{"abstract":"Toward a Linear Time Sparse Solver with Locality-Enhanced Scalable Parallelism<br\/>Padma Raghavan <br\/>Many computational science simulations concern the numeric solution of partial differential equations using implicit or semi-implicit methods.

Many of these cases involve the gradual onset of disability that offers hope for assistive technology. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in particular, is a progressive muscular disease that slowly erodes a person's ability to produce motor movements, ultimately leaving its victims in a locked-in state where they are completely paralyzed with no ability to communicate. Direct brain interfaces (DBIs) are an emerging technology based on measurement of neural activation that have the potential to provide sufferers of such severe motor disability with an alternative means of communicating with the rest of the world. But to date the best performance for a DBI communication system is about 68 bits per minute (just over 8 characters per minute), which pales in comparison to the transmission rates attained by speakers and signers (175-200 words per minute). Building on the results of previous research that suggests imagined movements produce neural activations similar to executed movements (although of lesser magnitude), the PIs hypothesize that DBI communication rates could be increased by recognizing phrases of American Sign Language (ASL) from the motor cortex, and that because people who are completely locked-in are still capable of imaging motor movements although their body is unable to physically execute the movements, a DBI that recognized imagined motor movements could potentially be fully accessible by locked-in subjects.<br\/><br\/>The PIs envisage a DBI system they have called BrainSign, that would be phased in as an alternative communication device for patients diagnosed in the early stages of a progressive muscular disease such as ALS. Upon initial diagnosis patients would learn to execute useful signs and sign phrases; at this early stage in the disease's progression, BrainSign would learn the mental activity the patient displays while executing each sign. As the disease progresses and the patient loses mobility, BrainSign would adjust to recognize the mental activity for motor imagery rather than actual motor movement, so that eventually when the patient is completely locked-in BrainSign would recognize the imagined sign and display the appropriate English translation, providing an efficient method for communicating with caregivers, friends, and family. Whether this scenario can actually be achieved is unclear, hence this exploratory project whose objectives are to characterize the extent to which individual ASL gestures of varying complexity can be discriminated by means of fMRI, and then to apply this knowledge to create the first prototype portable system that recognizes ASL from brain signals.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This work will lay the foundations for DBIs that provide much higher information transmission rates than has heretofore been achievable. Such systems will ultimately be able to assist not only locked-in people, but also many others who work in mobility-restricted environments (e.g., underwater research) and in situations where vocal communication is not possible. The research will furthermore contribute to the field of cognitive neuroscience, by providing the first comprehensive study of spatially co-located, cognitively orthogonal motor tasks. The PIs will make their data and results available via a public database, so that others can improve on the results using their algorithms.","title":"BrainSign: Recognizing American Sign Language from Brain Signals","awardID":"0836747","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2009-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["517810","554219"],"PO":["565227"]},"134475":{"abstract":"Modern scientific applications, such as analyzing information from large-scale distributed sensors, climate monitoring, and forecasting environmental impacts, require powerful computing resources and entail managing an ever-growing amount of data.

They have been applied successfully to a number of fields, such as scheduling of air traffic, software engineering, and networks security. Despite the proved usefulness of these techniques, they are under-utilized in real-life projects, mainly due to the lack of knowledge of researchers and practitioners from other fields about constraints in general and their use in decision making in particular.<br\/>Constraint solving and optimization are my primary research areas. I have been on the program committees of several related international conferences. At the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), I am leading a research group on constraints; we have been successfully collaborating with researchers from UTEP and from other schools in the US and abroad. In order to build upon our success, I am organizing a workshop at UTEP that will be focused on constraint programming and decision making. The objectives of the workshop are: 1) to draw together a network of researchers interested in constraint techniques, in particular researchers and practitioners that use numeric and symbolic approaches (or a combination) to solve constraints and optimization problems, and 2) to address the gap between the great capacity of these techniques and their limited use.<br\/>Intellectual Merit. An expected outcome of the workshop is the definition of new directions for combining numeric and symbolic approaches in solving constraints and optimization problems in particular and in decision making in general. Such a workshop is much needed as there is little connection between actual practitioners and researchers in constraints and decision making, and also because it will be a unique opportunity to gather together preeminent researchers mainly focused on combining symbolic and numeric solving and decision methods. CoProD'08 has the potential to impact these communities by easing collaborations and therefore the emergence of new techniques, and by creating a network of interest.<br\/>Broader Impact. CoProD'08 is scheduled back-to-back with a large bi-annual international conference, SCAN?2008, on Scientific Computing, Computer Arithmetic and Verified Numerical Computations (El Paso, 09\/29-10\/03\/2008). As one of the main organizers of this conference, I have been actively encouraging the participation of the constraint community in this meeting. Out of 8 invited plenary talks, two talks will be given by leaders of the constraint community and we expect several dozens of constraint-related participants from all over the world at this meeting. This conference provides us with a unique opportunity to organize a workshop on constraints because many preeminent researchers from over the world will be present.<br\/>CoProD'08 aims at impacting a broader range of people as a network of interest will be created and a webpage for this network will relay and advertise information about the members' research activities and collaborations.<br\/>Moreover, local students will be involved in the organization of the workshop and will be given the opportunity to exhibit posters about their constraint-related work outside of the workshop room, and so will the students of the other attendees.<br\/>The requested budget for this event is a total of $5,941.","title":"Constraint Programming and Decision Making Workshop, CoProD'08","awardID":"0839052","effectiveDate":"2008-08-15","expirationDate":"2010-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7933","name":"NUM, SYMBOL, & ALGEBRA COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":["432421"],"PO":["565157"]},"136598":{"abstract":"This project examines creativity in a series of activities involving the use of IT in a freshmen engineering course sequence spread across two semesters.

The fundamental idea behind this study is to understand how students engage in creativity within the constraints of engineering design activities (EDA). EDAs are bound by design guidelines and limitations of space, time, material resources, and use of specific technologies, forcing students to be inventive and creative in accomplishing their goals, whether with artifacts or with people. The study will consider how students ?make do? and what role does technology play, and how creative practices develop over time. The project uses a longitudinal study comprising of an ethnographic field study component and laboratory based studies of interaction, spread over 18 months. Rather than relying solely on pre-designed instruments that measure creativity, the project assesses creativity contextually to try and understand the full spectrum of creative practices. In addition to serving as data, the video records collected during the study will also serve as the basis for building a digital video case library to teach creativity to undergraduate and graduate students.","title":"Examining Creativity with IT in Engineering Design (X-CITED)","awardID":"0757540","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2011-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7788","name":"CreativeIT"}}],"PIcoPI":["497903","563439","564921"],"PO":["562669"]},"139403":{"abstract":"Proposals: P0811140\/P0810924\/P0811021<br\/><br\/>Title: Traceability+: a Service Oriented Framework to Support Value-Added Software Traceability<br\/><br\/>PIs: Jane Hayes, Jane Huang, and Jonathan Maletic<br\/><br\/>Traceability plays an important role in the development and assurance of software systems that permeate our society. It helps to assure that an as-built system correctly implements all requirements by supporting change impact assessment, re-engineering of applications, and other critical software engineering activities. Although previous work has focused on delivering point solutions that address specific traceability issues, this research will develop a new, powerful traceability model, Traceability+, that will deliver value-added traceability services designed to support diverse stakeholders as they perform critical software engineering activities. To accomplish this, the investigators will develop a new traceability query language and associated query mechanism, identify stakeholders' traceability-related needs, develop traceability services to meet those needs, build a knowledge base of traceability tasks and related queries, and handle varied data formats. If successful, the research could transform the community?s understanding of traceability and its benefits across the software engineering lifecycle. The evaluation of the proposed framework and dissemination of results is enhanced by having industry personnel actively participate as senior staff on the project and by an already-established Center of Excellence for Software Traceability.","title":"CPA-SEL-T: Collaborative Research: Traceability+: a Service Oriented Framework to Support Value-Added Software Traceability","awardID":"0811140","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2013-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7943","name":"PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7944","name":"SOFTWARE ENG & FORMAL METHODS"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":[370522],"PO":["564388"]},"139524":{"abstract":"Abstract<br\/>PI: Kavita Bala (0811680)<br\/><br\/>The goal of realistic imaging is to produce images that faithfully represent the appearance of the real world. Assessing image fidelity is an important aspect of realistic imaging that has broad implications in both computer graphics and digital photography. Recently perceptual metrics based on computational models of human vision have been used to characterize image fidelity; but these metrics typically characterize pixel-wise image differences. When we look at images we don?t see pixels, we see objects with distinct shapes, sizes, materials, and motions. Therefore, there is a need for image fidelity metrics that characterize the appearance properties of objects. This project introduces a new standard for image fidelity called visual equivalence. Images are visually equivalent if they convey the same information about object appearance (shape, material, lighting), even if they are different pixel-by-pixel. This new standard fundamentally expands the scope of how to assess image fidelity, providing a metric that is based on higher-level properties of visual coding.<br\/><br\/>This project seeks to understand and leverage the phenomenon of visual equivalence by: a) conducting a series of psychophysical experiments that develop a foundation for visual equivalence by exploring interactions between the geometry, material and illumination properties of objects in complex scenes; b) developing visual equivalence predictors that apply to a wide range of scenes; and c) demonstrating the practical utility of the concept of visual equivalence in a range of applications including high-fidelity environment map compression and scalable rendering of complex scenes. The products of this research provide valuable new tools for addressing one of the grand challenges in computer graphics: the high performance, high fidelity image synthesis of complex scenes. Further, this new approach to image fidelity should have a significant impact beyond graphics in areas including 2d and 3d digital image acquisition, coding, compression, transmission, storage, and display.","title":"CPA -G&V: Collaborative Research: Visual Equivalence: a New Foundation for Perceptually-Based Rendering of Complex Scenes","awardID":"0811680","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2012-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["508159",370876],"PO":["532791"]},"148357":{"abstract":"This project explores a new approach to analyzing the impacts derived from Federal funding for basic computer and information science research.

To combat them, one key step is to effectively understand how the botnet members communicate with each other. Unfortunately, the trend of adopting various obfuscation schemes (e.g., encryption) in recent bots greatly impedes our understanding. The main thrust of this research is the investigation of several interrelated key techniques to overcome the above challenges and significantly enrich the understanding of botnet command and control. Specifically, this work introduces a methodology called context-aware bot execution monitoring, from the following observations: (1) implementing the bot communication protocol, a bot program contains the authoritative protocol logic it will follow to respond and the ultimate specification of the bot messages it can handle; (2) a bot typically handles different fields of the bot message under different execution contexts, (e.g., with different run-time call stacks). As such, this research will collect, characterize, and analyze traces with execution context information to discern various protocol fields as well as associated semantics in the bot message. The broader impact of this research is two-fold: (1) It will significantly enrich the understanding of the botnet threat by not only observing and inferring the network-level interactions among bots, but also exposing the botnet C&C communication protocol logic behind detailed bot interactions. (2) Results from this research will also lead to the development of education materials for undergraduate and graduate courses and for professional training sessions. Intellectual merit of the work includes a novel approach to reverse engineering the botnet C&C communications protocol.","title":"CT-ISG: Understanding Botnet Command and Control (C&C) Communication","awardID":"0855297","effectiveDate":"2008-08-28","expirationDate":"2013-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7371","name":"CYBER TRUST"}}],"PIcoPI":["434616"],"PO":["497499"]},"133860":{"abstract":"Stony Brook University is awarded a grant to develop a prototype database for comparative anatomy into a production resource to support anatomy-based phylogenetics research.

Even before one new device technology goes into mass manufacturing, scientists start working on next generation technologies. Unfortunately, the ability to control the processing environment nears its natural limits. One direct result of this diminishing process control capability is the increasing variability in component parameters. The performance of analog electronic circuits is especially susceptible to such process variations. As the control over the process diminishes, testing the manufactured parts effectively and efficiently becomes increasingly more important. The testing process becomes all the more essential to ensure product quality and eventual success of the products in the global marketplace. The conflict resulting from the push towards higher performance while the process variability is increasing indicates a dire need for new approaches for the test automation of analog circuits that will be eventually adopted by the industry. <br\/>The goal of this project is to develop hierarchical methods for process variability analysis that are geared towards test and diagnosis automation. By determining the variance of each intermediate parameter for the fault-free circuit and for many distinct faults, efficient fault-based test and diagnosis approaches can be developed. During fault injection, only a subset of the system building blocks will change. Through the hierarchical analysis approach, the changes in the circuit will prompt reprocessing of only the information that needs to be updated to ensure efficiency. While digital fault-based test and diagnosis methods have enjoyed widespread acceptance from the industry, there has been a resistance in the analog domain mostly due to the discrepancy between the design goals and the definition of what constitutes a fault. With the help of efficient process variability analysis, this project aims at breaking through this barrier by disassociating the fault injection from the pass\/fail criteria. Aligning the pass\/fail criteria with the specifications of the circuit will initiate a wider acceptance of automated fault-based test and diagnosis in the analog domain.","title":"CAREER: Hierarchical Process Variability Analysis of Analog Circuits Geared for Test and Diagnosis","awardID":"0917766","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2013-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4710","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["525702"],"PO":["562984"]},"143243":{"abstract":"Power is now widely recognized as a first class architectural design constraint at all levels of computing, from the level of processor chips to the level of data centers. There are at least three distinct common goals for power management: energy conservation, temperature management, and limiting maximum power. The most commonly used power management technique is speed scaling, which involves changing the speed of the processor. Essentially all currently produced general purpose processors may be run at multiple speeds, and all leading processor manufacturers produce associated software that manages power by scaling processor speed. However, speed scaling as a power management technique, has to date mostly been applied in a reactive fashion in that it is usually only invoked in response to abnormal conditions, and its application is largely decoupled from the scheduling policies in that they are working independently of each other. It is widely accepted that integrated proactive power management and scheduling policies will result in better power management than simple reactive strategies.<br\/><br\/>The proposed research investigates algorithmic problems related to integrated power management and and scheduling. The resulting optimization problems have dual objectives, since one seeks to optimize both some quality-of-service measure of the schedule, and some power related criteria. In general these objectives are conflicting in that the more power that one uses, the better quality of service that can be provided. The algorithmic solutions to these problem then involve increasing power when the improvement in the scheduling objective justifies the increased cost in the power management objective. The goals of the research are threefold. The first goal is to develop algorithms that could form the basis for future power management software. The second goal is to build a toolkit of widely applicable algorithmic methods for power management problems. The third goal is help increase the computing community's ability to abstractly reason about power, energy and temperature.","title":"Algorithmic Support for Power Management","awardID":"0830558","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2012-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["534213"],"PO":["565251"]},"144343":{"abstract":"CNS ? 0836555<br\/>Clark<br\/><br\/>This award describes a set of tasks that fit within the larger context of the FIND portion of the CISE NetSE program.. FIND considers the question of what a future global network of 10 or 15 years should be, and what research is required to build it. A number of factors will differentiate the research funded in this networking focus area from more traditional NSF-supported research, including the need to bring a number of separately funded research teams together over the course of their projects, with the goal of convergence toward a small number of coherent proposals for network architecture. This special goal signals that some tasks will have to be undertaken that would not normally be proposed or funded in the context of the traditional solicitation process. This proposal is intended to work with NSF in achieving its overall goals for this project by addressing some of these special needs.<br\/><br\/>The tasks deal with the following issues: architecture framing and groundwork, working meetings and other tools for community building, outreach, ongoing program planning, identification of research priorities (and possible missing areas of investigation), and integration of non-NSF funded parties into the coordination process.

This work can lead to a more coherent articulation of long-range requirements for a future network, and a growing understanding in the community of the relationship between requirements and mechanism. This work can lead to a substantive shift in focus of specific sub-fields, such as security. It can lead to new understanding of Internet design alternatives.

First, it will be measured by the success of the FIND project in the world at large. The goal of FIND is to offer to the world a better Internet: more secure, more predictable, and more relevant to tomorrow?s needs. This initiative, if successful, will have a highly visible impact of major proportions. The goal of this proposal, in particular, is to nurture the process of turning research contributions from individuals and small teams into a larger, organized assault on the high-level goal.

The work involves investigating the relationship between the capabilities of individual units and the collective capabilities of the entire robotic team. The major innovation lies in the creation of a flexible design spectrum for both research and education based on the capabilities of the individual units. On the lower end of the spectrum, the basic design \"Explorer,\" a robot based on a Gumstix unit and earlier robot designs from one of the institutions, provides an inexpensive and yet significantly powerful solution. On the higher end, the platform \"MicroVision,\" a robot based on the Intel Pentium M processor and RoboAudioStix board, provides real-time video streaming and processing using standard off-the-shelf hardware and open-source video algorithms. The modularity of both designs allows the addition of special hardware capabilities. The infrastructure aims at low-cost, easy-to-use platforms that support research and can be adopted into courses. Specifically, this development enables design of robotics sensor-network systems that can<br\/>. Communicate reliably and efficiently via multi-hop in the presence of frequent network topology changes;<br\/>. Identify relative positions among members of a robotic team promptly and accurately for effective coordination;<br\/>. Enable energy-efficient marsupial maneuvering;<br\/>. Provide collaborative sensing with spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal coverage guarantees; and<br\/>. Interact with environments through grasping and manipulation.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This infrastructure will be used for senior theses and K-12 students will be engaged via school visits and science field days. An annual Robot Camp will be held. The activities will be helped by the National Center for Engineering and Technology Education (NCETE).

The last decade has seen astonishing advances in our methods to build object detectors. However, images convey richer information about the objects depicted in them: objects may form a scene (\"A view of mountains and meadows\"); objects are in relations with one another (\"The cat sits on the mat\"); different instances may look different (\"The tabby cat sits on the blue mat\"); objects may acting on others (\"The cat is chasing the mouse\"). This task of identifying the entities depicted in images, their attributes and relations is image understanding. This poses a number of new research questions: What objects should one remark on? What attributes of and relations between the objects depicted the image are important? That is, what is the visually salient information conveyed in an image?<br\/><br\/>Many images (e.g. a large fraction of those on the web) are accompanied by text which describes or gives additional information about the entities depicted in them. The entities referred to in this text are typically visually salient ones. This correspondence between the information conveyed in the text and the image can be used in the creation of image understanding systems. Much current work treats image annotations that consist of individual words. The richer representations of meaning required to train image understanding systems can be obtained if annotating text is treated as sentences (rather than just bags of words). Sentences provide cues to: what is salient in an image; what salient objects likely look like (e.g. color, texture and form); and what relations might appear between them. Exposing this information will provide a rich body of training data for the next generation of computer vision systems.<br\/><br\/>Research in natural language processing has created statistical wide- coverage parsers that can recover the semantic interpretation of sentences. These parsers differ from purely syntactic parsers in that they are based on linguistically expressive grammars that allow such interpretations to be built directly from the syntactic analysis. However, linking sentences with accompanying images requires a level of representation that goes beyond lists of the entities, states and events mentioned in a sentence. The writer of an image caption will typically assume that the reader sees the image, and can therefore refer to the entities depicted in it as known to the reader. There is a need parsers that are able to uncover the information structure of sentences -- what information is assumed to be shared knowledge between speaker and hearer, and what is new information asserted by the sentence. How information structure is encoded in natural language is well understood, and can be modeled with the same kinds of grammars that are used by those parsers that return semantic interpretations. Although there are currently no large corpora annotated with information structure, we will exploit the correspondence between images and their captions to develop novel, partially supervised, training regimes for parsers. These training regimes could also enable the bootstrapping of parsers for languages with no or little annotated training data.<br\/><br\/>This project will build a novel parser that recovers richer linguistic representations, including information structure. It will build a novel image understanding system that recovers the salient entities depicted in an image together with their attributes and relations. The project will train these systems both separately on datasets consisting of sentences marked up with correct parses and images marked up with labels attached to objects, and jointly on a dataset of captioned images.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual merits: The project goals are ambitious, but within reach, because both object recognition and parsing technology has advanced significantly. The project presents the vision and parsing communities with new goals, which are practically important and technically demanding. The aim of integrating natural language processing and computer vision creates a novel impetus to develop parsers that return richer linguistic representations, which will in turn have a deep impact on research within the natural language processing community itself. It will open up key directions in computer vision and natural language processing by demanding and enabling the recovery of richer representations of linguistic and visual information, and by studying how linguistic descriptions are grounded in the visual world.<br\/><br\/>Broader impact: The project has significant practical implications in a number of areas such as image search, natural language interfaces for robotics, and will ultimately pave the way for new applications such as automatic captioning systems. The resulting advances in object recognition offer possibilities for the creation of safer autonomous vehicles, safer homes for better home care, and efficie","title":"INT2-Medium: Understanding the meaning of images","awardID":"0803603","effectiveDate":"2008-08-15","expirationDate":"2012-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["457204","511678"],"PO":["564316"]},"139514":{"abstract":"There are many problems whose solutions take the form of patterns that may be expressed using grammars (e.g., speech recognition, text processing, genetic sequencing, programming language development, etc.). Construction of these grammars is usually carried out by computer scientists working with domain experts. Grammar inference (GI) is the process of learning a grammar from examples, either positive (i.e., the pattern should be recognized by the grammar) and\/or negative (i.e., the pattern should not be recognized by the grammar). This research makes a fundamental contribution toward software engineering and grammar inference technology by: 1) advancing GI algorithms which may also have new applications in other areas of computer science (e.g., bioinformatics), 2) facilitating development of domain-specific languages (DSL's) for domain experts, thus increasing productivity and reliability, and 3) providing tools for recovering software model descriptions (metamodels) from models which have evolved independently of the metamodel.<br\/><br\/> Memetic programming (MP) will be researched for recovering DSL's from example programs. MP extends genetic programming with local search and provides more effective solutions to many NP-hard problems. A local search technique based on incremental learning of context-free grammars (CFG's) will be developed along with memetic algorithms for CFG induction, in order to allow inference of DSL's. To perform metamodel inference, this research will: 1) improve abstraction hierarchy inference algorithms for metamodels, 2) recover the type information of metamodel entities, using program transformation, and 3) infer the modularization of large multi-tiered metamodels. These advancements are expected to allow inference of detailed, accurate and large scale metamodels.","title":"Grammar Inference Technology Applications in Software Engineering","awardID":"0811630","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2012-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7945","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYST"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":["403811","440747","440745"],"PO":["564388"]},"139998":{"abstract":"The gold standard against which chemical sensors are compared is the dog?s nose.

It is the primary survival mechanism with which nature endowed human physiology, and in this sense it is the prerequisite of everything else human. Stress is always present as a tonic component to sustain autonomic functions. What is of singular interest is the phasic component of stress, which represents responses to instantaneous or persistent external challenges. It is assumed that patterns of phasic stress responses deeply affect a person's performance and quality of life. However, such patterns have been inadequately quantified and studied up to now. In this project, the PI will explore a novel methodological framework for measuring and understanding the evolution of stress patterns in humans, and for determining their importance in phenotypes and performance. Physiological stress is effected through blood flow redistribution that results in localized thermoregulatory changes; these changes can be sensed by a thermal imaging sensor and analyzed within a computational framework. The PI argues that there is no better place to monitor stress signs than the face, because it is heavily innervated with sympathetic pathways, is amenable to non-contact (passive) sensing, and is open to cross-verification with traditional observational methods from psychology. He further contends that there is no better experimental framework to perform a stress study than when humans are engaged in challenging tasks with substantial stakes, as exemplified by the paradigm of surgical training. In this project, the PI will develop a novel integrated suite of sensing and computational methods to quantify stress. He will use these tools to correlate underlying physiological sensing with overt visual observation, and also to conduct longitudinal, quantifiable monitoring of realistic behavior with zero interference.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: In the short term, the findings from the surgical training study will shed light on the role of stress in a very critical profession. In the long term, not only will the technology resulting from this research be directly applicable to diverse fields such as cyber therapy, medical training, medical imaging and cognitive research, but perhaps more importantly this work will likely deepen our understanding of human-computer interaction and create a fundamentally new interface dimension for human-centric computing.","title":"HCC-Small: Do Nintendo Surgeons Defy Stress?","awardID":"0812526","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2011-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["540798","532471","494771"],"PO":["565227"]},"139558":{"abstract":"Proposal ID: 0811834 <br\/>Title: Virtualization-Aware Architectures to Accelerate Network I\/O Processing <br\/>PI name: Bhuyan, Laxmi N. <br\/>Institution: University of California-Riverside <br\/><br\/>ABSTRACT<br\/><br\/>The current application servers consist of high-performance computing, web and e-commerce servers, proxies, database servers, and multimedia servers, all of which need high rates of network I\/O processing.

This advantage results in extended battery life and energy efficiency. However, asynchronous design (clockless design or ?handshake clocking?) has remained an exotic technology due to its incompatibility with traditional clocked CAD and design methodologies. A fundamental problem to adoption of asynchronous design methods is the inability to characterize and predict performance through static timing analysis, and use timing driven power\/performance optimization to place and route these designs. This proposal develops fundamental technology that resolves this roadblock, thus enabling asynchronous design to be integrated into clocked designs and into the clocked CAD tool flows. This opens up a broad capability for designs to operate at higher performance and become more energy efficient. This work is founded on a novel technology called relative timing which uses formal verification techniques to prove both timing and behavioral correctness of asynchronous templates. Timing is now represented as logical constraints. These logical constraints are used to break cyclical sequential circuits into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). These designs are now directly supported in clocked designs and tool flows as .sdc constraints.<br\/><br\/><br\/>There is currently very limited expertise in this technology, so training students must primarily be provided at the university rather than on the job.

A computation\/storage hierarchy will be designed, studied with diverse components at small scale, optimized further, and finally constructed at full scale (reaching 250+ terabytes). GPU performance proves to be a ?disruptive technology? enabling the architecture to deliver I\/O at full performance, something not possible with multicore x86 systems alone. High performance, high reliability parallel I\/O will coexist with computation and be supported through pNSF, rather than being presented only as add-on SAN architecture or as limited direct attached storage. Introducing simpler controllers (JBOD plus failover) and using GPUs for offloading RAID computation and reconstruction, systemic abstraction barriers of separate controller and CPU subsystems should weaken. Since failures occur in practice at non-trivial rates in large installations, the system will be configurable for high performance with RAID configurations (e.g., three-disk-or-higher failure resiliency). The constructed large-scale system will be used to test reliability and performance. The ability to move computation closer to storage drives the experimental architecture that will support scalable scientific algorithms as well as modern Internet application back-ends. If successful, the architecture of the clusters and grid nodes might shift from x86-64 servers plus local RAID or SAN storage to this heterogeneous architecture while conserving programming paradigms (e.g., MPI-2 + Pthreads). Muticore x86-64 CPUs alone might be insufficient for achieving high availability, high performance storage and computation based on current and near-term COTS components. Furthermore, silicon optimizations that may converge GPUs with CPUs might not significantly diminish the long-term value of the proposed cluster architecture and associated systems integration work.","title":"MRI: Development of a GPU-Enabled Integrated Storage Computation Architecture and System","awardID":"0821497","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2012-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1189","name":"MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":["527384","522113"],"PO":["557609"]},"143673":{"abstract":"Balancing environmental, economic, and societal needs for a sustainable future encompasses problems of unprecedented size and complexity. With naturally occuring settings, global scale, dynamic and uncertain behavior, mixture of discrete and continuous effects, and highly interactive components, problems associated with sustaining the earth's resources can greatly benefit from computational methods and thinking. There is a key role to be played by computing and information sciences in increasing the efficiency and effectiveness in the way humanity manages and allocates natural resources. Toward that objective, this Expedition aims to establish and nurture a new field of study--Computational Sustainability--driven by a wide range of hard computational problems and critical challenges in the area of sustainability. This applied theoretical Expedition will pursue interdisciplinary research across three computational sustainability themes: conservation and biodiversity; balancing socio-economic demands and the environment; and renewable energy. With the view that natural problems may have a special structure discoverable by machine learning techniques that allows them to be solved even though they are NP-hard, this research attempts to stimulating new research synergies that cross boundaries and merge ideas from combinatorial optimization, dynamical systems, machine learning and constraint reasoning. An \"Institute for Computational Sustainability\" will be based at Cornell to serve as the nexus of foundational science advancements and practical applications in sustainability.

This is important since today's encrypted information should remain secure even after quantum computers have been built. This project will address these two issues. The first part will focus on finding new problems that have exponentially faster algorithms on quantum computers than on classical computers. Problems where a potential exponential speedup exists include graph isomorphism, the unique shortest lattice vector problem, and the nonabelian hidden subgroup problem. The second part of this project will study which classical cryptosystems remain secure in the presence of quantum computers. This requires understanding the limitations of quantum computers. Modern cryptography relies on assuming that certain problems cannot be solved on classical computers, and this set must also be identified for quantum computers.

The economics literature provides nice characterizations of optimal mechanisms in simple enough settings, that can then inform the design of real mechanisms. Unfortunately, in many other settings impossibility results show that there is no simple description of an optimal mechanism. The PIs' research advocates using algorithmic approaches to identify simple and natural descriptions of approximately optimal mechanisms; it addresses economic settings that are both challenge problems in economics and relevant to the design of computer systems. A primary focus of this research is the biggest open problem in mechanism design: domains where each user's preference is given by multiple parameters. Especially interesting special cases that the PIs plan to study include the role of randomization in the mechanism and user preferences with budgets. Another area of focus deals with the design and analysis of non-truthful mechanisms. The computer science literature on mechanism design almost exclusively restricts attention to the design of mechanisms where \"truthful bidding\" is an optimal strategy for each user. Most mechanisms used in practice are not truthful. However CS literature lacks techniques for going from truthful mechanisms to natural, practical (probably non-truthful) mechanisms, or a theory of designing natural non-truthful mechanisms in the first place. Where the natural, practical mechanism is not optimal, theory for quantifying its approximation factor, a.k.a., \"price of anarchy\", is of interest.

New subspace-based estimation algorithms will be developed that employ the FRFT framework to obtain high-resolution chirp-rate and center-frequency estimates that are statistically consistent and asymptotically optimal; these estimates translate, in turn, into estimates of the instantaneous velocity of the vibrating objects that are illuminated by a SAR imaging system.

This proposal focuses on identification of nematodes, which are particularly difficult to identify, with the average identification requiring significant time and high level of expertise. Nematodes have direct and significant effect on humans, other animals, and agriculture. Four species of nematode parasites infect over 2 billion people worldwide, and one type of nematode causes one-third of the total estimated worldwide annual yield losses to all soybean pathogens. The current limiting factors for identification are the lack of tools and automation, the need for image comparison off-line and a need for significant expertise. To enable seasoned researchers as well as students to use resources, the team will build on image searching work, using a set of images that will make nematode identification a simple process of point and click. In addition to enabling research by harnessing data and experience of experts, the work may make biology more accessible. The team will build a computer-assisted interactive navigator that will intelligently assist and learn from the user. The work can be extended to many other biological data sets. The research challenges include extraction of features and similarity functions, and the mining, clustering, and anomaly detection for image and non-image data.

While these two sources interact in complex ways in the acoustic domain, a few studies indicate that they may be decoupled in the articulatory space, specifically in the vocal tract frontal cavity.<br\/><br\/>The objective of this research is to determine the extent to which foreign-accent conversion can be performed through articulatory inversion of the frontal cavity. For this purpose, two complementary problems are being investigated. First, existing articulatory datasets are being used to develop a foreign-accent conversion model that operates in the frontal cavity domain. Second, articulatory inversion models are being developed to estimate the frontal cavity configuration from speech acoustics.

Similarly, human-computer interaction (HCI) methods, despite considerable research efforts, remain dominated by the traditional keyboard and mouse. Improving HCI is a critical area of need, especially for individuals with disabilities who find traditional methods cumbersome (at best) or unusable (at worst). The rapid development of radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies holds the potential to significantly advance current challenges in both gesture recognition and HCI. Advantages of RFID approaches include miniaturization of passive tags, the ability to safely implant tags, and the potential to remotely track multiple tags; these characteristics combine to support the definition, recognition, and development of interfaces based on (tagged) human movements, or gestures. The PI's goal in this project is to explore RFID solutions for the most challenging gesture recognition and HCI applications, including complex gesture recognition and effective computer interfaces for individuals with severe motor impairments. These objectives will be realized through a series of coordinated research, development, and evaluation efforts. First, RFID localization algorithms will be developed utilizing harmonic radar approaches and implemented using modified commercially available components; this approach will yield significantly higher resolution than current power loss techniques, and will be capable of tracking multiple tags in cost-effective implementations. Next, implementations for small and large workspace will be carried out. The small workspace implementation will address tongue-based HCI for individuals with severe disabilities, while the large workspace implementation will be used for hand gesture recognition and computer control. Finally, the algorithms, hardware, and implementations will be rigorously evaluated for fundamental accuracy, application performance, and user efficacy. Fundamental accuracy evaluations will characterize the performance and limits of spatial-temporal RFID tag tracking, while HCI and gesture recognition capabilities will be assessed through application performance and user efficacy evaluations. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This research addresses fundamentally important interface and communications issues faced by individuals with disabilities, and will include direct programmatic involvement by individuals with disabilities. Project outcomes will afford individuals with disabilities more effective interfaces and greater communications capabilities, thereby providing greater independence and, ultimately, improved social, educational, and economic opportunities. In achieving these objectives, the project will lay the foundation for a fundamentally new approach to capturing, characterizing, and exploiting human movement for HCI and gesture recognition applications. The results will have significant impact beyond the targeted applications, for instance in animal studies, human performance studies, and even security (e.g., monitoring fine movements of objects).","title":"HCC-SMALL: High-Resolution RFID Tracking With Applications In Gesture Recognition And Human-Computer Interaction","awardID":"0812458","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2012-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["517187","550478",371218],"PO":["565227"]},"139438":{"abstract":"The goal of the BlueChip project is to develop security defenses against malicious hardware.

One may address these problems, in principle, by tightly controlling each step and handoff in the path from design to realization (sometimes called the \"supply chain''). A superior solution is to presume that attackers will overcome these technical and procedural hurdles, and to build defenses.

This research develops and evaluates a location-aware non-mimetic simulation game for teaching team coordination based on preliminary findings that establish the importance of dynamic re-grouping of participants and optimization of communication modalities, such as face-to-face and radio, in fire emergency response. The project introduces non-mimetic simulation to describe environments that model contextualized human task operations, emphasizing the structure of human communication and coordination, while abstracting out physical characteristics of an environment. Non-mimetic simulation focuses simulation resources on goal-directed operational characteristics of task performance, such as information flows. The objective of this proposal is to develop new high performance, cost-effective methods for using location-aware non-mimetic simulation games to teach team coordination for emergency response. Further, the transfer of the non-mimetic simulation from its roots in grounded ethnographic data about fire emergency response to teaching teams of STEM students to coordinate collaborative projects will be investigated. The principal hypotheses are to investigate whether and how location-aware games can improve team coordination performance in dangerous and stressful environments, and whether this method for teaching skills will prove transferable to other teamwork contexts.<br\/><br\/>The proposed research is innovative in its interdisciplinary approach, which integrates methods from ethnography, distributed and team cognition, game design, location-aware systems, human computer interaction, and emergency response. This innovative approach is expected to yield significant outcomes: (1) a grounded methodology of non-mimetic simulation; (2) new knowledge of how embodied game play impacts education; (3) new non-mimetic simulation game design methods for teaching team coordination across domains; (4) new knowledge about designing and evaluating location-aware systems; (5) new methods for evaluating team coordination and how games support it. Research products will be deployed in the nation's largest fire training facility, which educates over 45,000 students per year, improving the skills and performance of emergency responders. More effective teamwork means that fire emergency responders will be better able to perform their duties: protecting the lives of citizens, protecting each others' lives, and protecting property. Games are an essential form of culture. Delivering education through games will motivate student engagement. In a period in which STEM enrollment has been declining, deployment among undergraduate computer science majors is expected to increase retention.","title":"HCC - Medium: A Location-Aware Non-Mimetic Simulation Game for Teaching Team Coordination","awardID":"0803854","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2013-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["531380"],"PO":["564456"]},"145467":{"abstract":"Proposal ID: 0840936 <br\/>PI Name: Michael S.

This is a high-risk, high pay-off investigation on an approach that has not been done in the past. Individual knowledge acquired during the search is extracted to benefit collective effort. This is enabled via cultivation of knowledge exchange, accumulation, and utilization. The intelligent partitioning and grouping of the state variables allows for the construction of many effective abstract navigation tracks in large designs. This is a key breakthrough as the mined tracks naturally provide multiple valuable abstractions of the design upon which collective and diverse effort can be conducted. The development of new theories and algorithms will be an original contribution that will allow for transformative understanding of semi-formal verification and state space exploration, all in a rigorous framework.<br\/><br\/>The theories and practice that will result from this work will not only enable us for a deeper understanding of collective effort, it will shed light on other intractable problems as well, from closely related research areas such as manufacturing test to artificial intelligence.<br\/><br\/>This project will directly promote the education of the involved students.

As an extreme example, if it turns out that P=NP or that one-way functions do not exist, all of public-key cryptography and many tools crucial for national and personal security would be permanently incapacitated. In this (unlikely but possible) event, much of the computer infrastructure would have to be redesigned on a less impressive scale. On the other hand, many great advances cannot be foreseen even now due to insufficient theoretical understanding of basic issues.<br\/><br\/>Computations rarely run in deterministic isolation. They interact with users and adversaries, with random events called by algorithms or generated by the context, with delays and glitches from the system, hardware, and distributed infrastructure, etc. Some of these interactions are hard to model, but even those with straightforward mathematical models are often very hard to analyze. Randomness and non-determinism are two basic \"freedoms\" branching out of the concept of deterministic computation which play a crucial role in computing theory. Yet our understanding of their role and power is minimal. Even a gradual progress in understanding these phenomena and their relationship to each other and to other concepts would be important.<br\/><br\/>An example of achievements in this direction is the discovery of generic relationship between one-way functions and deterministic generation of randomness. Another is the concept of transparent (also called holographic, or PCP) proofs and computations. A number of interesting techniques useful for quite different results in these areas have been accumulated: low-degree polynomials and Fourier transforms over low-periodic groups, related to classical results on error-correcting codes and hashing, expander graphs, hierarchic structures, etc. The PI will continue his investigation of such concepts and of the power of these and other related techniques.<br\/><br\/>Symmetry is one of the central phenomena in many fields. In computation it can simplify analysis, provide uniformity and redundancy useful, e.g., for error-correction. On the other hand, it can cause indecisiveness, deadlocks and complicate initialization and organization of computing processes. Breaking symmetries is as essential a task as maintaining them. A study of a number of mathematical and algorithmic tools useful for symmetry breaking is intended. Examples include Thue sequences, aperiodic tilings, extensions of the concept of flat connections from manifolds to graphs, and others.<br\/><br\/>The work will advance discovery and understanding via dissemination of the results through talks, papers, and Web pages, PI's own and those of others.

A central component of artistic creativity is the ability to imagine and perform new actions. The ideomotor theory in cognitive science suggests that imagination and action share a common coding in the brain. This project extends body memories using virtual environments and tangible interfaces. The premise is that augmenting creativity involves expanding the number of solutions one can generate, i.e. broadening the creative space. The project develops an environment that includes video game characters that encode our body movements through tangible user interfaces as a way to broaden the body memories of the player. The project is multidisciplinary, and has a range of possible broader impacts, scientific, technological and social. On the scientific front, the project would contribute to a better understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying imagination, motor learning and action perception. This has potential implications in areas such as conflict resolution, medical rehabilitation and educational technologies. A variety of applications are possible on the technology front, including template combos of movements that generate specific character impressions in viewers, and algorithms that isolate and accentuate movement features that humans perceive as biological. On the social front, once movement patterns become ?swappable?, it would be possible to share entire personalities online by sharing whole body movement patterns. This could lead to more refined understanding and empathy for others.","title":"PILOT: Unlocking Body Memories for Creativity: Controlling Virtual Characters with Tangible Interfaces to Augment Expression and Cognition","awardID":"0757370","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2011-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7788","name":"CreativeIT"}}],"PIcoPI":["550811","443231"],"PO":["564456"]},"138889":{"abstract":"Scalable Parallel Algorithms for Partial Differential Equations<br\/>Abstract<br\/>Scalable algorithms for partial differential equations play a key role in Computational Science and Engineering. As the number of processors in today's supercomputers grows rapidly, scalability becomes one of the most important issues in algorithm design. Tremendous progress has been made in this research area in the past few years. The conference brings together experts in this field from all over the world to discuss the latest development of scalable algorithms, and to introduce junior researchers to this exciting research field. The conference also supports the participation of graduate students and provides them with a unique opportunity for exposing their research to a large audience and for learning from experts.<br\/>The primary focus is on domain decomposition METHODS which COMPRISE by far the most common scalable paradigm for large-scale simulation on massively parallel distributed, hierarchical memory computers. In domain decomposition, a large problem is reduced to a collection of smaller problems, each of which is easier to solve computationally than the un-decomposed problem, and most or all of which can be solved independently and concurrently. Typically, it is necessary to iterate over the collection of smaller problems, and much of the theoretical interest in domain decomposition algorithms lies in ensuring that the number of iterations required is very small. Indeed, the best domain decomposition methods share with their cousins, multigrid methods, the property that the total computational work is linearly proportional to the size of the input data, or that the number of iterations required is at most logarithmic in the number of degrees of freedom of individual subdomains. Algorithms whose work requirements are linear in the size of the input data in this context are said to be optimal. Optimal domain decomposition algorithms are now known for many, but certainly not all, important classes of problems that arise in science and engineering. Much of the current research interest in domain decomposition algorithms lies in extending the classes of problems for which optimal algorithms are known. Domain decomposition algorithms can be tailored to the properties of the physical system as reflected in the mathematical operators, the number of processors available, and even to specific architectural parameters, such as cache size and the ratio of memory bandwidth to floating point processing rate.","title":"Scalable Parallel Algorithms for Partial Differential Equations","awardID":"0809007","effectiveDate":"2008-08-15","expirationDate":"2010-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":["549376",369299,"485287","517075"],"PO":["562984"]},"139527":{"abstract":"Multi-million line systems are being developed in Java for avionics, shipboard computing and simulation. A key attraction of the Real-Time Speci&#64257;cation for Java for such systems is that it makes it possible to develop applications that mix hard-, soft-, and non-real-time tasks in the same environment in a memory-safe way. Unfortunately these advantages come at the expense of predictability of the real-time subsystems. One of the main culprits for such unpredictability in Java is garbage collection, which often requires applications to be interrupted for hundreds of milliseconds. Such pauses are not acceptable in real-time systems. One way to address this critical problem is to develop real-time garbage collectors (RTGC) with worst-case bounds on pause times and minimum mutator utilization. RTGC research is still in its infancy. There are limits to the applicability of current algorithms in terms of the strength of the timing guarantees that they offer. Furthermore, one serious limitation to the use of RTGC in safety- and mission- critical settings is the issue of certi&#64257;cation of the software. In the current state of the art, no garbage collector has been formally veri&#64257;ed. Without these guarantees there is little hope of adoption.<br\/><br\/><br\/>This research comprises work on two crucial issues in real-time virtual machines for high-level languages. First, it is exploring new approaches to RTGC based on probabilistic lock-free synchronization that provide strong timing guarantees that have a vanishingly small probability of being violated. Second, it uses theorem proving to generate a provably correct garbage collection algorithm. This step is critical for certi&#64257;cation of advanced runtime environments and, as best is known, has never been attempted before. RTGC prototypes are being implemented in the context of a high-performance open source real-time Java virtual machine. This experimental platform is an industrial strength implementation of Java which is the only Java virtual machine to have been &#64258;ight tested (in a collaboration with Boeing). Outcomes include empirical results for a suite of large real-time Java programs.

Nevertheless, one fundamental physical limit, power consumption, must be addressed to enable such trend. Power is no longer a desirable feature but an actual design constraint in making future many-core processor systems practical. On the other hand, emerging process technologies such as 3D die stacking enables a new dimension of integration and provides new opportunities for improving bandwidth, latency, and power. Given such design constraints and new opportunities, the current symmetric, homogeneous multi-core processors integrated in a MIMD manner will be inappropriate as a scalable solution from power- and area-efficiency standpoints despite their reduced implementation effort. In particular, for applications with inherently high data-level parallelism, it is possible to design new architectures that exploit the 3D stacking. <br\/><br\/>In this research, a new many-core architecture, called Parallel-On-Demand (POD), will be investigated to exploit the maximum performance for a given die area and energy budget. Instead of using conventional, special-purpose ASIC accelerators, POD integrates a performance acceleration layer (PAL), which is tightly coupled as a separate die layer using 3D die stacking. PAL leverages many ideas learned from massively parallel processors but focuses on modern multi-faceted challenges such as power and area efficiency, on-chip wire delay issues, on-chip interconnects, integration with out-of-order cores, backward\/forward compatibility, virtualized resource mapping, and extensibility. A 3D-integrated performance acceleration layer applied as a snap-on feature also makes the entire system flexible, reducing non-recurring engineering cost for different target markets. Moreover, new programming models will be investigated to simplify the interaction between programmers and POD, overall hardware complexity and its ensuing power implications. The success of such 3D on-die many-core architecture will provide a foundation to enable highly scalable computation with substantial energy efficiency, paving the road to Peta-FLOPS computing with minimal resources.","title":"Parallel-on-Demand --- A Broad Purpose 3D-Integrated Performance Acceleration Layer for General Purpose Processors","awardID":"0811738","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2012-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2878","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CCF"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["526309"],"PO":["366560"]},"139549":{"abstract":"Power and microarchitectural scalability concerns have motivated the recent industrial transition to multicore processors. In the near future, because of VLSI scaling limitations, processors will only be able to make use of a small fraction of the die at one time at full speed. The emergence of three-dimensional CMOS integration exacerbates this problem by substantially increasing device count without improving transistor power efficiency. This \"utilization wall\" threatens to halt the progress of Moore's law and stop the yearly improvements in processor performance that have transformed society over the last 40 years.<br\/><br\/>This research attacks the utilization wall by examining the design, construction and analysis of Arsenal processors. Arsenal processors are comprised of a heterogeneous array of 10s to 100s to even 1000s of specialized processing elements (SPEs), a small subset of which will be active at any time. The SPEs in an Arsenal system will vary from specialized ASICs to graphics accelerators and out-of-order superscalars. Different parts of a program will run on the SPEs best suited to each part. Since specialized processors are generally smaller and more efficient, each program will use just a fraction of the die, but will do so extremely efficiently. Our preliminary results show that Arsenal designs improve power efficiency by up to 7x compared to less aggressively heterogeneous approaches. <br\/><br\/>While the potential benefits of Arsenal-style processors are alluring, Arsenal systems present significant challenges as well. Designers must find a way to quickly develop a wide range of SPEs that can collectively improve efficiency for a typical end-user's workload. The memory system in an Arsenal design must deliver sufficient memory bandwidth to each SPE.Arsenal processors must include an on-chip interconnect that can support thousands of communicating SPEs. To this end, we will colloborate with the MIT ATAC project, which focuses on on-chip interconnect design, and we will incorporate their interconnect into our own work. <br\/><br\/>The proposed work will explore many architectural challenges that arise in designing massively heterogeneous Arsenal systems with potentially 1000s of specialized cores. Its goals are to demonstrate the potential of Arsenal processors, develop the tools needed to design complete Arsenal-based systems, and to build a complete, general-purpose prototype Arsenal processor.","title":"CPA-CSA-T: Arsenal: Extending Moore's Law through the Design, Synthesis and Use of Massively Heterogeneous Systems","awardID":"0811794","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2012-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["451456","557941","518615"],"PO":["366560"]},"141420":{"abstract":"Proposal #: CNS 08-21750<br\/>PI(s): Ye, Wei<br\/> Heidemann, John S.; Mitra, Urbashi<br\/>Institution: University of Southern California<br\/> Los Angeles, CA 90089-1147<br\/>Title: MRI\/Dev.: Dev. of An Always-Available Testbed for Underwater Networking Research<br\/>Project Proposed:<br\/>This project, developing an underwater networking testbed instrument (DATURN) that will be always-available and remotely accessible through Internet as a shared infrastructure for the community, aims at supporting research across the whole network stack.

A pluggable software architecture is envisioned permitting algorithms to be dropped into an existing protocol stack and reuse components that are outside the research focus. Standard APIs will be defined for different layers and at least one reference protocol; implementation will be provided at each layer, allowing, for example, a researcher with a new transport protocol to leverage routing or MAC protocols contributed by other researchers. A library of protocols will be built over time, enabling comparative study of alternatives. At present there is lack of common means to evaluate and compare protocols.

The economics literature provides nice characterizations of optimal mechanisms in simple enough settings, that can then inform the design of real mechanisms. Unfortunately, in many other settings impossibility results show that there is no simple description of an optimal mechanism. The PIs' research advocates using algorithmic approaches to identify simple and natural descriptions of approximately optimal mechanisms; it addresses economic settings that are both challenge problems in economics and relevant to the design of computer systems. A primary focus of this research is the biggest open problem in mechanism design: domains where each user's preference is given by multiple parameters. Especially interesting special cases that the PIs plan to study include the role of randomization in the mechanism and user preferences with budgets. Another area of focus deals with the design and analysis of non-truthful mechanisms. The computer science literature on mechanism design almost exclusively restricts attention to the design of mechanisms where \"truthful bidding\" is an optimal strategy for each user. Most mechanisms used in practice are not truthful. However CS literature lacks techniques for going from truthful mechanisms to natural, practical (probably non-truthful) mechanisms, or a theory of designing natural non-truthful mechanisms in the first place. Where the natural, practical mechanism is not optimal, theory for quantifying its approximation factor, a.k.a., \"price of anarchy\", is of interest.

This research contributes to this trend by developing algorithms for reconstructing 3D models from the raw data returned by today's acquisition modalities. The challenges focused on in this work are two-fold: First, to be useful in practice, the algorithms must be able to process huge datasets, often too large to be able to fit into the working memory of an application. Second, the algorithms must be designed to be versatile, capable of adapting to the varying and non-uniform data returned by the different scanners.<br\/><br\/>To address these challenges, the investigators reduce the problem of surface reconstruction to the solution of a Poisson equation which can be solved over an octree adapted to the scanned data. Specifically, this research makes three separate contributions. First, it describes a novel algorithm for solving the global Poisson system in a local manner, providing a solver that only requires a small subset of the system to be maintained in working memory at any given time. Second, it presents a novel data-structure that enables streaming traversal through an octree, making it possible to process high-resolution data that is too large to fit into memory. And third, using a finite elements formulation, it generalizes a method for model fitting that allows functions to be fit to data sampled using non-point primitives, extending the breadth of acquisition modalities supported by the reconstruction algorithm.","title":"CAREER: Reconstructing 3D Models from Today?s Scanning Devices","awardID":"0746039","effectiveDate":"2008-08-15","expirationDate":"2013-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7453","name":"GRAPHICS & VISUALIZATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}}],"PIcoPI":[357178],"PO":["532791"]},"143038":{"abstract":"0829838 - EMT\/Nano: Energy Minimization Computing using Field Coupled Nanomagnets--Modeling and Fabrication<br\/><br\/>Sudeep Sarkar, Sanjukta Bhanja<br\/><br\/>Field coupled computing is a radically different paradigm where electrical, magnetic or spin coupling among nano-devices are utilized for computation.

On the defensive side, a fundamental limitation of traditional host-based anti-malware systems is that they run inside the very hosts they are protecting, making them vulnerable to malware's counter-detection and subversion. To address this limitation, solutions using virtual machine (VM) technologies advocate placing the malware detection facility outside of the protected VM. However, a dilemma exists between these two approaches: The \"\"out of the box\"\" approach gains tamper resistance at the cost of losing the native, semantic view of the host enjoyed by the \"\"in the box\"\" approach. To resolve the above dilemma, a new approach called OBSERV (\"\"Out of the Box with SEmantically Reconstructed View\"\") is introduced to achieve the advantages of both camps by reconstructing the semantic internal view of a VM from external, low-level observations. OBSERV enables two exciting malware defense opportunities: (1) malware detection by view comparison and (2) real-time detection and stoppage of kernel-level rootkits. The broader impact of this research is two-fold: (1) It will enhance the trustworthiness and effectiveness of widely deployed anti-malware systems. Moreover, OBSERV is expected to be viewed favorably by the anti-virus software industry because of its support for existing off-the-shelf anti-virus software. (2) Results from this research will lead to the development of education materials for undergraduate and graduate courses and for professional training sessions.","title":"CT-ISG: Collaborative: Enabling Detection of Elusive Malware by by Going Out of the Box with Semantically Reconstructed View (OBSERV)","awardID":"0852131","effectiveDate":"2008-08-13","expirationDate":"2011-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7456","name":"ITR-CYBERTRUST"}}],"PIcoPI":["434616"],"PO":["561889"]},"139507":{"abstract":"Virtually every high-performance processor today has multiple processing<br\/>units (also known as cores) on a single chip.

However, as these platforms continue to evolve, they are becoming increasingly complex to design and implement for a given application. Much of the complexity associated with sensor-based platforms is due to the plethora of parameters that must be considered. To further complicate matters, application developers oftentimes are not trained engineers, but rather biologists, teachers, or agriculturists who wish to utilize the sensor-based systems within their given domain. Faced with an overwhelming number of choices, application design may be a daunting task for non-experts. This project seeks to alleviate some of the complexities associated with sensor-based system design through the use of automated optimization methods that abstract many of the underlying design and platform details, dynamic profiling methods capable of observing application-level behavior, and dynamic optimization to tune the underlying platform accordingly. Dynamic profiling enables an accurate view of the application behavior and allows the system to monitor how the application responds to changing environmental conditions or changes in the platform itself. If the developer specified performance metrics are not currently being met, dynamic optimization and network reconfiguration can adapt the deployed network to its current surroundings and application requirements. This dynamic profiling and optimization environment reduces developer effort and increases the accessibility of sensor-based systems to a wider audience, where we believe such systems can enhance everyday lives, and further the emergence of innovative applications.","title":"Collaborative Research: CSR-EHCS, SM: DPOP - A Dynamic Profiling and Optimization Platform for Sensor-Based Networks","awardID":"0834102","effectiveDate":"2008-08-15","expirationDate":"2011-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["408607","532440"],"PO":["561889"]},"141455":{"abstract":"The research and education community faces a pressing need for effective and efficient strategies for securing its IT infrastructure.

Implementation of energy-efficient and biologically motivated algorithms for cooperative motion planning and control enables the development of a reliable networked autonomous mobile robot system capable of operating in partially known, changing, and unpredictable environments. The work focuses on analysis and design of theoretically provable cooperative control laws for networked nonlinear dynamic systems. Currently, few results are available for cooperative control of truly nonlinear dynamic systems such as nonholonomic robots. Thus, this project involves the design of a robust, locally optimal hierarchical cooperative control strategy for networked nonholonomic constraints and obstacles avoidance issues. The development and implementation in software and in hardware of the algorithms addresses the following relevant fundamental issues. <br\/>- Trajectory generation for multiple mobile robots with kinematic nonholonomic constraints,<br\/>- Optimal trajectory tracking with modeling uncertainties in friction and actuator saturation, and<br\/>- Less restrictive biologically-motivated local cooperative control algorithms which enable collision avoidance among robots and with obstacles in dynamic and unpredictable environments.<br\/>Lyapunov argument and M-matrix theory are employed for rigorous proof of multi-robot system stability resulting from derived cooperative control algorithms. Experimental validations of the technical solutions are planned. These tests address realistic difficulties, such as wheel slippage, friction, actuators saturations, sensor and measurement noise, and communication delays adding knowledge of useful guidelines to the design and applications The research and expected results should have immediate applications in industry for factory automation, transportation, intelligent highway systems, large scale sensor networks for environmental sampling, and cooperative search and information acquisition in hazardous environments.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts:<br\/>This project enhances collaborative multidisciplinary research between computer engineering, computer science, and environmental science.

Many researchers have observed that naturally occurring problems tend to be complete for one of a small handful of important complexity classes. Furthermore, they are complete for these classes via the weakest imaginable reductions, namely quantifier-free projections (qfps). It was shown by the investigator and his coauthors that problems complete for the same class via qfps are isomorphic. What this means is that although there is an arbitrarily rich class of different computational problems, in practice we often encounter problems that look different, but are essentially one of a handful of fundamental complete problems. Now that SAT solvers have become so fast, this project will show that it is feasible to use them to check whether or not (small) qfps exists between all (small) instances of a given pair of computational problems. In this way, we will often be able to automatically check whether reductions exist and thus determine the complexity of a given computational problem. This research will add to our understanding of the fundamental complexity of problems. In the longer term, it will lead to improved algorithms that automatically derive efficient data structures and algorithms for given computational problems.","title":"Variables versus Size: Tradeoffs in Descriptive Complexity","awardID":"0830174","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2012-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["485266"],"PO":["565157"]},"134437":{"abstract":"CCF - 0746608 <br\/>PI name: Deming Chen<br\/>Title: CAREER: Nano-Centric Design Methodology for Nanoscale FPGAs<br\/>Institution: University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign<br\/><br\/>ABSTRACT:<br\/>Conventional top-down manufacturing faces serious challenges due to fundamental physical and economical constraints. Bottom-up approaches, in which integrated functional device structures are assembled from chemically synthesized nanoscale building blocks, such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) and nanowires, have the potential to revolutionize the fabrication of electronic systems for the future. Such nanosystems are by their nature very regular in structure and, therefore, suitable to implementation similar to Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Nanoelectronic circuits always have a certain percentage of defects as well as nanomaterial-specific variations over and above process variations introduced by lithography. Using simplified nanodevice assumptions and traditional scaled design flows will lead to suboptimal and impractical nanoFPGA designs and inaccurate system evaluation results. For nanotechnology to fulfill its promise, we need to understand and incorporate nano-specific design techniques, such as nanosystems modeling, statistical approaches and fault tolerant design, systematically from devices all the way up to systems. Motivated by this observation, this CAREER program proposes a fundamental, systematic and nano-centric design methodology for nanoscale FPGAs. The proposal includes the following four integrated design aspects: 1) Patterning: Designs novel and reliable architecture patterns, such as a new CNT-based one-time-configurable FPGA; 2) Modeling: Develops new device\/wire\/circuit models considering nanomaterial-specific variations, manufacturing limitations, and defects; 3) Synthesizing: Focuses on novel nano-centric synthesis techniques from the behavior level down to the physical design level; and 4) Evaluating: Builds a new parameterized nanoFPGA evaluation\/exploration engine NanoEngine. <br\/>The PI plans to develop a new interdisciplinary course incorporating nanomaterials fabrication, nanoelectronic principles, programmable ICs, and CAD.

A major challenge of bioinformatics over the coming years will be to develop methods for mining these interaction networks to formulate models of cellular machinery and pathways. In the present application, the multi-campus team extends the field of network integration in three fundamental directions: [a] Increases in the efficiency of pair-wise and multiple network alignment, which is a central bottleneck in network analysis; [b] Protein-network-based diagnosis of disease, through classification of expression profiles gathered for use cases and controls; and [c] Alignment of physical interaction networks with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) interactions, which are increasingly important for mapping signaling and regulatory pathways in mammals. Molecular interactions represent a relatively new and rapidly accumulating biological data type which has created enormous challenges and opportunities for Information Integration and Informatics (III). These data motivate a number of fundamental biological questions and associated tasks: how best to associate molecular interactions with functional roles; how to enrich for the true biological signal in often noisy interaction data; and, perhaps most importantly, how to organize interaction data into models of cellular signaling and regulatory machinery. A major outcome of the proposed research will be a suite of biological network analysis tools that are widely distributed for academic, research, and non-commercial purposes. These tools are aimed at changing the way biologists use and interpret molecular interaction data, and they will be key components of a next-generation bioinformatics toolbox for synthesizing and distilling large genomic and proteomic data sets into functional models of basic cellular processes and disease.

It will focus on two classes of designs: a) easy to implement, fair and efficient schemes that ensure that competing traffic is correctly throttled when congestion is detected inside the network, and b) near-optimal schemes estimate available network capacity and apportion it to flows in a fair and efficient manner.<br\/><br\/>Broad Impact. The proposed work can spur the adoption of mesh networks in a future Internet, and influence architectural choices in its design. Mesh networks are already becoming the networking technology of choice in a variety of locations including airports, hotels, convention centers, shopping malls, education facilities, and hospitals. With their increasing economic importance, this project is poised to make impact, seeking as it does to improve the performance of mesh networks.","title":"NEDG: Contention-Awareness in Mesh Transport: Theory and Practice","awardID":"0832161","effectiveDate":"2008-08-15","expirationDate":"2012-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}}],"PIcoPI":["553707",382322],"PO":["557315"]},"143678":{"abstract":"Balancing environmental, economic, and societal needs for a sustainable future encompasses problems of unprecedented size and complexity.

There is a key role to be played by computing and information sciences in increasing the efficiency and effectiveness in the way humanity manages and allocates natural resources. Toward that objective, this Expedition aims to establish and nurture a new field of study--Computational Sustainability--driven by a wide range of hard computational problems and critical challenges in the area of sustainability.

The instrumentation includes the development of high data rate acoustic modems (Aqua-Modems), energy efficient integrated underwater nodes (Aqua-Motes), and experimental underwater sensor network (lab and field) testbeds. The Aqua-Modems lead the new generation of acoustic modem design supporting two features: <br\/>- High data rate and robust data transmission and <br\/>- Advanced networking functionalities.<br\/>The aqua-Motes will be the first generation of 'true' integrated underwater sensor nodes, similar to Berkeley Motes for terrestrial sensor networks. The two types of Aqua-Motes will be constructed with different processors for easy adaptation to a wide range of applications. The lab and field testbeds with Aqua-Modems and Aqua-Motes will be used to test various algorithms and protocols designed for UWSNs. UWSNs are novel and significantly different from any terrestrial sensor network. Due to the high coefficient of electromagnetic absorption, radio does not work well in water. Instead, acoustic communication is usually employed. The unique characteristics of acoustic underwater communication, such as low bandwidth, long propagation delay, and high error rate, pose grand challenges to underwater acoustic modem and network designers as existing terrestrial wireless sensor network techniques cannot be applied. New research at every level of the protocol suite and new experimental instrumentation are needed to implement, test, and compare design alternatives and potential solutions. This instrument enables the latter to address the continuing and growing interest in observing oceanic processes as they evolve. There is an increasing need to monitor the marine environment for commercial exploration, coastline protection, and tracking processes that contribute to the observed complexity. By deploying distributed and scalable sensor networks in a 3-dimensional underwater space, each underwater sensor can monitor and detect environmental parameters and events locally. Processes occur within the water mass as it advects and disperses within the environment in the dynamic ocean system. Therefore a langrangian observation system with passively mobile sensors (with water currents) allows observation of oceanic processes in situ on appropriate time and space scales. A self-organizing network of lagrangian sensors also provides better support for sensing, monitoring, surveillance, scheduling, underwater control, and fault tolerance. Thus, the UWSN will provide this support.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts:<br\/> This project promotes progress on the multiple issues facing UWSNs towards practical solutions in a wide range of applications. Furthermore, it impacts education in several fronts: supporting graduate students in their advanced research and undergraduates summer interns (including community college students participating in programs that promote STEM disciplines to underserved minorities) and bringing together investigators from different disciplines (e.g., ocean science, sensors, low energy, and networking) to learn from each other and collaborate across departments and campuses.","title":"MRI: Development of Instrumentation for an Autonomous Underwater Sensor Network System","awardID":"0821597","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2012-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1189","name":"MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}}],"PIcoPI":["564446","547019","546033","526410","550179"],"PO":["557609"]},"144426":{"abstract":"This award gives travel, housing, and registration-cost support to selected doctoral students from U.S. universities for their participation in the Doctoral Consortium of the 18th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS-08) held September 14-18 in Sydney, Australia.

The emerging area of distributed approximation algorithms lies at the intersection of two well-established theoretical computer science areas: distributed computing and approximation algorithms. Distributed approximation algorithms tradeoff optimality of the solution for the amount of resources consumed by the distributed algorithm. Besides a fundamental theoretical interest in understanding the algorithmic complexity of distributed approximation, there is also a practical motivation in studying distributed approximation algorithms. Emerging networking technologies such as ad hoc wireless sensor networks and peer-to-peer networks operate under inherent resource constraints such as energy, bandwidth etc. A distributed algorithm which exchanges a large number of messages and takes a lot of time can consume a relatively large amount of resources, and is not suitable in a resource-constrained network. Also, the topology of these networks can change dynamically. Communication cost and running time is especially crucial in a dynamic setting. Hence it becomes necessary to design efficient distributed algorithms for various network optimization problems that have low communication and time complexity, even possibly at the cost of a reduced quality of solution.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development and analysis of new efficient distributed approximation algorithms for important network optimization problems including the minimum spanning tree and other spanning substructures, the minimum Steiner tree and related problems, the shortest paths problem etc. These are fundamental problems in distributed computing and are widely used primitives in distributed communication networks.<br\/><br\/>The first part of the project focuses on static networks, i.e., networks whose topology doesn't change with time. The project will design and analyze distributed approximation algorithms that give efficient performance, in terms of both time and message complexity, for a given approximation ratio. An important ingredient of the research is identifying appropriate graph parameters that capture the distributed complexity of the problem at hand. Such parameters serve as natural lower bounds and facilitate the design of optimal algorithms. An overarching goal is to develop uniform approaches to design efficient distributed approximation algorithms for a wide variety of problems.<br\/><br\/>The second part of the project focuses on design and analysis of distributed algorithms for dynamic networks, i.e., networks whose topology changes dynamically. The goal is to study efficient distributed dynamic algorithms to construct and maintain near-optimal solutions for important spanning substructure problems.

The goal is to design compact routing schemes (that is, schemes with low memory overhead) with locality-sensitive node join, leave and move operations (that is, the cost of a node move operation should be proportional to the distance the node moves). An important application of routing is the design of object location services and distributed hash tables. The novel features of this research include improved bounds on the quality of routing paths, the ability to efficiently deal with highly dynamic node operations, and fault tolerance. Further, an important goal is to provide graceful degradation: if the assumptions under which the routing and location scheme works are violated or relaxed, the failure should not be abrupt, but instead the performance should worsen only as a function of the degree to which the assumptions were relaxed.<br\/><br\/>New paradigms of computation motivated by the development of the Internet lead to viewing the computer network itself as a computer and require an understanding of computation distributed across a large-scale and unstructured networks, whose many nodes are capable of performing computations independently. A basic operation in such a system is routing: nodes should be able to send each other messages without necessarily having complete information about the network. The messages should be sent along efficient routes, and individual nodes should not be required to store too much information about the network structure. Further, the network may change over time, with nodes joining or leaving, or moving within the network. An additional complication arises when fault tolerance is considered, since the system must be able to continue working correctly even in the presence of faults. This project will advance our understanding of the structure of networks that we rely on in everyday life, improve the efficiency and reduce the vulnerability of computer networks and applications, thus contributing to the development and deployment of secure network applications and infrastructure.

Furthermore, the deformation is angle preserving. The Poincare's conjecture and Thurton's geometrization conjecture generalize the fact to three dimensional manifolds. Basically, a three manifold can be decomposed to pieces in a canonical way, with each piece admitting one of eight geometries. The canonical Riemannian metric plays important roles in many engineering applications, such as hexahedral meshing, volumetric parameterization and volumetric spline construction. The proof of Poincare's conjecture offers a powerful tool to compute such metrics, Ricci flow. The Ricci flow is the process to deform the Riemannian metric proportional to the curvature, such that the curvature evolves according to heat diffusion. Eventually, the curvature is constant everywhere, and the canonical metric is achieved. The proposal aims at designing and implementing discrete curvature flow for volumes, and apply it in graphics, geometric modeling, medical imaging and many other engineering fields. <br\/><br\/>The 3-manifolds are represented as tetrahedral meshes. The edge lengths and dihedral angles encode the Riemannian metric and curvatures of the mesh. Discrete curvature flow deforms the edge lengths according to the curvatures, such that at the steady state, the curvature is constant everywhere. Discrete curvature flow can be formulated as the gradient flow of special energy forms. The energies can be optimized using Newton's method; the critical point gives the desired metric. Furthermore, the proposal also uses volumetric harmonic differential forms to compute the geometric structures based on Hodge theory. The discrete curvature flow method is proposed to tackle several important engineering applications. Hexahedral meshing has been the Holy Grail in meshing research field for years. By deforming the volume to simpler shapes and tessellating the deformed volume, hex-remeshing can be obtained straightforwardly. Volumetric parameterization is the foundation for texture mapping, shape matching, registration and comparison. Curvature flow maps general volumes to canonical shapes, which induces natural parameterizations. Constructing volumetric splines, which is consistent with the boundary surface spline, is a long lasting open problem in geometric modeling field. The curvature flow method can offer new insights and tools to tackle the problem.","title":"SGER: Discrete Volumetric Curvature Flow for Graphics Applications","awardID":"0841514","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2009-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7453","name":"GRAPHICS & VISUALIZATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["519258"],"PO":["565157"]},"143217":{"abstract":"Computational complexity theory focuses on understanding capabilities of resource bounded computations.

Projects range from development of enabling technologies, such as programming models and performance analysis tools for parallel systems, to computational science and engineering research that includes techniques for automated verification of complex hardware and software designs, data mining of multiple whole genomes, studying large-scale ecological dynamics, determining the properties of nanophotonic structures through simulation, simulating protein dynamics to study flexibility and function, modeling transport properties in biophysical systems, and understanding fluid structure interactions in physiological systems and engineering designs. The increase in the number of CPU hours available for shared research computing contributes to support the explosive growth of computational research. Hence, more tightly coupled computing can be supported at a higher scale; a centralized computing facility can be scheduled for higher utilization; a single system can be operated and administered (rather than collections of cluster for individual research groups, and may effectively on-ramp national resources. Operating this modest-size computational cluster locally complements the TeraGrid and accelerates research. In particular, higher bandwidth and lower latency to the desktop from a local system better supports code development using interactive tools with graphical user interfaces (e.g., for debugging, performance, and scalability analysis, and data visualization) while preparing codes for execution on national-scale resources.

The instrument integrates the multimodal representation of large-scale data with human-scale visualization and interaction techniques in a novel immersive environment known as the Allosphere. The Allosphere is a three-story cubic space in the new California NanoSystems Institute, housing a large perforated metal sphere that serves as a display surface. A bridge that can hold 25 participants cuts through the center of the sphere from the second floor. The final Allosphere instrumentation design is expected to include 14 resolution stereo video projectors to light up the complete spherical display surface, 256 speakers distributed outside to provide high quality spatial sounds, a suite of sensors and interaction devices to enable rich user interaction with the data and simulations, and the computing infrastructure to enable the high volume computations necessary to provide a rich visual, aural, and interactive experience for the user. When fully constructed, the Allosphere is expected to be one of the largest scientific instruments in the world. It will serve as an ongoing research testbed for scientific visualization, numerical simulations, large-scale sensor networks, high-performance computing, data mining, knowledge discovery, multimedia systems, and human-computer interaction. This unique immersive exploration environment, with a full surrounding sphere of high quality stereo video and spatial sound and user tracking for rich interaction will support rich interaction and exploration. Partnering with faculty from several disciplines, it will also serve as a key tool for exploration in molecular dynamics, brain imaging, nanomaterials, earth science, and many other scientific fields. For example, navigating through fMRI data and exploring live geospatial datasets.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This project benefits many important fields that have wide impact on society.

While rendering systems can exploit these data to achieve greatly improved performance and visual fidelity, such datasets also present significant challenges for efficient processing, not only because of their large scale and high dimensionality, but more importantly, because of their intrinsic nonlinear structures. That is, the data naturally contain very high frequency, rapidly changing information that cannot be adequately represented using linear processing models that prevail elsewhere in computer graphics.<br\/><br\/>This project develops nonlinear processing methods for large-scale, multidimensional light transport data. These nonlinear methods adaptively select the best solutions for representation driven by the data?s intrinsic nonlinear structure, thereby significantly improving the sampling, compression, reduction, and reconstruction of such data. The project involves three steps of research. The first step collects light transport data from both simulated and measured sources, and derives a novel sampling strategy by using data-driven analysis. In the second step, the PI investigates several new methods for nonlinearly reducing and approximating light transport data into compact representations. These methods include nonlinear basis projection, clustered piecewise constant approximation, and augmented dimensionality reduction. The third step develops efficient computational methods using the compressed data representation for fast reconstruction and real-time visualization. These methods are naturally amenable to acceleration on modern graphics hardware. The resulting new approaches from this research can leverage broader applications in other fields that involve similar types of image datasets, such as geosciences, medical imaging, and forensic analysis.","title":"CAREER: Nonlinear Processing of Light Transport Data for Realistic Computer Imagery","awardID":"0746577","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2013-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7453","name":"GRAPHICS & VISUALIZATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["521885"],"PO":["532791"]},"136739":{"abstract":"This grant provides funding for the development of optimization tools and data structures for a wide class of deterministic and stochastic optimization problems.

A combination of arbitrary designs of routing components with a routing metric may result in catastrophe on a network's normal operation, such as routing loops, inconsistent routing decisions, suboptimal paths and routing instability. Previous works for modeling routing metric designs focused on several IP routing protocols deployed for the Internet. There remains a serious lack of understanding of the compatibility issue for wireless networks. The objective of this project is to address this challenging issue by systematically studying the fundamental compatibility space of routing metrics for different wireless routing designs.

The routing theory developed in this proposed project is a major step in the understanding of interoperability and compatibility between wireless routing protocols. In addition, the theory of compatible routing designs also brings insights for developing flexible wireless routing architecture so that designs that potentially may put too many restrictions on the development of routing metrics can be avoided.

This project will investigate this question by studying the rat whisker (vibrissal) system. Rats move their whiskers back and forth to touch and explore different objects, much as humans use their hands. The tactile information is conveyed from the base of the whiskers through a series of processing stages in the brain. This research project focuses on understanding the processing that occurs in the second stage, in a brain structure called \"spinal trigeminal nucleus interpolaris\" (SpVi). In the first part of the project, computer simulations and robotic models will be used to test the plausibility of the different types of processing that might occur in SpVi. In the second part of the project, technology to measure the precise contact times and locations of a rat's whiskers with different objects will be developed. Finally, in the third part of the project, electrical signals from neurons in SpVi, will be recorded and correlated with the animal's ongoing behavior as it touches different objects. The results that emerge will allow the testing of three different hypotheses for the processing that occurs in SpVi. Regardless of which hypothesis(es) is\/are found to be correct, the results will improve the understanding of how the brain combines sensing and movement to allow animals to perceive the world. This project will contribute to the interdisciplinary training of two graduate students and to ongoing graduate-level course development at Northwestern University. It will also provide meaningful research opportunities in engineering for at least six undergraduates, with a specific effort made to include women and underrepresented minorities.","title":"Spatiotemporal Structure of Sensory Acquisition Behaviors: Experiments on the Rat Vibrissal System","awardID":"0818414","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2012-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7353","name":"EMERGING MODELS & TECHNOLOGIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"7713","name":"ACTIVATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["513124"],"PO":["565284"]},"144948":{"abstract":"Abstract <br\/>NACLO is a high school Olympiad contest in linguistics and language technologies.

However, as these platforms continue to evolve, they are becoming increasingly complex to design and implement for a given application. Much of the complexity associated with sensor-based platforms is due to the plethora of parameters that must be considered. To further complicate matters, application developers oftentimes are not trained engineers, but rather biologists, teachers, or agriculturists who wish to utilize the sensor-based systems within their given domain. Faced with an overwhelming number of choices, application design may be a daunting task for non-experts. This project seeks to alleviate some of the complexities associated with sensor-based system design through the use of automated optimization methods that abstract many of the underlying design and platform details, dynamic profiling methods capable of observing application-level behavior, and dynamic optimization to tune the underlying platform accordingly. Dynamic profiling enables an accurate view of the application behavior and allows the system to monitor how the application responds to changing environmental conditions or changes in the platform itself. If the developer specified performance metrics are not currently being met, dynamic optimization and network reconfiguration can adapt the deployed network to its current surroundings and application requirements. This dynamic profiling and optimization environment reduces developer effort and increases the accessibility of sensor-based systems to a wider audience, where we believe such systems can enhance everyday lives, and further the emergence of innovative applications.","title":"Collaborative Research: CSR-EHCS, SM: DPOP - A Dynamic Profiling and Optimization Platform for Sensor-Based Networks","awardID":"0834080","effectiveDate":"2008-08-15","expirationDate":"2011-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["507807"],"PO":["561889"]},"141319":{"abstract":"Proposal #: CNS 08-21345<br\/>PI(s): Rishe, Naphtali D.<br\/> Christidis, Evangelos; Li, Tao; Rangaswami, Raju<br\/>Institution: Florida International University <br\/> Miami, FL 33174-2516<br\/>Title: MRI\/Dev.: Dev. Of a High Performance Database Appliance for Geospatial Applications<br\/>Project Proposed:<br\/>This project, developing a high-performance next-generation hardware\/software instrument able to efficiently perform complex geospatial and other queries, enables close-to-storage complex operations related to geospatial data transformation and querying, including data search with information retrieval (keywords), structural (SQL), and geospatial criteria. This replicable instrument consists of a scalable storage and computation cloud comprising an array of processors, each equipped with solid-state disks (SSD) and mechanical disks. This coupling of processors to SSDs allows an order of magnitude in performance improvement for many geospatial problems. The work entails adapting existing spatial database management, querying, and interface systems to this new architecture and deploying open-standard APIs. The instrument will include a base-map comprising nationwide aerial photography, street vectors, demographics, and cadastre data. For completeness of the basemap, most of the data (40TB) already assembled, ameliorated, and mosaiced for the TerraFly project that will be ported into the instrument, requires expansion. The instrument facilitates several areas in computer science research, including query algorithms, storage systems, geographic information systems (GIS), and data mining, feature recognition, and visualization. Examples of enabled research on algorithms range from optimization of query filtering on keywords 'containment in the objects' description to enriching spatial query languages to incorporate IR constraints and creating complex personalized ranking functions that consider the shape, location, and textual description of objects. Many examples involve feature recognition, appropriately serving multiple computer science and disaster mitigation research areas. Moreover, the enablement of real-time multi-dimensional indexing, combined with the multitude of geospatial data, also facilitates applied research in disaster management (e.g., use of high-resolution hurricane impact models to predict the possibility of damage on a house-by-house basis).<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This project enables applications in environmental monitoring, transportation, education, public health, and safety. By providing efficient spatial and temporal management of data needed by many constituencies such as disaster management, the instrument broadly benefits society. Specifically, the instrument impacts computer science and disaster mitigation research nationwide. Once the instrument is successfully commercialized, it should also serve many critical government and business applications requiring high-performance querying of very large geospatial databases. Furthermore, many students in this Minority Serving University (MSI) are likely to be inspired to continue towards a graduate degree and\/or benefit by continuing their careers in science and engineering.","title":"MRI: Development of a High-Performance Database Appliance for Geospatial Applications","awardID":"0821345","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2013-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1189","name":"MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7359","name":"COMPUTING RES INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0707","name":"Division of INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION & PARTNE","abbr":"IIP"},"pgm":{"id":"1504","name":"GRANT OPP FOR ACAD LIA W\/INDUS"}}],"PIcoPI":["558108","550720","550842","516939"],"PO":["557609"]},"140934":{"abstract":"Proposal Number 0819882<br\/><br\/>TITLE: Dynamic Deadlock Avoidance in Concurrent Software via Discrete Control<br\/><br\/>PI: Stephane Lafortune<br\/>Co-PI: Scott Mahlke<br\/><br\/>Ensuring deadlock-free execution of concurrent programs is an increasingly important problem as multi-core processors compel performance-conscious software developers to parallelize applications. A novel methodology for dynamically controlling the execution of concurrent software in order to provably avoid deadlocks is proposed. It addresses today's dominant concurrent programming paradigm, multi-threaded programs that employ locks. In this approach, the responsibilities for deadlock avoidance are placed upon a feedback controller that is automatically synthesized from application software source code. A model of the source code will automatically be constructed from a whole-program control flow graph obtained at compile time. The feedback controller will be synthesized offline from the model using techniques from discrete control theory and used to instrument the code. At run-time, the controller will operate by carefully managing lock acquisition and release to ensure that potential deadlock states are never entered. The research plan of this proposal presents a systematic approach for the development, implementation, performance evaluation, and classroom deployment of this novel methodology. By allowing deadlock-free execution of programs via automated feedback control, the full value of unmodified legacy code will be preserved and programmers will be empowered to write code with increased safety, confidence, and productivity.","title":"Dynamic Deadlock Avoidance in Concurrent Software via Discrete Control","awardID":"0819882","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2012-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7724","name":"SOFTWARE FOR REAL-WORLD SYSTMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["497008","518034"],"PO":["564388"]},"141408":{"abstract":"Project Proposed:<br\/><br\/>This project, acquiring a wireless nanonetworks integration and emulation system, aims at establishing an ultra wideband Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFIC) design flow for the development and testing of RF nodes.

On the one hand, modern 3D scanning systems faithfully capture an object?s shape, but recover very little information about its material properties (often only a crude estimate of its diffuse albedo). On the other hand, techniques for measuring a surface?s spatially- and directionally-dependent appearance require a precise 3D model of the sample, usually obtained through a separate procedure. Although researchers have made significant progress on both fronts, shape and appearance acquisition have largely been studied separately. As a result, the few existing pipelines that allow synchronous capture suffer from cumbersome and error-prone registration steps, impractical calibration standards, and fail to take advantage of the potential benefits that a combined analysis would allow.<br\/><br\/>This research investigates new optical scanners and accompanying algorithms to provide a complete pipeline for automated and synchronous measurement of shape and surface appearance.

With progress in computer graphics allowing increasingly realistic rendering of forms and motion, the uncanny valley has become a high-stakes concern of the entertainment industry.

With the growing accuracy of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurement and analysis techniques, there is a new tool with which to answer these questions. The PIs are using fMRI, eye tracking, and traditional perceptual metrics to explore the existence of and causes of the uncanny valley.

All major commercial processor vendors are now committed to increasing the number of processors (i.e. ?cores?) that fit on a single chip. However, there are major obstacles of power consumption, performance and scalability in existing synchronous design methodologies. This proposal focuses on a particular existing easy-to-program and easy-to-teach multi-core architecture. It then identifies the interconnection network, connecting multiples cores and memories, as the critical bottleneck to achieving lower overall power consumption. The target is to substantially improve the power, robustness and scalability of the system by designing and fabricating a high-speed asynchronous communication mesh. The resulting parallel architecture will be globally-asynchronous locally-synchronous (i.e. GALS-style), that gracefully accommodates synchronous cores and memories operating at arbitrary unrelated clock rates, while providing robustness to timing variability and support for ?plug-and-play? (i.e. scalable) system design. Unlike most prior GALS architectures, this one will have significant performance and power requirements in a complex pipelined topology. In addition, computer-aided design (i.e. CAD) tools will be developed to support the design of this new mesh, as well as simulation, timing verification and performance analysis tools to be applied to the entire parallel architecture. This work will be performed in collaboration with a separate NSF CPA proposal under Prof. Ken Stevens (University of Utah). The two proposals will be linked together into a larger framework: the Utah group will coordinate to provide and refine their commercial-based physical design tool development and support, while the Columbia\/Maryland group will provide a new substantial test case for their asynchronous tool applications.<br\/><br\/>The work is expected to have broad impact. First, while it is targeted to one parallel architecture, several other architectures will benefit from this work, since the interconnection network can be applied to them as well. Second, the work is expected to demonstrate the benefits and role of asynchronous design for complex high-performance systems. Finally, the outcome of the work could make a step in the paradigm shift from serial to parallel that the field is now undergoing; the resulting first-of-its-kind partly-asynchronous high-end massively-parallel on-chip computer could push the level of scalability beyond what it currently possible and have a broad impact in supporting parallel applications in much of computer science and engineering.","title":"CPA-DA-T: Design and Tools for Easy-to-Program Massively Parallel On-Chip Systems: Deriving Scalability through Asynchrony","awardID":"0811504","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2013-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["508237","518562"],"PO":["562984"]},"139382":{"abstract":"The successive innovations in semiconductor manufacturing over the<br\/>last 35 years of Moore's law have turned what used to be a room-sized<br\/>computer system into a single chip composed of billions of<br\/>transistors.

Assessing image fidelity is an important aspect of realistic imaging that has broad implications in both computer graphics and digital photography. Recently perceptual metrics based on computational models of human vision have been used to characterize image fidelity; but these metrics typically characterize pixel-wise image differences. When we look at images we don?t see pixels, we see objects with distinct shapes, sizes, materials, and motions. Therefore, there is a need for image fidelity metrics that characterize the appearance properties of objects. This project introduces a new standard for image fidelity called visual equivalence. Images are visually equivalent if they convey the same information about object appearance (shape, material, lighting), even if they are different pixel-by-pixel. This new standard fundamentally expands the scope of how to assess image fidelity, providing a metric that is based on higher-level properties of visual coding.<br\/><br\/>This project seeks to understand and leverage the phenomenon of visual equivalence by: a) conducting a series of psychophysical experiments that develop a foundation for visual equivalence by exploring interactions between the geometry, material and illumination properties of objects in complex scenes; b) developing visual equivalence predictors that apply to a wide range of scenes; and c) demonstrating the practical utility of the concept of visual equivalence in a range of applications including high-fidelity environment map compression and scalable rendering of complex scenes. The products of this research provide valuable new tools for addressing one of the grand challenges in computer graphics: the high performance, high fidelity image synthesis of complex scenes. Further, this new approach to image fidelity should have a significant impact beyond graphics in areas including 2d and 3d digital image acquisition, coding, compression, transmission, storage, and display.","title":"CPA-G&V:Collaborative Research: Visual Equivalence: A New Foundation for Perceptually-Based Rendering of Complex Scenes","awardID":"0811032","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2012-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["474957"],"PO":["532791"]},"145390":{"abstract":"This is a 12-month standard award to support a Organizational Communication and Information Systems (OCIS) Doctoral Colloquium program at the Academy of Management Conference to be held in Anaheim, CA (August 8-13, 2008).

The literature continues to show that specialized assistive technologies are often abandoned or never acquired due to cost, complexity, configuration, maintenance, unavailability, and the need for training. Instead, commodity devices like everyday mice and trackballs are widely used by many people with motor impairments, but current graphical user interfaces are not well matched to the abilities of these users. In this project, rather than attempting the tired approach of adapting special users to standard point-and-click interfaces, the PI's goal is to radically change user interfaces to be better suited to users, by removing the two major obstacles to successful human-computer interaction for people with motor impairments: the need to point to confined areas, and the need to click within them. The PI will accomplish these objectives with goal crossing, an interaction technique in which people only need to move their mouse across a threshold without acquiring an area or executing a stable click. Although goal crossing has been studied and employed in pen-based interfaces, it has not been employed in mouse-based interfaces or for improving computer access. Goal crossing in mouse-based interfaces is challenging because of the occlusion problem, where an unwanted goal lies in front of a desired one (although the mouse button could be used to disambiguate, people with motor impairments cannot reliably drag). Nevertheless, a preliminary study conducted by the PI found that goal crossing has higher throughput, is faster, and exhibits more path and submovement accuracy than area pointing for people with motor impairments. The PI will leverage these performance findings in the current project, in the creation of accessible goal crossing user interfaces. He will do this through the following four steps: Development and evaluation of crossing widgets (this step will employ a highly iterative process to create interactive prototypes and testing them with people with motor impairments); Creation and evaluation of exemplar crossing applications (this step will build three exemplar applications for text editing, drawing, and photos that will explore crossing widget layout, grouping, and interaction); Development of a programmers' toolbox for crossing widgets (this step will create and deploy a crossing widget toolbox to enable developers to create crossing-based applications); Creation of the SUPPLE-X automatic user interface generator (an automatic user interface generator based on SUPPLE++ that is capable of creating ability-based goal crossing interfaces by measuring users' functional capabilities).

Agent-based modeling is a method of simulating discrete dynamic systems from the bottom up. It is a computational representation where the population behaviors result from the local interactions of the constituent entities (agents) of the system. In modeling biological systems in particular, these populations can range into the hundreds of millions. Current generation ABM simulation toolkits are designed to execute serially on the CPU. Large scale models are intractable on such systems. We are exploring newer data-parallel architectures, in particular GPUs, to execute ABMs. The challenge that we are addressing in this project is to develop novel methods for agent state representation and manipulation that align well with the computing model of the GPUs. These methods include techniques for handling collision-free motion, fast parallel memory allocation for agent replication, and efficient statistic gathering for studying asymptotic behaviors, all computed in parallel on the GPU. We are applying these methods to two problems in biomedical engineering, namely, Systemic Inflammatory Response and Hepatic Drug Disposition and comparing the results of our implementations for statistical similarity with results from implementations on CPU-based ABM toolkits such as NetLogo and SWARM. <br\/><br\/>This research, if successful, will revolutionize agent-based modeling with significant impact on disciplines such as ecology, medicine, economics, and homeland security. Our techniques will effectively democratize super-computing for ABM researchers by providing tools powerful enough to simulate realistic models on inexpensive desktop computers. With the improved scalability and speed, scientists will be able to investigate entirely new emergent phenomena. Previously intractable problems such as simulating the social behavior of entire countries or simulating complete ecosystems will be possible.","title":"SGER: Exploring Data-Parallel Techniques for Mega-Scale Agent Based Model Simulations on Graphics Processing Units","awardID":"0840666","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2010-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"4080","name":"ADVANCED COMP RESEARCH PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":[387870,"484022"],"PO":["427499"]},"139660":{"abstract":"This research project will develop methods and algorithms to assist people with the procedures required to operate their home medical devices without errors. The goal is for the system to be trained on sample recordings of the person operating the device correctly, so that later it will be able to detect deviations from the correct operation sequence in the currently performed procedure, and automatically provide corrective feedback to the user, including segments of the video portions that show the appropriate steps. The project provides a new paradigm for learning by observation that does not require complete understanding of detailed activities in arbitrary visual and sensor sequences, but merely aligns a given new sequence in known context with previously established training data to detect significant deviations. The approach has four components: (1) defining the key states in an operational procedure and the sensors required to best detect and later communicate the proper operation of a portable home medical device; (2) training the system by observing multiple correct operations; (3) observing a new instance of the operation sequence and recognizing that this operation deviates from the training data in a significant way; and (4) providing corrective feedback to the user in the form of audio and video prompts. The research aims to understand the common types of steps required in the operations of home medical devices, map how the critical indicators of these steps can be detected through appropriate sensors, train a system to recognize these steps in the context of a specific human operator, establish a range of required training repetitions for different operational step types and corresponding sensors, and provide a set of suitable interventions to the end user when errors occur. The experiments will establish the range of training data set sizes for the automated classification of device operations. The research expects to yield a taxonomy of typical operational steps from an observational perspective for a set of devices such as infusion pumps, and establish the most effective sensors or sensor combinations to detect the successful completion of each type of step. In addition, the work will help find suitable passages in the video portion of the training observations to use as corrective feedback, together with other interactive dialog interventions that may be appropriate for the particular user. <br\/><br\/>The long-term goal of this research is to develop a cognitive assistance system to learn and represent sequences of steps in the operation of home medical devices through multi-sensor observation and interaction with a human operator. Examples of some of the targeted home healthcare devices are respirators and nebulizers (to help breathing), dialysis machines, infusion pumps, home monitoring devices for blood pulse oxygen, EEG, and ECG. The project will develop a means for home users of these devices to ensure that the correct procedures are followed and accurate operations result. The system provides ongoing feedback to assist users in their device operation by ?watching? the process via different sensing technologies and providing appropriate guidance when required. The target population immediately benefiting from this work would be patients with mild cognitive impairments who would be supported with the automated coach in their use of home medical devices. The growing user base includes elderly people living at home, but requiring support from home medical devices. These medical devices can allow a patient to live independently with minimal assistance, as long as the home medical devices provide the required health support. The end result may be a reduction in errors and in the number of calls for assistance in the operation and maintenance of home medical devices. This will allow people to live independently at home for an average longer period than at present and thereby reduce health care system costs. The research is valuable for medical device companies with respect to device design, verification, and validation processes, offering insights into what sensors and communication devices could be most beneficial for integration into the device itself.","title":"HCC-Small: A Cognitive Assistive System for Coaching the Use of Home Medical Devices","awardID":"0812465","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2012-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["533348",371225,371226],"PO":["565227"]},"139671":{"abstract":"This research will evaluate the potential of a new generation of electronic document readers that present information across multiple displays - a design that anticipates the future availability of fast, bi-stable, display technology.

Accurate, yet computationally efficient noise models will be developed and combined with noise reduction techniques to effectively control the signal characteristics within a system. Leveraging the classical noise propagation model from communications, a novel unified approach will be applied to model noise generation, propagation, and reception among diverse system components, supporting the development of aggregate noise cancellation techniques. Design tradeoffs to alleviate the effects of multiple noise sources will be investigated and design guidelines will be developed. The interdependence among diverse noise effects at the device, circuit, and multi-core levels will be investigated and design strategies that minimize noise across mixed-signal components will be developed. Emphasis will be placed on the global features responsible for generating and propagating noise among different system components, such as the power distribution networks, the global interconnect lines, the inter-core synchronization schemes, and the silicon substrate. The sensitivity of the noise models and reduction techniques to process and environmental variations will also be investigated. The ultimate objective is that upon completion of this project, signal uncertainty in analog circuits and delay uncertainty in digital circuits due to multiple noise effects in multi-core SoCs will be better understood and accurately modeled in a computationally efficient manner, while integrated noise reduction methodologies will be developed to design the next generation of high complexity, high performance integrated circuits. <br\/><br\/>These research results will provide new directions for educational initiatives targeting both university teaching and research activities in the broader academic community.

Researchers are now discovering that not all errors cause a failure. Some errors can be masked within the circuits as not all inputs affect final results. By preventing all errors rather than only those errors that change a result, time and power get wasted. This project proposes to explore techniques which allow errors to occur that do not change final results. In many applications such as facial recognition or voice recognition, many of the data errors will not be noticed by the software, depending on the particular data. For example, if we one bit gets flipped in an incoming audio signal for voice recognition, it may not affect the result at all. The proper word may be recognized despite the error in one sample. A key observation, however, is that even these applications are not very resistant to control flow errors. For example, if the voice recognition software stops before it completes its analysis of the audio signal, the wrong word would most likely be recognized leading to failure. <br\/><br\/>This project explores how to take advantage of partial tolerance to unreliability. More efficient reliability mechanisms can be designed that are targeted towards only the important instructions, not all instructions. In even more tolerant applications, errors can be introduced into the system in order to speed up the system--allowing the process to proceed without waiting for slow operations. In order to discover and exploit error-tolerance, this project will identify 10-15 applications that are tolerant to errors, develop heuristics to determine which instructions are more tolerant to error than others, develop specific techniques for efficiently protecting only critical instructions from errors, and develop mechanisms to introduce errors into less important, high-latency instructions in order to save power and\/or improve performance.","title":"CAREER: Horseshoes and Hand Grenades: Exploiting Error Tolerance in Applications","awardID":"0855889","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2012-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["528013"],"PO":["559883"]},"139365":{"abstract":"Modern software systems involve millions of lines of code.

Informal specification documents present protocols through both descriptions and examples using a combination of diagrams, tables and carefully-written prose. Validation artifacts, in contrast, are consumed by tools and require precise behavioral details. Generating validation artifacts from informal documentation is a laborious manual task. Automating it, however, is challenging given the inherent gap between the informal and formal representations. This proposal aims to partially automate the extraction of RTL assertions from informal bus protocol specifications. The PI will develop a novel intermediate language for describing these protocols that reflects the structure and notations of informal specifications. The software tools envisioned will produce (1) a partial yet executable formal model from an informal specification and (2) a set of details that a human engineer needs to check or provide. After the engineer modifies the model to clarify these details, the tools will generate validation artifacts from the refined formal model. This process focuses the engineer's effort on closing the gap between the informal and formal specification, the task that actually requires human intervention, rather than on the more mundane transcription tasks in the current manual process.<br\/><br\/>If this project is successful, it will yield a much lighter-weight process for creating needed validation artifacts from informal specifications. This in turn will simplify the validation process itself, an increasingly time-consuming yet critical part of hardware design. As validation has become a bottleneck in hardware design, the project has the potential to improve modern hardware development practice. Additionally, the students involved in this project will gain skills in working at the boundary between informal and formal representations of designs. Such skills are increasingly valuable for researchers as users of information technologies diversify beyond those with graduate training in the field.","title":"CPA-DA: From Informal Specifications to RTL Assertions for Bus Protocols","awardID":"0811067","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2012-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7945","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYST"}}],"PIcoPI":["485803"],"PO":["562984"]},"134580":{"abstract":"Project ID: 0747423 <br\/>Title: Parallel CAD Algorithms on Emerging Multi-Core Platforms<br\/>PI name: Li, Peng <br\/>Inst.: Texas Engineering Experiment Station<br\/><br\/><br\/>ABSTRACT<br\/>The recent industry?s shift to multi-core processor technology has literally made every modern-day desktop, sever, and laptop a parallel computing system. With multiple processing elements, or cores, integrated on a single chip, multi-core processors offer unprecedented, ubiquitously available parallel compute power. The paradigm change in computing has profound impacts on computer-aided design (CAD) of today?s ever complex nanoscale integrated circuits. This CAREER project intends to address the new computing challenges and opportunities as the current serial CAD practices transition to the future massively parallel paradigms, as dictated by the need to keep up with the increase in design complexity. The central approach of this work is to bring indispensable domain knowledge to parallel algorithm design so as to facilitate the most efficient use of emerging parallel hardware. A rich set of application-level coarse-grained parallelisms will be exploited under the single and multiple algorithm contexts to gain good parallel processing efficiency on multi-core and many-core platforms. A range of parallel CAD algorithms, encompassing key analysis, modeling and optimization steps in the design flow, will be developed. This work will lead to massively parallel CAD frameworks and tools that are critical to the design of a wide spectrum of nanometer digital, analog and mixed-signal integrated applications. <br\/><br\/>The computationally intensive nature of VLSI CAD makes it an important application domain of multi-core computing. The proposed work addresses the urgent need for developing parallel software applications and the resulting parallel computing paradigms are likely to be applicable to other science and engineering fields. As integral parts of this CAREER plan, education and research efforts will be integrated to provide research experience to undergraduate and graduate students. Research participation from minority and underrepresented student groups as well as K-12 education outreach will be actively promoted through existing research, outreach programs and inter-university collaborations. The PI will integrate the research outcomes of this project into undergraduate and graduate curriculum development and broadly disseminate them to academic, governmental and industrial sectors. Multidisciplinary, international and industrial collaborations will be formed to broaden the horizon of engineering students. Close industry ties will be leveraged to provide students with real-life experiences and facilitate immediate impacts of this work in industrial practice.","title":"CAREER: Parallel CAD Algorithms on Emerging Multi-Core Platforms","awardID":"0747423","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2013-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["486370"],"PO":["562984"]},"135394":{"abstract":"Homeland security and the criminal and civil justice systems increasingly require reliable and valid methods for automatically identifying the authors of anonymous documents.

To achieve this goal, the PI and his team will both adapt existing technologies in speech processing and pattern recognition, and lay the foundation for entirely novel forms of human-computer interaction. Specific devices and platforms that will be developed will be drawn from the following five categories. (1) A dialogue interpreter that facilitates the inclusion of deaf users in dual or multi-speaker conversations; the conversations are assumed to take place at a table (in the home or office), which accommodates CPUs for speech recognition and monitors for display. (2) A voice monitor that provides hard-of-hearing users with immediate, subtle feedback on the level of their vocal projections; without this feedback, inappropriate modulation can introduce awkwardness in social interactions, leading over time to withdrawal and isolation. (3) A voice compass that provides rapid directional notification during multi-speaker conversation; such a device would assist deaf lip-readers who cannot otherwise track the turns of different speakers (lip reading in this setting presumes the ability to know where to look). (4) An audio event detector that recognizes salient words, prompts, and sounds in the user's environment; such a device could notify users with hearing loss to someone calling their name or to important work-related sounds, thus reducing frustrations and boosting employability. (5) A wearable transmitter\/receiver that uses primitive speech recognition to allow a user with speech and hearing to communicate simple words to a late deafened love one; such a device would complement residual hearing, gestures, and lip-reading.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Over 35 million Americans have some form of hearing loss. Moreover, one-fifth of these cases are estimated to involve severe or profound hearing loss. Incidence of hearing loss increases with age: it affects roughly 2% of children under age 18 but over 30% of adults over age 65. Thus, the percentage of affected adults will grow with the aging of the baby-boomer generation. There is a tremendous need for better integration of people with hearing loss in the home, community, and workplace. Extreme barriers in communication often exist between members of the Deaf community and the hearing population. Even within a single household, these barriers can create a desperate sense of isolation for a family member who is deaf. In the workplace, the members of the Deaf community are as able-bodied as the rest of the population, but difficulties in communication create barriers to optimal employment and retention in current positions.","title":"HCC-Small: Assistive Listening Devices and Voice Processing Platforms for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing","awardID":"0812576","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2011-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["525662",371260],"PO":["565227"]},"139563":{"abstract":"NSF Proposal 0811865<br\/><br\/>Title: Empirical Assessment of Prediction-Driven Quality Improvement <br\/><br\/>PI: Emmet James Whitehead<br\/><br\/>In the last two years, software bug prediction techniques have become increasingly accurate and it is now realistic to begin using them in software engineering practice.

In response to the large need for personalized one-on-one care for the growing populations of elderly individuals and those with special cognitive and social needs throughout life, great strides must be made in the domain of human-robot interaction (HRI) in order to bring robotics into such application domains in human everyday life. This interdisciplinary project identifies a specific set of HRI research questions in socially assistive robotics, the study of robotic systems capable of providing help through social rather than physical interaction. The research focus is on two key issues: (1) the role of the robot's physical embodiment in the interaction; and (2) the use of expressive embodied communication and user modeling toward personalized time-extended assistive interaction. A specific consideration is given to interactions under the challenges of socio-communicative heterogeneity and deficits. A novel assistive robot control architecture is developed, based on multi-modal perception, embodied expression and communication, and on-line user modeling, implemented in three different types of real-world socially assistive systems. To give a realistic context to the research, the experimental testing and evaluation are performed with children drawn from a typical population and a population with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), a family of disorders that have already been identified as amenable to technological, and in particular robotic, intervention and therapy. A key contribution of the research lies in the unified and tightly integrated end-to-end approach that jointly studies embodiment and multimodal expressive communication, grounded in data from hypothesis-driven experiments, and the development and use of novel signal processing and user modeling methods for human-machine interaction design. <br\/><br\/>This project, by its very nature, aims to impact the large and growing population affected by Autism Spectrum Disorders.

Recent detailed comparison of numerical simulations with experiments has clearly shown the importance of capturing the dominant three-dimensional turbulent flow features. Due to prohibitive computational cost of the Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) for highly turbulent flows, the only computationally feasible alternative to resolve all eddies that dominate flow physics is Large Eddy Simulation (LES). However, current LES methodologies rely on, at best, a zonal grid adaptation strategy to attempt to minimize computational cost in resolving large eddies. While an improvement over regular grids, these methodologies fail to resolve the high wave-number components of the spatially intermittent coherent eddies that typify turbulent flows. At the same time, the flow is over-resolved in regions between the intermittent coherent eddies. Recent improvement of the LES methodology, namely the Stochastic Coherent Adaptive Large Eddy Simulation (SCALES) approach, recently developed by PI, addresses shortcomings of traditional LES approaches by using a dynamic grid adaptation strategy that resolves the most energetic coherent structures. This novel methodology has now demonstrated the ability to dynamically resolve and ?track? the most energetic part of the coherent eddies, while using a field compression that results in a reduction in the number of degrees of freedom similar to LES. This idea is to be taken one step further by applying spatially variable wavelet thresholding strategy to ensure that only a priori specified fraction of turbulent kinetic energy, subgrid scale dissipation or other statistical quantities are resolved. With such a strategy the transition between adaptive wavelet based DNS (WDNS), Coherent Vortex Simulation (CVS), and SCALES regimes is natural: the SCALES models switch to subgrid scale model for CVS to no model for WDNS approach as the percentage of the resolved turbulent kinetic energy or subgrid scale dissipation increases. This will form a basis for the new strategy of the integrated adaptive variable fidelity (WDNS\/CVS\/SCALES) eddy capturing approach. Finally, to make a planned methodology a practical engineering tool, it will be combined with Brinkman penalization to enforce solid boundaries of arbitrary complexity. A unique advantage of combining this dynamic wavelet-based grid adaptation strategy with Brinkman penalization is the ability to enforce boundary conditions to a specified precision without a significant computational overhead. The combined approach will allow for a significant cost reduction in man hours (associated with tedious grid generation) and computational costs. The final aim of this project is in education and dissemination of the newly developed approach and in distribution of the software tools to be developed as a part of the project for the wide use by the scientific community including government laboratories.","title":"Integrated Variable Fidelity Eddy Capturing Approach for Turbulent Flow Simulations","awardID":"0756046","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2011-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0702","name":"Division of CHEM, BIOENG, ENV, &  TRANSP S","abbr":"CBET"},"pgm":{"id":"1443","name":"FLUID DYNAMICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0703","name":"Division of CIVIL, MECHANICAL, & MANUFACT","abbr":"CMMI"},"pgm":{"id":"1266","name":"APPLIED MATHEMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["525383"],"PO":["525323"]},"139532":{"abstract":"Proposal No.: 811706<br\/>PI: Ha, Dong S.<br\/>Title: A New Approach to Design-for-Testability (DFT) Using Ultra Wideband and Wireless Communication Techniques<br\/>Institution: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University<br\/><br\/>ABSTRACT<br\/>A power distribution network in an IC is ubiquitous as seen by the internal logic, i.e., a power line is accessible to any internal node. This suggests the possibility of monitoring or controlling the logic value of any internal node through a power line by attaching a simple and nearly all-digital sensing\/control circuit to the node. In other words, power line communications (PLC) in an IC provides designers with an inexpensive means to access to internal nodes, which can be useful for various applications, including test application time reduction for scan design, system debugging, fault diagnosis, monitoring transient logic values during built-in self test, and on-line testing. The research investigates the feasibility and practicality of PLC in ICs with circuit testing as the major target application. Upon successful execution of the project, the major technical accomplishments are as follows. (1) it suggests a new approach to address VLSI testing problems; (2) it investigates a new area, PLC at the IC level; and (3) it develops the necessary building blocks for PLC at the IC level. The use of power lines at the IC level has not been explored before, and it offers vast new applications in VLSI testing and other areas such as intra-\/inter- chip level communications.<br\/><br\/>The outcomes of this research will be published in journals and proceedings and will be presented at technical conferences. The proposed research will also foster the integration of research and education and will be used to enhance the curriculum at the PI?s institution. This project provides an excellent opportunity to train undergraduate and underrepresented students in various electrical engineering fields, including VLSI testing, analog and mixed signal design, RFIC design, and circuit and system level simulation. An initial feasibility study for the proposed research has been conducted in close collaboration with a major US semiconductor company, and several other US semiconductor companies also have committed to collaborate in the proposed research. Close collaboration with those companies will provide a direct path to commercialization of the research at the successful conclusion of the project.","title":"A New Approach to Design-for-Testability (DFT) Using Ultra Wideband and Wireless Communication Techniques","awardID":"0811706","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2012-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4710","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7945","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYST"}}],"PIcoPI":["475415"],"PO":["562984"]},"139543":{"abstract":"PROPOSAL ID: 0811770<br\/>PI: HIGGS, CECIL F.<br\/>INSTITUTION: CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY<br\/>TITLE: A 3D CMP-AWARE NANOSCALE IC DESIGN METHODOLOGY USING PHYSICS-BASED MODELING WITH SILICON VALIDATION VIA TEST AND DIAGNOSIS<br\/><br\/><br\/>ABSTRACT<br\/>It is well known that ?Moore?s Law? states that computer chips will double their speed nearly every two years due to technological advancement. This advancement is typically due to the size of the transistors on the chip which are rapidly becoming as small as a nanometer (which is 1000 times thinner than a human hair). Since the transistors are smaller, more of them can be put on a chip which leads to faster computational times. Unfortunately, the processes needed to manufacturing these computer chips are highly complex and the final product often comes out defective or with lower performance than the original design. One particular manufacturing process, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), is a major contributor to performance degradation and manufacturing costs. By combining chip defect testing models with advanced CMP computer models, the principal investigators (PIs) propose to research and develop a breakthrough computational methodology for predicting the impact of the CMP manufacturing process on the chip at the design stage. <br\/><br\/>CMP is a complex process in which the wafer surface that contains the chips is polished by pressing it against a rotating pad that is flooded with a slurry consisting of a fluid with abrasive nanoparticles. In order to accurately model this process, sophisticated computer models must be developed through collaborative research at the interface of electrical and computer engineering, applied physics, and mechanical engineering. A predictive computational tool resulting from this research would lead to radically improved concurrent engineering where chip designers are enabled to create bolder designs since they would be aware of the ramifications of CMP on their layouts. The resulting impact would be more sophisticated computer chip designs that exploit the most advanced materials which might normally be avoided due to the uncertainty of the effect of CMP on the materials. Due to the PIs on-going involvements with the recruitment and education of minority students, this work will also provide numerous opportunities to expose America?s next generation of engineering students at the pre-college and college levels to cutting-edge research in semiconductor technologies.","title":"CPA-DA: A 3D CMP-aware Nanoscale IC Design Methodology using Physics-based Modeling with Silicon Validation via Test and Diagnosis","awardID":"0811770","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2013-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7945","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYST"}}],"PIcoPI":["469456","548338"],"PO":["562984"]},"139368":{"abstract":"Project ID: 0811023<br\/>Title: A Statistical Regression Framework for Large-Scale Modeling and Optimization of Mixed-Signal Nano Circuits<br\/>PI: Xin Li<br\/>Instt : Carnegie Mellon University<br\/><br\/><br\/>ABSTRACT<br\/>The proposed project aims to automatically synthesize robust high-performance circuits built upon unreliable nano devices and, eventually, to facilitate a bold move from silicon-chip towards nano-chip.

Compared to the traditional least-squares fitting, STAR is expected to achieve 100~1000?e runtime speedup, thereby offering a fundamental infrastructure that enables large-scale statistical modeling and optimization.

Furthermore, the proposed statistical regression addresses a unique mathematical problem, and it would have fundamental impacts on applied statistics and machine learning. Finally, given the broad coverage over multiple science and engineering fields such as statistical learning, nonlinear optimization, nano electronics, etc., the proposed project offers an excellent opportunity to train the young generation of American researchers.

This choice is due to lower cost and greater leakage savings of coarse-grain power gating compared to its fine-grain counterpart, which inserts the header or footer in each standard cell in the ASIC design library. The project results are expected to include the following: (i) Distributed sleep transistor placement and sizing; (ii) Sleep signal scheduling to minimize the peak current demand on wakeup; (iii) Mode transition energy minimization to enable more frequent mode transitions; (iv) Local sleep signal generation for autonomous power gating; and (v) Power gating to enable multiple power modes.

Even before one new device technology goes into mass manufacturing, scientists start working on next generation technologies. Unfortunately, the ability to control the processing environment nears its natural limits. One direct result of this diminishing process control capability is the increasing variability in component parameters. The performance of analog electronic circuits is especially susceptible to such process variations. As the control over the process diminishes, testing the manufactured parts effectively and efficiently becomes increasingly more important. The testing process becomes all the more essential to ensure product quality and eventual success of the products in the global marketplace. The conflict resulting from the push towards higher performance while the process variability is increasing indicates a dire need for new approaches for the test automation of analog circuits that will be eventually adopted by the industry. <br\/>The goal of this project is to develop hierarchical methods for process variability analysis that are geared towards test and diagnosis automation. By determining the variance of each intermediate parameter for the fault-free circuit and for many distinct faults, efficient fault-based test and diagnosis approaches can be developed. During fault injection, only a subset of the system building blocks will change. Through the hierarchical analysis approach, the changes in the circuit will prompt reprocessing of only the information that needs to be updated to ensure efficiency. While digital fault-based test and diagnosis methods have enjoyed widespread acceptance from the industry, there has been a resistance in the analog domain mostly due to the discrepancy between the design goals and the definition of what constitutes a fault. With the help of efficient process variability analysis, this project aims at breaking through this barrier by disassociating the fault injection from the pass\/fail criteria. Aligning the pass\/fail criteria with the specifications of the circuit will initiate a wider acceptance of automated fault-based test and diagnosis in the analog domain.","title":"Collaborative Research:Hierarchical Testing and Yield Enhancement of High End Integrated RF Systems","awardID":"0917738","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2009-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["525702"],"PO":["562984"]},"143120":{"abstract":"This project focuses on problems in computational complexity theory, with the goal of clarifying the power and limitations of various important classes of algorithms (known as ``complexity classes'').

The goals of this research program are (1) to design and understand the limits of data structures that represent various types of metric spaces, and (2) to analyze and understand self-adjusting (aka self-organizing) data structures.

Perhaps the most important class of metrics today are those that correspond to distance (or latency or monetary cost) in networks, such as computer networks, road networks, or social networks. All networks with some physical basis in reality are prone to congestion and spontaneous failure, whether due to benign causes or coordinated sabotage.

The desired outcome is a cohesive approach that improves chip lifetimes via both better estimation at design time (leading to reduced design margining, and therefore design times and costs) and circuit-based techniques that enable post-fabrication monitoring and improvement of robustness during the lifetime of a given die. The key components of this work include: 1) a tool that statistically determines expected chip-level reliability, 2) a theoretically rigorous approach that uses a small number of post-silicon measurements on a wafer to improve the reliability\/performance characteristics of a larger set of chips, 3) new ultra-compact on-chip sensors to monitor reliability mechanisms with low overhead and compatibility with modern design methodologies, 4) a novel indirect measurement scheme based on the quiescent current draw of a chip to monitor for wearout, 5) design styles to combat very high intrinsic failure rates (e.g., 1 in 1000 devices fail). <br\/><br\/>The proposed strategy to improve reliability in highly variable nanoscale CMOS will facilitate sustained improvement in the performance and robustness of integrated circuits - a necessary condition for the continued evolution of semiconductor and information technology.

In other words, ad hoc networking allows an arbitrary collection of MNs to create a network on demand. There are numerous scenarios that do not have an available network infrastructure and could benefit from the creation of an ad hoc network: rescue\/emergency operations, law enforcement activities, and tactical missions.<br\/><br\/>Research in the mobile ad hoc networking (MANET) field typically uses simulation in order to imitate the appearance or character of the MANET being studied; indeed, most of what is known about MANETs has been discovered through simulation. A simulation study involves several steps, each of which must be carried out properly in order to obtain reliable results. Unfortunately, much of the MANET simulation research that has been done is seriously flawed. In many cases, simulation scenarios provide environments that are not rigorous enough to provide meaningful results; in some other cases, the environments provide more stress than is desirable. As a result, published MANET simulation studies generally lack credibility. <br\/><br\/>The purpose of this project is to enhance the credibility of MANET simulations. <br\/>The intellectual merit of this work is to develop tools and methods for the MANET research community that will improve the credibility of simulation-based studies.

Techniques for improving performance (e.g., moving non-sequential content to flash, use of flash as a write buffer) will be investigated. The investigators will explore how flash can facilitate improved service differentiation by reducing the variance of access times inherent in the operation of disks. Finally, the the feasibility of selected replication of popular content on disk and flash and diverting more IO traffic to flash during periods of thermal emergencies will be<br\/>investigated. Power savings resulting from opportunities to slow down disks, without compromising performance, will also be explored. The investigators will implement a Linux-based prototype Direct-Attached Storage HybridStore system that will manage a hard disk drive and a SATA-enabled flash drive attached to the shared IO bus.

This research will study and recommend design elements essential for architecture and governance structures that promote interorganizational success in using these systems. This project will draw on relevant knowledge from public administration, organizational theory, and information systems. It will focus on: (1) the design of collaborative systems that explicitly address the organizational needs of the technical infrastructure and (2) interactions among the system design elements and participating organizations that can best leverage such systems. Public safety collaborations currently use either packaged or open-standards systems to support interoperability among police, fire, rescue, homeland security and other public safety agencies. Examples of the packaged software systems include those from COPLINK and Motorola. Examples of open standards systems include Pennsylvania's Justice Network (JNET), the D.C. area's Capitol Wireless Integrated Network (CapWIN) and the San Diego area's Automated Regional Justice Information System (ARJIS). The current proposal will expand upon initial empirical and theoretical work conducted by its investigators based on CapWIN, ARJIS and JNET, and other interorganizational collaborative settings.<br\/><br\/>Expected contributions:<br\/>The researchers identify three key reasons to focus on infrastructures for interorganizational collaboration in the public safety domain. First, such systems are exemplars of how future networked organizations that exist because of IT, and effectively use it, might look. Second, they represent some of the most innovative thinking in digital government. Third, these systems, in their design and use, have direct benefits relative to public safety. These include improved homeland security, better delivery of governmental service and safer communities, while they impart substantial scientific value relative to design principles for both collaborative systems and the organizations using them. In furthering such research, the United States will provide leadership addressing current challenges that national and international public safety organizations face. The project will employ a design-centered approach in order to achieve improved and more robust IT infrastructures to support interorganizational information sharing. It will combine detailed empirical investigation using several field-based data collection methods, and will analyze extensive secondary data available on public safety in the United States. It will synthesize existing literature across a range of relevant disciplines to support theoretical and practical design recommendations for collaborative IT infrastructure and supportive organizational governance principles and structures.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit of the work derives from:<br\/>1.

(the growing disparity between the performance offered by sequential processors and the scaling expections set by Moore?s law.) Two- and four-core multicores are commonplace today, with scaling to thousands of cores expected by the middle of the next decade. Unfortunately, because even two- and four-core multicores (let alone thousand-core multicores) are extremely hard to program, the widespread acceptance of multicore architectures is threatened. The multicore programming challenge is a serious issue that requires us to think about bold new approaches to architecture, programming, and software.<br\/><br\/>The ATAC project is based on one simple idea: that a low-latency, low-energy broadcast mechanism from any core to all other cores can yield a big step forward in multicore programmability. The broadcast mechanism is enabled by a novel CMOS-integrated chip-level optical interconnection using WDM (wave-division multiplexing) with multiple add\/drop points. The optical interconnect augments a traditional electrical-mesh interconnect in a tiled multicore processor. Although point-to-point electrical interconnect is capable of delivering performance that is competitive with on-chip optical interconnect, it does not solve the programmability issue. Thus, in ATAC, the optical broadcast capability does not replace basic electrical interconnect, it simply augments it for programmability. Accordingly, to drastically ease programming for multicores, this project will design the ATAC computer architecture that augments an on-chip mesh network with an on-chip optical broadcast network. Such a network enables blazingly fast broadcast communication that will allow programmers to take full advantage of the multicore opportunity, even as multicores scale to thousands of cores. One way it can accomplish this is by enabling novel, distributed coherent-shared-memory architectures that provide efficient support for current programming models. Although this broadcast capability has the potential to greatly speed-up existing algorithms, its greatest appeal lies in its ability to facilitate new, easy-to-use programming models. Therefore, this project will also develop programming models and APIs (application programming interfaces) facilitated by a cheap broadcast, and evaluate the resulting impact on both performance and programming ease. The ATAC project will collaborate with UCSD's Arsenal project, which is developing massively heterogeneous multicores that drive the demand for efficient on-chip interconnects.","title":"CPA-CSA-T: ATAC: Enhancing Multicore Programmability through All-to-All Computing","awardID":"0811724","effectiveDate":"2008-08-01","expirationDate":"2012-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}}],"PIcoPI":["467768",370903,"382922"],"PO":["366560"]},"139655":{"abstract":"The use of robotic systems in remote and\/or hazardous environments requires fundamental advances in software to guarantee that such systems will perform safely and reliably, even when component failures are inevitable.

The design of such failure tolerant robotic systems relies on the proper incorporation of redundancy, and its intelligent control. The criteria of operation include: (a) failures must be anticipated, (b) performance must gracefully degrade in response to component failures and (c) behavior must be failsafe in the presence of catastrophic failures.

Static media and current computational approaches are not up to the task of capturing highly complex visually based tacit knowledge. A visual knowledge infrastructure based on enhanced computational approaches and robust tools must be developed that can harness the extant wealth of visual-knowledge expertise<br\/>and will facilitate the rapid and effective transfer of that knowledge to and use by learners. Five necessary computer science research goals must be reached in order to build such a visual knowledge infrastructure. They include the development of a declarative knowledge module for visual and textual content management, visual mining algorithms for discovering associations in a multi-dimensional feature space, a cognitive model for visual media analysts, a case-based reasoning system for knowledge repositories and acquisition, and a digital library with a robust knowledge exchange framework for interdisciplinary communities. The cognitive model of visual media analysts proposed in the project has the ability to index facts and production rules from associations among low-level visual features and high-level semantics. To make the machine-readable visual knowledge accessible and sharable by novices, the proposed case-based reasoning system will provide the functions for knowledge retrieval. An efficient visual-knowledge infrastructure is necessary to meet the needs of high quality and cost-effective basic science research and health care.
