{"198110":{"abstract":"Big-data practice suggests that there is a tradeoff between the speed of data ingestion, the ability to answer queries quickly (e.g., via indexing), and the freshness of data. This perceived tradeoff lies, for example, at the heart of the historic division between OLTP (online transaction processing) and OLAP (online analytical processing). In an OLTP database, data gets ingested quickly and the data available for querying is fresh, but analytical queries run prohibitively slowly. In an OLAP data warehouse, data is buffered for off-line indexing so that analytical queries run quickly, but by the time the data gets indexed, it is stale. <br\/><br\/>This tradeoff has manifestations in the design of all types of storage systems. For example, some file-systems are optimized for reads and others for writes, but workloads generally involve a mixture of reads and writes. <br\/><br\/>In this project the PIs show that this is not a fundamental tradeoff, but rather a tradeoff imposed by the choice of data structure. The PIs use write-optimized structures, an alternative to traditional indexing methodologies, to build storage systems in which this tradeoff is significantly mitigated or alleviated altogether. The performance promise of such indexing schemes follows from the PIs previous work establishing that write-optimized data structures can speed up both inserts and queries. <br\/><br\/>This project addresses the remaining obstacles in the deployment of write-optimized indexes within big-data file-systems and databases. Big data imposes a new set of constraints on any storage system, and the PIs will show how write-optimized indexing can yield order-of-magnitude performance improvements at scale. In particular, this project will show that such techniques are not only applicable today but that they will scale with hardware trends, including the widespread adoption of solid-state disks (SSDs).","title":"BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DCM: Collaborative Research: Eliminating the Data Ingestion Bottleneck in Big Data Applications","awardID":"1247726","effectiveDate":"2013-02-01","expirationDate":"2017-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8083","name":"Big Data Science &Engineering"}}],"PIcoPI":["533341","510424"],"PO":["565251"]},"209605":{"abstract":"The University of California, Berkeley and the University of North Carolina, Charlotte propose a collaborative effort?called FRABJOUS?to develop and deploy a proposed, new Advanced Placement (AP) computing course that can successfully achieve outreach ? attracting women and underrepresented minorities ? while having a technically rigorous programming component.

Engineered systems such as these are deterministic, with well-defined states and parameters of normal operation which allow control teams to achieve their goals through direct interaction with ICT. But when the focus is a natural (i.e., social or living) system rather than a machine, the control task imposes quite different cognitive demands which make the design, development, and integration of ICT more challenging. High-risk, fast-response medicine is an example of a work environment that deals with a natural system (the patient), where the need for effective ICT support is as high as for engineered systems. The goal of this research is to develop innovative approaches for real-time information presentation to support situation awareness and collaborative work by fast-response, interdisciplinary medical teams. In particular, the PI will examine how context-specific information should be presented to support such teamwork while accounting for team members' perceptual and cognitive limitations. To this end, she will focus on the team-dependent and information-intensive processes of evaluating critically ill patients in the high-risk medical domains of pediatric trauma and emergency resuscitation. The research will involve field studies, video review of medical events, design and development of display prototypes, and evaluation. Project outcomes will include conceptual and empirical understanding of awareness in fast-response medical teamwork, approaches for augmenting distributed cognition through interactive displays, lessons from the development of display prototypes for improving awareness of rapidly unfolding events and their progression, and lessons from evaluating such prototypes in real-world settings.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The research will contribute to and inform diverse scientific fields, including information presentation in dynamic environments that rely on interactive information presentation, human-computer interaction where work conditions limit direct interaction with information systems, and the automatic capture and integration of data arriving from multiple sources.

This approach will build on the recently introduced coordination paradigm within network information theory, which looks at multiterminal problems in terms of optimal use of communication resources in order to establish some desired statistical correlations between the nodes of a network. The main theoretical goal is to explicitly identify the effect of bandwidth limitations, losses, delays, and lack of central coordination on the performance of statistical learning algorithms over networks. The project will systematically explore the fundamental limits of learning in multiterminal settings and design efficiently implementable and robust coding\/decoding schemes.

Statistical machine learning is emerging as a dominant paradigm for making accurate predictions on the basis of empirical observations in the presence of significant model uncertainty. Most of the research activity in this field, however, has taken place in isolation from the realities of complex networks and all the attendant limitations on information transmission and processing: it is frequently assumed that the data needed for learning are available instantly, with arbitrary precision, and at a single location. However, given the fact that most data fed to machine learning algorithms are increasingly generated, exchanged, stored and processed over large-scale networks, there is a pressing need to dispense with this assumption and thus take network effects into consideration. The theory and the algorithms developed as part of this project will ensure that the relevant data are delivered over the network to the right decision-makers, while securing accurate decisions made on the basis of the received information. The research component of the project is tightly integrated with an education and outreach plan, including development and teaching of new courses on machine learning aimed specifically at engineering students.","title":"CAREER: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Communication-Constrained Statistical Learning","awardID":"1254041","effectiveDate":"2013-02-01","expirationDate":"2018-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7935","name":"COMM & INFORMATION THEORY"}}],"PIcoPI":["541985"],"PO":["564924"]},"206999":{"abstract":"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) translate signals recorded from the brain into useful outputs such as control of the movement of a computer cursor, selection of letters or icons on a computer screen, or even operation of a neuroprosthesis.

All attendees commit to the entire meeting, from the opening reception and dinner on the evening of Monday, June 3, through the final summary discussion at breakfast the morning of Friday, June 7. The schedule for the days in between includes, on Tuesday morning, brief summaries scientific and technical advances by representatives of selected BCI labs. Tuesday afternoon includes innovative applications and protocols for BCIs, as well as a panel on BCI performance metrics. Wednesday starts with a special breakfast for women in the BCI field, and continues with a session on Clinical Translation and Dissemination. After a poster and demo session, there will be a Town Hall meeting focused on forming a BCI Society. On Thursday up to 15 workshops proposed by researchers in the BCI field will run concurrently, each workshop to combine invited talks, targeted discussion, and sharply focused debates. Thursday's sessions will conclude with a discussion of the State of the Art and future workshops for BCI technologies. On Friday morning there will be a plenary session of all meeting attendees, in which leaders of each workshop will present a 15-minute summary presentation. The primary source of funding for the meeting will once again be the National Institutes of Health. NSF funds will enable the conference organizers to support about 30 additional students (including undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows), to attend and participate in a special pre-conference seminar as well as the conference itself. More information about the conference may be found online at http:\/\/bcimeeting.org\/2013\/.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Students will be encouraged to participate in all aspects of the conference. The laboratory research reports of the first day will expose them to the breadth and variety of BCI research going on around the world. The informal workshops will familiarize them with the issues now being addressed on the cutting edge of the research and with the different viewpoints on those issues. Students will assist in workshop planning; participate in the workshop discussions; and may assist in the preparation of summary reports. In preparation for the main meeting, a special colloquium will be held for students on the afternoon of June 3 with the purpose of presenting a big picture, as well as filling in gaps in their understanding before they move into specialized sessions on various aspects of the field. On Monday and Wednesday afternoons, students will attend special \"talk back\" sessions where established researchers will be available to answer questions and to lead discussions. Students and post-doctoral fellows will present posters on their research, which will be judged by a panel of senior BCI researchers on the basis of innovation and scientific or technical merit. With all participants housed on site and all meals for all attendees taken together on site, there will be ample opportunity for informal discussions. This creates a unique opportunity for students and trainees to mingle with and learn from established researchers. Student participation is a critical feature of the BCI meetings, allowing students to meet potential mentors and collaborators. Many students who attended the first four BCI meetings have gone on to pursue BCI as their chosen field of research. The PI will make a special effort to encourage participation by members of traditionally underrepresented groups.","title":"Student Support for the Fifth International Brain-Computer Interface Meeting","awardID":"1331208","effectiveDate":"2013-02-15","expirationDate":"2014-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[554219],"PO":["565227"]},"199266":{"abstract":"This research project addresses the fundamental question of how we can use the existing ecosystem of networked devices in our surroundings to make sense of and exploit massive, heterogeneous, and multi-scale data anywhere and at any time. Assembling these devices into unified sensemaking environments would enable deep analysis in the field. Examples include managing heterogeneous data in scientific lab notebooks, scaffolding undergraduate classroom learning with examples, manuals, and videos, and supporting police investigation by linking facts, findings, and evidence. On a higher level, this concept would stimulate our digital economy by supporting fields such as design and creativity, command and control, and scientific discovery. However, despite this ready access to a myriad of handheld devices as well as those integrated in our physical environments, each individual device is currently designed to be the focus of attention, cannot easily be combined with other devices to improve productivity, and has limited computational and storage resources. This project introduces a comprehensive new approach called ubiquitous analytics (ubilytics) for harnessing these ever-present digital devices into unified environments for anywhere analysis and sensemaking of data.<br\/><br\/>Ubilytics draws on human-computer interaction, visual analytics, and ubiquitous computing as well as a synthesis of distributed, extended, and embodied cognition, based on three principles. First, universal interaction requires designing an interaction model that combines several devices into a holistic distributed interface, transparently bridges multiple devices, surfaces, and even physical objects, and unifies interaction with various data types. Second, flexible visual structures must be created in order to generate representations that adapt to varying device dimensions, resolution, viewing angle, and distance, support space and layout management in ego-centric and world-centric configurations, and can utilize both novel and appropriated displays for output. Third, efficient distributed architecture must be achieved through methods for discovering, merging, and synchronizing heterogeneous devices with support for a generic component model to facilitate reuse, offloading costly computation into the cloud, and meshing ubilytics environments for collaboration. <br\/><br\/>Sensemaking is often attributed to professional analysts finding meaning from observed data, but this research will take a comprehensive view of sensemaking for both casual and expert users, in both dedicated and mobile settings, and with both large-scale and small-scale datasets. This work will therefore benefit society by focusing on three example domains: (1) scientific discovery, (2) classroom learning, and (3) police investigation. It will also advance discovery and understanding by integrating the research in an undergraduate programming course used as a testbed for learning in ubilytics environments. Another goal is to broaden participation of underrepresented groups by engaging in a women in engineering program as well as by mentoring minority undergraduate students during summer research internships.

In fact, the fluid dynamics of large, open bodies of water can be quite complex and this proposal addresses large coherent structures that naturally occur in the flow structure of these large bodies of water. The goals of this project are to extend the PI's ONR YIP award into the realm of 3-D, expanding the mathematical and control framework for distributed autonomous sensing and tracking of geophysical fluid dynamics and to understand the long-term impact of geophysical fluid dynamics to improve the autonomy of underwater vehicles. The key idea exploits the capability of the team to cover large regions to increase the spatio-temporal sampling resolution of the flow field. The data will then be processed in a distributed fashion to obtain a global description of the flow dynamics that can be maintained and updated in real-time. The specific objectives that expand prior proposals include not only the 3-D modeling, but the development of an energy efficient stochastic pulse controller for tracking the ridges of the coherent structures and expanding the estimation of the structures through stochastic approaches that allow the fusing of larger teams of sensing entities. The intellectual merit of the proposed work stems from the synthesis of nonlinear dynamical systems theory, transport theory, and robotics to develop a modeling, control, and analysis framework for collaborative unmanned systems operating in dynamic and uncertain environments. The information gleaned from the coherent structures will be used to refine motion control and resource allocation strategies to determine minimum-effort stochastic control policies for long-term operation in GFD environments. To the PI's knowledge, this is the first attempt to use robots to track and map unstable coherent structures in the ocean, and to exploit knowledge of them to improve the autonomy of AUVs\/ASVs.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: Success of these endeavors will improve the forecast of weather-climate systems, underwater transport dynamics, and the modeling and prediction of various other physical phenomena in geophysical flow environments. Since the proposed methods are very general and developed for continued operation in dynamic and uncertain environments, success of the proposed activities will likely increase the maneuverability and energy-efficiency of existing AUVs\/ASVs; enable teams of AUVs\/ASVs to continuously adapt to changing environmental conditions as they execute their assigned tasks; and provide greater situational awareness for various scientific, commercial, and military applications in the ocean. In addition, the proposed educational activities include a comprehensive plan to integrate the study of GFD into robotics through online educational modules for general K-12 audiences; an interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate curriculum; and contributions to the robotics community in the form of open source software and hardware development tools.","title":"CAREER: A New Paradigm in Control and Coordination of Robot Teams in Geophysical Flows","awardID":"1253917","effectiveDate":"2013-02-01","expirationDate":"2018-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["551322"],"PO":["564069"]},"199167":{"abstract":"Achieving a high fraction of peak performance on complex architectures has been a perennial challenge for application developers.

This platform, and the data sets generated with it will serve the broader research and education communities in computer science and MAS.<br\/><br\/>Research on robust methods for strategic reasoning has the potential to significantly improve decision making in many important real-world problems, including decision support tools for homeland security operations.

High-speed, ubiquitous wireless access is increasingly an enabling technology for important applications ranging from communication to commerce, medicine, and education. It is thus critical to create a pathway for sustainable wireless network growth in terms of the number of users and their data rates. A major challenge facing this effort is interference: since the wireless channel is a shared medium, simultaneous transmissions interfere with one another. This phenomenon is conventionally viewed as harmful by theorists and practitioners alike, and modern wireless protocols are designed to avoid interference. Within this paradigm, the wireless channel is a fixed resource with a finite capacity, meaning that as more users join a network, the maximum data rate per user plummets. However, interfering signals are not just additional noise; rather, they represent data from other users and possess considerable structure which can be exploited.<br\/><br\/>This research pursues a novel approach to multi-user communication based on harnessing the algebraic structure of interference. The key insight is that it is possible for a receiver to first decode linear combinations of all transmitted codewords and only afterwards solve for its desired codeword in the digital domain. In many important network scenarios, this powerful technique yields significantly higher data rates compared to conventional approaches. This project leverages this technique to uncover the fundamental capacity limits of canonical wireless networks subject to interference as well as establish architectural principles for coding strategies that can efficiently approach these limits. It draws upon modern tools from combinatorial optimization to solve the resource allocation problems that emerge when this technique is applied to complex wireless networks, such as distributed multiple antenna systems. More broadly, this research lays the foundation for an algebraic network information theory to tackle challenging problems in decentralized information processing, compression, and decoding. This project incorporates several outreach efforts including interactive presentations on cellular communication for high school students, tutorials, and workshop organization.","title":"CAREER: Harnessing Interference Structure in Networks","awardID":"1253918","effectiveDate":"2013-02-01","expirationDate":"2018-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7935","name":"COMM & INFORMATION THEORY"}}],"PIcoPI":["550997"],"PO":["564924"]},"201445":{"abstract":"This project focuses on the fundamental tradeoff between spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency in cognitive radio systems by exploring the correlations across both spectrum and energy domains, in the notions of both frequency holes and energy holes.

This perceived tradeoff lies, for example, at the heart of the historic division between OLTP (online transaction processing) and OLAP (online analytical processing). In an OLTP database, data gets ingested quickly and the data available for querying is fresh, but analytical queries run prohibitively slowly. In an OLAP data warehouse, data is buffered for off-line indexing so that analytical queries run quickly, but by the time the data gets indexed, it is stale. <br\/><br\/>This tradeoff has manifestations in the design of all types of storage systems. For example, some file-systems are optimized for reads and others for writes, but workloads generally involve a mixture of reads and writes. <br\/><br\/>In this project the PIs show that this is not a fundamental tradeoff, but rather a tradeoff imposed by the choice of data structure. The PIs use write-optimized structures, an alternative to traditional indexing methodologies, to build storage systems in which this tradeoff is significantly mitigated or alleviated altogether. The performance promise of such indexing schemes follows from the PIs previous work establishing that write-optimized data structures can speed up both inserts and queries.<br\/><br\/>This project addresses the remaining obstacles in the deployment of write-optimized indexes within big-data file-systems and databases. Big data imposes a new set of constraints on any storage system, and the PIs will show how write-optimized indexing can yield order-of-magnitude performance improvements at scale. In particular, this project will show that such techniques are not only applicable today but that they will scale with hardware trends, including the widespread adoption of solid-state disks (SSDs).","title":"BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DCM: Collaborative Research: Eliminating the Data Ingestion Bottleneck in Big-Data Applications","awardID":"1247750","effectiveDate":"2013-02-01","expirationDate":"2017-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8083","name":"Big Data Science &Engineering"}}],"PIcoPI":[531670],"PO":["565251"]},"199147":{"abstract":"Unprecedented technological progress in the last decades makes information theory an ever more exciting and important discipline.

Unfortunately, when such systems have safety-critical components, multicore platforms are rarely used.

With current technology, very conservative estimates concerning the usage of these shared resources must be made, to certify that overuse violations do not occur at runtime. The resulting over-provisioning can be significant, easily negating the processing power of any additional cores.

In particular, she aims to create feminist theory for HCI , which she hopes will close the gap in women's participation in computing. Previously, the PI has shown how approaches to designing for women are questionable when viewed in light of feminist theory. Feminist scholars argue that the lack of women in computing further discourages women from pursuing programming-related careers, and that women are also excluded because technologies created by men better address male needs. The PI believes the problem lies not only in who is excluded but in that the design processes inherently alienate women. Her approach is to address the problem by bridging previously unrelated aspects of the learning sciences, human-computer interaction, and the science and technology studies of gender, which will be combined with findings from a multi-year ethnographic study to acquire a deep understanding of how girls co-construct their gender and technical identities, how technologies come to be associated with one gender or the other, and how this affects girls' career choices. These results will be used as the basis for participatory design with the girls to create technologies in keeping with their gender identity. In doing so the PI expects to learn about girls' needs, enabling her to develop best practices for gender-sensitive design ensuring equitable access to technology. By bridging previously unconnected literatures, the project will reframe the problem of gender-equity in computer science from a pipeline issue to one requiring improved design and evaluation practices in HCI. The multi-year ethnographic study, to be conducted both in school and at after school programs, will provide a longitudinal understanding of how young women co-construct their gender and technical identities, what appeals to them about technical careers, and the process by which technology artifacts acquire symbolic gender. Participatory design will allow theory to be applied to understand what appeals to girls in the technology design process.

The project will create grounded theory on gender and technical identity that will inform participatory design, which in turn will allow the identification of needed changes to the software development process so that it results in more technologies that empower young women to use technology. As a consequence, the pool of qualified computer scientists will ultimately expand to include more women, which in the long turn will increase workforce thereby making the United States more globally competitive in business and more able to pursue scientific national security efforts. Furthermore, the project will directly benefit the group of young women involved in the ethnographic study, increasing their practical experiences with technology by teaching them software design, HCI, programming skills, and a foundation in computational thinking. Through participatory design the project will also expose middle and high school teachers to ubiquitous computing technologies, providing teacher development.","title":"CAREER: Towards HCI Theory for Technical and Gender Identity","awardID":"1253465","effectiveDate":"2013-02-01","expirationDate":"2018-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[534324],"PO":["565227"]},"201459":{"abstract":"In order to apply emerging technologies (e.g. dynamic spectrum sharing) to address the wireless spectrum shortage problem, there is a critical need to understand global RF spectrum usage trends.

The spectrum observatories use a common platform generating a single RF spectrum measurement dataset. 2) Development of empirically validated, statistical models of spectrum utilization for different wireless application types based on this dataset. 3) Use of \"big data\" analytical techniques to mine the dataset to discover temporal and spectral correlations not obvious using traditional approaches.

Modern radio systems often use multiple transmit antennas and appropriate signal coding to improve throughput and reliability of wireless links. Ideally, each amplifier should be rated at the maximum total (or sum) power that can be transmitted from all antennas. Due to cost and efficiency considerations, the power rating is usually designed to be lower (typically the maximum total power divided by the number of antennas), and this can lead to significant performance loss. This research explores a solution using Power Combining Networks (PCN) that enable the output of an amplifier to be switched\/combined into any antenna, thus moving power from a weaker to a stronger antenna, resulting in improved link performance.<br\/><br\/>The maximum output power of a MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output) antenna transmitter is limited due to bio-safety considerations. MIMO transmission performs best when each power amplifier is rated at the full system transmit power. If the amplifiers are fractionally rated due to cost and efficiency considerations, the worst case loss with M antennas can reach log M dB in the presence of channel imbalances. A PCN can reduce this loss significantly, trading the loss of array gain for a better channel coupling efficiency. Use of a PCN alters the effective MIMO channel and therefore can also change the optimum transmit coding. The goal of this research is to study fast algorithms for PCN selection, appropriate signal coding schemes and the best realizable performance.","title":"Power Combining Networks for MIMO Transmission","awardID":"1256548","effectiveDate":"2013-02-01","expirationDate":"2015-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7936","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING"}}],"PIcoPI":["553691",535565],"PO":["564898"]},"198149":{"abstract":"The objective of this project is to enable more efficient and reliable operation of autonomous femtocell networks with agile spectrum access, autonomous interference control, as well as intelligent network self-organization and self-optimization.

Unfortunately, when such systems have safety-critical components, multicore platforms are rarely used. The reason is a lack of predictability associated with hardware components such as caches, memory controllers, etc., that are shared among cores. With current technology, very conservative estimates concerning the usage of these shared resources must be made, to certify that overuse violations do not occur at runtime. The resulting over-provisioning can be significant, easily negating the processing power of any additional cores. The goal of this project is to resolve this multicore \"predictability problem\" by developing allocation mechanisms that enable shared hardware resources to be controlled in a predictable way. The research agenda in this project includes fundamental research on relevant real-time resource allocation problems, prototyping efforts involving real-time operating systems and middleware, and experimental evaluations of improvements enabled by the developed mechanisms in timing analysis tools (which are used to determine task execution-time budgets).<br\/><br\/>Addressing the \"predictability problem\" associated with multicore platforms would be a breakthrough result for safety-critical, cyber-physical systems in domains such as avionics and automobiles. When using multicore platforms to host highly-critical workloads in these domains, the current state of the art is to obviate the predictability problem by turning off all but one core. Unless a more intelligent solution can be found, such domains will not benefit from savings in size, weight, and power (SWaP) and gains in functionality that multicore platforms afford.

As some of these challenges may be hard and have no computationally feasible solutions, instead of focusing on a fixed evolutionary model and attempting to fit biological problems into it, the PI will let the model be flexible and problem-driven. In the course of PRUGC development, the PI plans to address the following particularly important biological problems (listed in the order of growing complexity): the primate-rodent-carnivore split controversy in mammalian evolution (featuring relatively small number of duplications); phylogenetic analysis of a diverse variety of yeast genomes including genomes that undergone whole genome duplications; and evolutionary problems in plant evolution rich in segmental duplications. Solutions to these problems will help to better understand the mechanisms behind chromosome evolution across variety of genomes. The reconstructed ancestral genomes will provide insights to functional significance of particular gene orders, help to rigorously estimate the rate of genome rearrangements and gene duplications\/deletions in different organisms, and allow testing hypotheses about their mechanisms and influence on shaping genomic architectures. It is important to emphasize that the PRUGC software will have a wide range of applications, not limited to the aforementioned problems.

This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in geographic regions with linguistic boundaries or where there are large immigrant groups. Various levels of language (phonological, morphological, syntactic, semantic and discourse-pragmatic) may be implicated in LCS in different language pairs and\/or genres. Computational algorithms trained for a single language quickly break down when the input includes LCS. A major barrier to research on LCS in computational linguistics (CL) has been the lack of large, accurately annotated corpora of LCS data. In this project, a large repository of LCS data is collected and a large annotation infrastructure is developed. It is consistently annotated in different modalities (speech and text), at various levels of linguistic granularity, and across different language pairs reflecting different linguistic typologies (Standard Arabic and Dialectal Arabic, Arabic-English, Spanish-English, Chinese-English, Hindi-English). The focus of the effort is on intra-sentential LCS.<br\/><br\/>This infrastructure and unified large LCS data resource is eagerly awaited by the CL research community, since annotated LCS data provides a natural test-bed for adaptive learning algorithms and the handling of diverse data sources, as well as a framework for genuine multilingual processing. It will also be of benefit to sociolinguistic and theoretical linguistic researchers, and provide a platform for collaborative interdisciplinary research. Finally, research on LCS helps overcome biases against multilingual speakers by demonstrating the creativity of such speakers in exploiting their verbal repertoires. Such a result is particularly important for K-12 education and testing policies in the USA with its diverse immigrant population.","title":"CI-ADDO-NEW: Collaborative Research: A Repository for Annotating Multilingual Code Switched Data","awardID":"1343530","effectiveDate":"2013-02-01","expirationDate":"2015-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7359","name":"COMPUTING RES INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":[560340],"PO":["565215"]},"204580":{"abstract":"This is funding to provide financial support for 10 graduate students (at least 8 of them registered at U.S. universities and working towards either their Master's degree or a Doctorate) to attend the 2013 International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI 2013), to be held March 19-22 in Santa Monica, California, as participants in a special Student Consortium (workshop), as presenters in the main conference, and as attendees at the conference for general training purposes. Sponsored by ACM, the annual IUI conferences represent the growing interest in next-generation intelligent and interactive user interfaces; they are the premier forum where researchers from academia and industry, who work at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), come together to exchange complementary insights and to present and discuss outstanding research and applications whose goal is to make the computerized world a more amenable place. Unlike traditional AI the focus is not so much on making the computer smart all by itself, but rather on making the interaction between computers and people smarter. Unlike traditional HCI, there is a focus on solutions that involve large amounts of knowledge and emerging technologies such as natural language understanding, brain computer interfaces, and gesture recognition. To this end, IUI encourages contributions not only from computer science but also from related fields such as psychology, cognitive science, computer graphics, the arts, etc. IUI 2013 will be the 16th conference in the series; topics of interest this year include: intelligent interactive interfaces, systems, and devices; ubiquitous interfaces; smart environments and tools; human-centered interfaces; mobile interfaces; multimodal interfaces; pen-based interfaces; spoken and natural language interfaces; conversational interfaces; affective and social interfaces; tangible interfaces; collaborative multi-user interfaces; adaptive interfaces; sensor-based interfaces; user modeling and interaction with novel interfaces and devices; interfaces for personalization and recommender systems; interfaces for plan-based systems; interfaces that incorporate knowledge- or agent-based approaches; help interfaces for complex tasks; example- and demonstration-based interfaces; interfaces for intelligent generation and presentation of information; intelligent authoring systems; synthesis of multimodal virtual characters and social robots; interfaces for games and entertainment; for learning-based interactions and for health informatics; empirical studies and evaluations of IUI interfaces; and new approaches to designing intelligent user interfaces. More information about the conference is available online at http:\/\/iuiconf.org\/. <br\/><br\/>The IUI 2013 Student Consortium will build on the success of the first such event last year. The heart of the Consortium will be a full-day workshop on March 19, immediately preceding the conference, and will be structured to give student trainees exposure to their new research community by giving a 20-30 presentation on their work and receiving feedback from peers and a panel of 4-5 senior researchers. Group lunch and dinner will encourage social interaction among the student cohort and informal personal interaction with the mentors. The students' work will also be featured during the main conference in a poster session, where they will gain additional experience explaining their work to others in the field. The IUI conference organizers will pay for audio-visual services, two coffee breaks, and space for accommodating attendees in the student session; no funds are requested for these items from NSF.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This funding will enable attendance at the IUI conference by students who might otherwise be unable to do so for financial reasons. It will enhance the educational experience of funded participants, by bringing them into contact with leading researchers in the field and by exposing them to the lively discussion during the course of the conference that often leads to opportunities for career advancement. The quality of the conference itself will be enhanced as well, thanks to a broadening of the base of institutions represented and increased diversity of participants. The rich exchange of ideas at IUI has previously proven to be a valuable source of ideas for future research, as well as leading to collaborative efforts; this funding will extend the opportunities for collaboration and provide intellectual stimulus to programs that have previously sent few or no representatives to this conference. The organizing committee has undertaken to proactively recruit student participants from schools that have not traditionally been well represented in the IUI community. Women, minority students, the disabled, and veterans all will be encouraged to participate.

This research improves the security of these modern consumer operating systems by providing a holistic view of data protection. In particular, this work proposes a new operating system abstraction for transparently tracking and controlling access to all data, allowing policy to determine if a reader is given the true value, a fake or modified value, or no value at all. To efficiently and practically accomplish this goal, this work combines several existing and new techniques to track and control access to data. The new abstraction provided by this work not only solves a significant problem affecting modern consumer operating systems by enabling applications to retain pervasive control over their data, but also more broadly provides a new abstraction on which a variety of new security solutions can be built.","title":"CAREER: Secure OS Views for Modern Computing Platforms","awardID":"1253346","effectiveDate":"2013-02-01","expirationDate":"2018-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"8060","name":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace"}}],"PIcoPI":[534276],"PO":["565327"]},"206211":{"abstract":"The US Ignite effort is a joint public\/private initiative with the primary goal of breaking a fundamental deadlock: there is insufficient investment in gigabit applications that can take advantage of advanced network infrastructure because such infrastructure is rare and dispersed.

The main obstacle to enabling this vision is posed by the physical nature of propagation in the human body, which is composed primarily of water, a medium through which RF electromagnetic waves do not easily propagate. This project takes a different perspective and investigates for the first time the fundamentals of ultrasonic networking in human tissues through a closed-loop combination of mathematical modeling, simulation, and experimental evaluation. The project is investigating four intertwined research tasks, i.e, (i) ultrasonic channel modeling and capacity analysis; (ii) physical\/medium access control layer solutions for ultrasonic communications; (iii) distributed and asynchronous cross-layer control and resource allocation algorithms based on stochastic modeling of ultrasonic interference; (iv) performance evaluation through a multi-scale simulator and a software-defined testbed.<br\/><br\/>The project will integrate research and education with the following core contributions: (i) establishment of a visiting scholar program with a focus on ultrasonic networking and its applications; (ii) establishment of a new graduate\/undergraduate course on acoustic\/ultrasonic networking, and development of a new textbook on this topic; (iii) a broad set of activities to reach out to underrepresented students; (iv) pursuit of technology transfer activities in this field.

Microprocessor performance has improved at a remarkable rate for many years owing to technological and microarchitectural innovations. Unfortunately technology scaling has reached an impasse in recent years. Significant challenges with the chip manufacturing process in low-nanometer dimensions are causing high variability in transistor behavior leading to lower performance, higher power consumption and higher susceptibility to errors. In general, high variability leads to larger design margins making chips less energy efficient. These technological challenges are happening at a time when the need for energy efficient computing is greatest. With the rapid proliferation of cloud-based computing and the explosion of smart mobile devices energy efficiency is now crucial to the entire range of computing markets from servers to smartphones. Achieving continued performance growth in these systems going forward requires dramatic improvements in the energy efficiency of computation.<br\/><br\/>In this work, new microarchitectural and software solutions for lowering design margins in future chips are being developed, achieving substantial energy reduction while ensuring reliable operation. These solutions employ variation-aware design across multiple layers of the computing environment including microarchitectural innovations, new firmware and operating system-based scheduling and power management solutions. New technology models that for the first time integrate multiple sources of variability are being developed for this purpose, enabling the design of variation-aware solutions. The work identifies new reliability challenges that affect supply voltage stability in chips with large numbers of compute units such as many-core and graphics processors. It develops novel process and voltage variation-aware scheduling and power management algorithms that reduce voltage instability eliminating the need for large and inefficient design margins. At the microarchitectural and firmware levels the work develops new mechanisms for dynamically reducing voltage margins by leveraging on-chip resiliency mechanisms to ensure reliable and efficient execution. These solutions are dramatically improving the energy efficiency of computation and are therefore expected to have a significant impact on the computing industry and society in general.","title":"CAREER: An Integrated Treatment of Voltage Noise and Process Variability in Many-core and GPU Systems with Microarchitectural Solutions","awardID":"1253933","effectiveDate":"2013-02-01","expirationDate":"2018-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7941","name":"COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":[534480],"PO":["366560"]},"199293":{"abstract":"This project investigates how information from social networks may be used to create efficient and cooperative large-scale distributed data sharing systems. Two of the challenges facing such systems are locating data quickly and cost-efficiently, and enforcing cooperative node behaviors. Social network-based approaches seek to build social networks into data sharing systems in order to leverage the real-world friend properties of mutual trust and common interest. Although these approaches can significantly reduce cost and complexity compared to purely technical approaches, current methods only make use of a very superficial level of social network properties, and cannot support the broad goal of enabling all nodes to share data freely and efficiently. This project addresses these shortcomings through more fully leveraging social network properties, and coordinating social network-based approaches with technical approaches. Areas of investigation include infrastructures for data searching, cooperation enhancement mechanisms, and algorithms for data server selection. <br\/><br\/>Today, a multitude of large-scale distributed systems use the Internet to deliver a variety of data -- such as software and audio\/video content -- to end users. These systems support many social, commercial, and cultural activities. Millions of dollars are spent on commercial servers to deliver this data. Peer-to-peer technology, in which user computers cooperate to share content between themselves, has potential for doing this cheaper and faster. However, wider use of peer-to-peer technology is held back by several limitations. One is that nodes may misbehave, selfishly receiving content but not contributing in return, or distributing corrupted or malicious content into the system, to be further spread by unsuspecting users. Another limitation is that locating content is difficult, due to the wide distribution of nodes and the lack of a central index. This project seeks to address these limitations by making use of information obtained from social networks. Potential benefits of the work include savings in the costs of infrastructure and energy consumption for data distribution.

HRI is a single-track, highly selective annual international conference that seeks to showcase the very best inter- and multi-disciplinary research in human-robot interaction with roots in social psychology, cognitive science, HCI, human factors, artificial intelligence, robotics, organizational behavior, anthropology and many more, and invites broad participation. The theme of HRI 2013 is \"Holistic Human-Robot Development.\" Robotic solutions are increasingly applied to real world problems such as our aging society, renewable energy, climate control, emergency response, education and exploration. These societal problems require a holistic approach to the design and development of robots that meet human needs, address technical challenges, and foster acceptance in everyday settings. More information about the conference is available online at http:\/\/humanrobotinteraction.org\/2013.<br\/><br\/>The Young Pioneers Workshop is designed to complement the conference, by providing a forum for students and recent graduates in the field of HRI to share their current research with their peers and a panel of senior researchers in a setting that is less formal and more interactive than the main conference. During the workshop, participants will talk about the important upcoming research themes in the field, encouraging the formation of collaborative relationships across disciplines and geographic boundaries. To these ends, the workshop format will include oral presentations from 2 student attendees, poster presentations from all student attendees, a hands-on breakout session with group presentations, a keynote, and a panel presentation by senior researchers who will share their expertise and insights on how to address the interdisciplinary challenge of HRI. The afternoon breakout session will involve small groups of 3-5 attendees with diverse backgrounds, working to design an integrative HRI project, thereby encouraging group participation and the cultivation of cross-disciplinary ideas. The presentation session afterward will allow each breakout group to present a summary to the entire workshop; the organizers anticipate that the discussions will continue during dinner. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This workshop will afford a unique opportunity for the best of the next generation of researchers in human-robot interaction to be exposed to and discuss current and relevant topics as they are being studied in several different research communities (including but not limited to computer science and engineering, psychology, robotics, human factors and ergonomics, and HCI). This is important for the field, because it has been recognized that transformative advances in research in this fledgling area can only come through the melding of cross-disciplinary knowledge and multinational perspectives. Participants will be encouraged to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development, to form collaborative relationships, and to generate new research questions to be addressed during the coming years. Participants will also gain leadership and service experience, as the workshop is largely student organized and student led. The PI has expressed his strong commitment to recruiting women and members from other under-represented groups. To further ensure diversity, the event organizers will consider an applicant's potential to offer a fresh perspective and point of view with respect to HRI, and no more than one applicant will be accepted from any given institution.","title":"WORKSHOP: The 2013 HRI Pioneers Workshop at the 2013 ACM\/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","awardID":"1311610","effectiveDate":"2013-02-01","expirationDate":"2014-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[546850],"PO":["565227"]},"198162":{"abstract":"The objective of this project is to enable more efficient and reliable operation of autonomous femtocell networks with agile spectrum access, autonomous interference control, as well as intelligent network self-organization and self-optimization.

With the influx of new details about the higher-level structure and dynamics of the genome, novel techniques will be required to visualize and model the full extent of genomic interactions to gain insight about genome functions. Current genome browsers are specifically aimed at viewing primary sequence information. Although supplemental information can be annotated via new tracks, representing structural hierarchies and interactions is quite difficult in these browsers, particularly across non-contiguous genomic segments. In addition, in spite of many recent efforts to measure and model the genome structure at various resolutions and detail, little work has focused on combining these models or taken advantage of the large amount of genomic and epigenomic data generated from new high-throughput approaches. To address these issues, the team has created a proof-of-concept interactive 3D viewer, Genome3D, to enable integration and visualization of genomic and epigenomic data in three dimension. Substantial development is needed to take advantage of the newest genomic technologies and to enable its integration with analysis pipelines. While enormous amount of spatial information for eukaryotic chromosomes have been generated, the size and complexity of these data require the design and development of new algorithms and methods in data integration and model construction. The goal is to develop a full-fledged, platform independent system that enables biologists to build and refine their own 3D genome models to analyze their data. <br\/><br\/>The intellectual merits of the research include: 1) Implementing a novel strategy to employ new engines with strong interactive design element to transform the prototype into a cloud-based 3D genome browser that can be used on various platforms including web browsers and tablets, making 3D structural genome information available to a broader research community. 2) Adding integrated tools that can analyze 3D features of genomes and support model building and validation. 3) Designing and providing robust set of APIs and scripting for customized data analysis. 4) Collaborating with other researchers to explore and visualize new three dimensional genome models.<br\/><br\/>There are a number of broader impacts in this research. A multi-scale three dimensional genome browser is crucial to achieve fuller understanding of genome functions and will provide a new way to teach genomics. Exploring genomes through 3D visualization will significantly advance genome research and will have a profound impact on comparative genomics and genetics. The use of new user interaction-intensive engines into scientific research tools and will encourage researchers in every area to use interactive visualization to analyze data. New algorithms to analyze models and visualize genomic information can be extended to problems of similar size in other fields and form the basis for new computational approaches. This project provides valuable interdisciplinary training experiences to undergraduate and graduate students and will attract more students to computational biology research. Results and the new browser will be disseminated through publications, workshops and tutorials and will enable customized development by providing detailed APIs and tutorials.","title":"III: Medium: Collaborative Research: Developing a 3D Browser to Explore Genomes","awardID":"1339470","effectiveDate":"2013-02-01","expirationDate":"2016-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":[558368],"PO":["565136"]},"204268":{"abstract":"This project funds travel for graduate students to participate in PerCom 2013 to be held San Diego, Californiain March 2013.

The GEC location will be held at a Madison hotel within walking distance of the university campus and the demonstration session will be held in a university facility. The GENI Project Office organizes three major GENI Engineering conferences (GECs) per year, in which the entire GENI community meets to review current status, and to decide on subsequent steps in GENI's evolution. These GECs include community-based working groups leading GENI's design and planning, and demonstrating progress with live experiments. About 250 leading researchers and Ph.D. students from diverse US institutions will gather in Madison to showcase their ideas and results. In the demo session each demo will be provided with a wired connection to the GENI infrastructure. Additionally, wireless connectivity will be available for demonstrations and participants. <br\/><br\/>The Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a virtual instrument that is rapidly emerging in prototype form across the United States. GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems, as well as emerging research into very large socio-technical systems, by providing a suite of infrastructure for 'at scale' experiments in future internets. GENI is designed to address three issues: <br\/>- Science Issues: We cannot currently understand or predict the behavior of complex,<br\/>large-scale networks.<br\/>- Society Issues: We increasingly rely on the Internet but are unsure we can trust its security, privacy or resilience.<br\/>- Innovation Issues: Substantial barriers to at-scale experimentation with new architectures, services, and technologies.<br\/>GENI addresses these issues via scale (from federation) and support for two kinds of experiments: 1) controlled and repeatable experiments, which will greatly help improve our scientific understanding of complex, large-scale networks; and 2) in-the- wild trials of experimental services that ride atop or connect to today?s Internet and that engage large numbers of human participants. The GEC conference and associated demo sessions are a key component of the integrated development process for GENI. The GECs provide integration points for GENI development, provide time for face-to-face technical discussions about engineering, and ensure that the GENI development community is fully aware of evolving system feature sets.<br\/><br\/>The GEC meeting and Demo sessions provide graduate students with both an opportunity to demonstrate and explain their work to the GENI community prior to formal publication. It is a key part of helping new graduate students understand what is being done with GENI and who amongst their peers at other institutions might be valuable resources. It also supports outreach to new community members, including the emerging US Ignite community. GENI is already being used as an instrument for research.

The key challenge in statistical privacy is that applications for data collection and analysis operate on varied kinds of data, and have diverse requirements for the information that must be kept secret, and the adversaries that they must tolerate. Thus, application domain experts, who are frequently not experts in privacy, cannot directly use an existing, general-purpose privacy definition. Instead, they must develop a new privacy definition or customize an existing one. Currently there exist no rigorous techniques to customize privacy to applications.<br\/><br\/>This project builds PROTEUS, a general-purpose toolkit for developing rigorous privacy definitions and mechanisms that can be customized to applications. The cornerstone of PROTEUS is a novel privacy framework that allows customized privacy protection by explicitly listing the secrets to be protected, enumerating the (potentially infinite set of) possible adversaries, and ensuring rigorous bounds on the information disclosed to each adversary about every secret. Novel theoretical tools in PROTEUS include methods to reason about privacy for correlated data, privacy against realistic adversaries, and techniques to express and enforce personalized privacy preferences. These tools result in practical privacy mechanisms for publishing social science survey data, social network analysis, and analysis of user-activity streams. Broader impacts of this project include developing new courses in privacy and big-data management, as well as technology transfer to the US Census.","title":"CAREER: PROTEUS: A Practical and Rigorous Toolkit for Privacy","awardID":"1253327","effectiveDate":"2013-02-01","expirationDate":"2018-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"8060","name":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace"}}],"PIcoPI":[534266],"PO":["562974"]},"199197":{"abstract":"In this project the PI will develop the science needed to enhance mobile augmented reality applications with (a) eye tracking and (b) gaze direction. Mobile augmented reality uses a hand-held device to provide a see-through view of the physical world in which an image of the physical world is superimposed with information about the things in that view. It is as if you held a piece of glass up to the world, and text appeared on that piece of glass labeling the things you see through the glass. This project will investigate how mobile eye tracking, which monitors where a person is looking while on the go, can be used to determine what objects in a visual scene a person is interested in, and thus might like to have annotated in their augmented reality view. This project will investigate how to make these scene annotations appear and disappear in a manner that is neither distracting nor obtrusive by conducting experiments that measure a person's ability to accomplish visual tasks while presented with text annotations in different sizes, transparency levels, and distances from the point-of-gaze (the point where a person is looking). The project will develop algorithms to automatically manage the density and placement of these labels to best support human tasks while avoiding the creation of distracting \"visual clutter\".<br\/><br\/>The project will also develop the science that is needed to direct a person's gaze in the physical world by means of new visualization techniques for use in mobile augmented reality systems.

This study will result in both fundamental scientific knowledge and a practical application revolving around the development of highly maneuverable unmanned aerial vehicles based on flapping-wing robots. The intelligence of birds manifests itself in the evasive talents of flocks of birds and this proposal attempts to recreate that intelligence through the challenge of applying a bird-like robot to the problem of preventing aircraft\/bird collisions near airports. According to surveys by the International Bird Strike Committee, none of the existing systems to prevent bird strikes on airfields are adequate. The reasons include habituation by birds to these systems; movement of birds to other parts of the area, or scattering of them all over the airfield; and the tendency of birds to come back when a threat has gone. The only proven lasting way of removing birds is by using live birds of prey, but real birds are too difficult to control and train. An alternative is to study and extract the behaviors and dynamics of real birds in order to develop and deploy a robotic lookalike. The objective of this proposal, motivated by the problem of keeping airfields clear of disruptive avian flocks, is to develop control and sensing strategies for bird-like flapping robots that can be deployed in swarms to fend off \"antagonists.\" This work will build upon the PI's previous work on the control of flapping-wing aircraft using limit-cycle-based central pattern generators (CPGs), and on the dynamics and control of flexible, articulated-wing aircraft.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Society as a whole stands to benefit immensely from robotic birds that can effectively prevent bird strikes, which cause airplane crashes and millions of dollars annually in damage. Furthermore, because of their high aerodynamic efficiency in forward flight, articulated-winged flapping aerial robots equipped with sensors could have tremendous value by being able to inspect hazardous areas. For the field of robotics, the proposed transformative research will make far-reaching contributions, advancing the state of the art in aerial robotics, cooperative control theory, and control of flexible robot structures. Additionally, this project's education and outreach activities will help introduce a new generation of young people, including those from underrepresented populations, to the excitement of science and engineering careers.

Two important problems in dynamic adaptation of software are (1) how to prevent failure of the software during adaptation, and (2) how to reduce disruptions in the functionalities provisioned by the software. This research will devise a novel technique for dealing with these problems by automatically determining when is the best time for making changes to a running software system. The principles emerging from this research will provide the foundation for a new method of engineering dynamically adaptive software. The results of the research will be incorporated into education, such that tomorrow's software engineers are better equipped to tackle the challenges of constructing adaptive software.

This research will develop a novel technique that solves this problem in settings where such models are either not available, difficult to build, or outdated due to the evolution of the software. The hypothesis guiding this research is that by monitoring a software system?s execution history (e.g., message exchanges, method invocations) for a sufficiently long period of time, it is possible to mine an accurate model of interactions and dependencies among the system's components. The research will demonstrate how models inferred in this way can be used to (1) ensure changes in the running software do not create inconsistencies that could jeopardize the system?s functionality, (2) control the level of disruption incurred in system?s operations due to adaptation, and (3) automatically adjust the models to changing dependencies among the potentially evolving software components.","title":"CAREER: A Mining-Based Approach for Consistent and Timely Adaptation of Component-Based Software","awardID":"1252644","effectiveDate":"2013-02-01","expirationDate":"2018-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7944","name":"SOFTWARE ENG & FORMAL METHODS"}}],"PIcoPI":[534008],"PO":["564388"]},"201464":{"abstract":"Cognitive wireless systems are a collection of wireless network entities that are able to adapt intelligently to the environment through observation, exploration and learning.
