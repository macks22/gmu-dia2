{"94748":{"abstract":"The aim of the proposed research is to develop new and adapt existing knowledge representation and reasoning schemes to represent and perform various kinds of reasoning and problem solving tasks, such as prediction, explanation, diagnosis and planning about the activities inside a cell. This project aims to focus on happenings and mechanisms such as signal transduction, protein-protein interactions and other biochemical reactions. The project's preliminary results suggest that the knowledge representation, reasoning, and problem solving approaches of Artificial Intelligence are well suited for this task. In a cell when a ligand binds to an appropriate receptor it activates the receptor which in turn triggers a series of events. In the terminology of planning and reasoning about actions, the binding of a ligand to the receptor can be thought of as an action; the conditions under which a ligand can bind to a receptor, as the executability conditions of an action in a planning domain; Similarly, the direct effects of the ligand binding to a receptor can be expressed using planning terminologies. Planning is just one of the problem solving and reasoning tasks in the context of reasoning about actions in ther cellular domain. Others include prediction (hypothetical reasoning), explanation, and diagnosis. In the context of a cell, representing the cell behavior using actions and determining the effects and side effects of a drug (that manifests as a ligand) would correspond to prediction. Similarly, figuring out what interventions will change the cell behavior in a particular way corresponds to planning; determining the cause behind some unexpected observations about the cell corresponds to diagnosis. Since research on cell decoding is ongoing this project will have only partial information about the happenings inside a cell, and its reasoning schemes will need to be able to deal with incomplete information. In this way, this project ties into important goals in AI research on knowledge representation and reasoning. Although the existing research in knowledge representation and reasoning provides a good foundation for representing and reasoning about cell behavior, there are several new features in this domain that pose new research challenges. Tackling them is the main goal of this project. Challenges to be addressed include modeling triggering activity, notions of sensitization of receptors, and protein 'recruiting' proteins.","title":"Knowledge Representation, Reasoning, and Problem Solving in a Cellular Domain","awardID":"0412000","effectiveDate":"2004-08-01","expirationDate":"2010-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1713","name":"WORKFORCE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6856","name":"ARTIFICIAL INTELL & COGNIT SCI"}}],"PIcoPI":["431233"],"PO":["491702"]},"95408":{"abstract":"The PI will develop a methodology for transforming imagery such that it is more effective. This will enable practical systems for adapting imagery created for one device such that it works effectively on others. By providing methods for retargeting images and video to new devices, the PI will enable applications to make use of the proliferating computing and communications infrastructure. For example, it will become possible to provide effective informational images to cellular phones, training videos to PDAs, and status information to \"heads up\" displays. To these ends, the PI will establish an understanding and methodology for transformations that improve the effectiveness of imagery across a range of scenarios, and tools to create this imagery. This involves developing methods for determining what is important in the source imagery, methods for altering images to emphasize the important parts, and methods for evaluating the effectiveness of imagery. The PI's prior work shows that effectiveness transformations can be defined in specific domains and that these lead to practical tools for specific retargeting problems. In this project, the PI will build on and generalize these successes to a broader range of subject domains and viewing scenarios. The outcomes of this project will include a better understanding of what makes effective imagery, new methods for creating effective imagery, new guidelines for assessing the effectiveness of imagery, evaluations of the effectiveness of image alterations, as well as practical systems for image and video retargeting problems.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Images can be a powerful mode for communication. Because of this, our computing infrastructure is evolving to deliver imagery. Ubiquitous high-speed networking provides imagery to home theater screens, cellular phone displays, networked PDAs, and even displays embedded in refrigerators, elevators and airplane seats. Unfortunately, imagery is little more than a novelty unless it is effective, that is, it achieves a communicative goal. Yet what makes imagery effective is elusive. It depends on subject matter and intended message. It also depends on the target display device and viewing situation; images effective on a wall-sized display may be ineffective on the display of a cellular phone. The techniques to be developed by the PI in this project will help make effective imagery a reality in a wide variety of situations and for a wide variety of devices, so that increasingly ubiquitous displays can provide people with information when and where they need it, more effective channels of inter-personal communication, and enhanced educational media and entertainment experiences.","title":"Collaborative Research: Retargetable Images and Video","awardID":"0415083","effectiveDate":"2004-08-01","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6845","name":"HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":[250190],"PO":["565227"]},"94913":{"abstract":"Over the last decade, research on discriminative learning methods like support vector machines (SVMs) and boosting has raised the state of the art in machine learning not only with respect to prediction accuracy, but also in terms of theoretical understanding and robustness.

For example, advances in supersymmetric field theory have shed light on four manifold invariants, while advances in algebraic geometry have clarified the origins of mirror symmetry. The aim of this project is to further strengthen this interplay by research focused on three areas of interest to both mathematicians and physicists. The broader impact of this project centers on improved interdisciplinary ties fostered through lectures at schools and workshops, and through direct collaboration. <br\/><br\/>The first research goal is to develop a recently discovered analogue of mirror symmetry for the heterotic string. Conventional mirror symmetry applies to theories with (2; 2) super-symmetry. However, these compactifications constitute a special subclass of more general heterotic string compactifications with only (0; 2) supersymmetry. Many of the interesting structures of (2; 2) theories, like quantum cohomology (or chiral) rings, generalize to this richer setting. Using the dual description, the chiral ring can be determined exactly in many examples, leading to predictions about heterotic string instanton corrections. The study of (0; 2) duality is a topic in its infancy, and there are many directions to explore: for example, S-duality maps heterotic world-sheet instantons into D-instantons of type I open string theory. This suggests a relation between open and closed string instantons, which is likely to be fascinating both to physicists and to geometers. The second area of focus involves compactifications with flux. In the presense of flux, a string target space need not be Ricci-flat. Compact examples of this kind involving just NS-NS fluxes have been found in recent years. These are compactifications with torsion. It is clear that there should be dual descriptions for vacua of this kind (in the sense of mirror symmetry), but there is little currently known about these duals. Since generic string compactifications involve fluxes, constructing dual descriptions for these cases is likely to both enhance our understanding of the string moduli space, and lead to novel questions in mathematics. The third direction revolves around a relation between matrix integrals and modular forms. The twisted partition function for type IIB D-instantons in ten dimensions is computed by evaluating a complicated matrix integral. Yet these matrix integrals are encoded in a particular modular form, which appears in the effective action for the type IIB string. This modular form is completely determined by supersymmetry. The connection between the U-duality group, SL(2;Z), and the matrix integrals is intriguing and puzzling: why is it true? Does it generalize to lower dimensions where the U-duality group is larger? Does it extend to other solitons like monopoles? There are tantalizing hints that the answer to the last two questions is affirmative, but much remains to be understood.","title":"Stringy Mathematics","awardID":"0401814","effectiveDate":"2004-08-01","expirationDate":"2007-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0301","name":"Division of PHYSICS","abbr":"PHY"},"pgm":{"id":"1265","name":"GEOMETRIC ANALYSIS"}},{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0301","name":"Division of PHYSICS","abbr":"PHY"},"pgm":{"id":"1287","name":"MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0304","name":"Division of MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES","abbr":"DMS"},"pgm":{"id":"7454","name":"MSPA-INTERDISCIPLINARY"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0507","name":"Division of SCIENCE EDUCATION RESOURCES IM","abbr":"SER"},"pgm":{"id":"1264","name":"ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM"}}],"PIcoPI":["549268"],"PO":["563190"]},"91900":{"abstract":"DMS-0354543 <br\/>Gunnar E.

This project will develop topological tools for understanding qualitative properties of data sets. We will use homology as applied to data sets directly and to derived complexes to define invariants or signatures that distinguish between the underlying geometric objects. Important goals will include the identification, location, and classification of qualitative features of the data set, such as the presence of corners, edges, cone points, etc. and the use of homology applied to canonically defined blowups and tangent complexes to distinguish between two dimensional shapes in three dimensional Euclidean space. We will use the recently developed techniques of persistence and landmarking to make homology a stable and readily computable invariant. We will also develop the theory of multidimensional persistence, in which one studies spaces that are equipped with several parameters, in order to better understand data sets in which there are several different parameters describing different geometric properties of the space. The overall goal is to continue to develop and improve the available tools for studying qualitative information about geometric objects.<br\/><br\/>The goal of this project is to develop tools for understanding data sets that are not easy to understand using standard methods of statistics and analysis. This kind of data might include singular points, or might be strongly curved. The data is also high dimensional, in the sense that each data point has many coordinates. For instance, we might have a data set whose points each of which is an image, which has one coordinate for each pixel. Many standard tools rely on linear approximations, which do not work well in strongly curved or singular problems. The kind of tools we have in mind are in part topological, in the sense that they measure more qualitative properties of the spaces involved, such as connectedness, or the number of holes in a space, and so on. For example, the project takes the point of view that it is better to understand qualitative properties before attempting to do more precise quantitative analysis and better to distinguish shapes by understanding them qualitatively rather than doing data base comparisons. Thus, methods will be developed to compute, in a timely, robust, and trustworthy manner, the fundamental geometric properties that any realistic mathematical model associated to a given data set must contain. Then statistical and analytic techniques may be applied to the geometrically correct models in order to extract the detailed information desired by practitioners.","title":"FRG: Algebraic topology as a tool in feature location, feature classification, shape recognition, and shape description","awardID":"0354543","effectiveDate":"2004-08-01","expirationDate":"2010-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0304","name":"Division of MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES","abbr":"DMS"},"pgm":{"id":"1267","name":"TOPOLOGY"}},{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0304","name":"Division of MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES","abbr":"DMS"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0304","name":"Division of MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES","abbr":"DMS"},"pgm":{"id":"7454","name":"MSPA-INTERDISCIPLINARY"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2878","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CCF"}}],"PIcoPI":["513423","521232","521231"],"PO":["565280"]},"94925":{"abstract":"Many different criteria can be used to train and evaluate classifiers. Different criteria are appropriate in different settings, and learning methods that perform well on one criterion may not perform well on other. If a user must use a specific learning algorithm or model class, but needs to optimize to a performance measure for which that model class is not designed, they cannot do so. For example, neural nets are easy to train for continuous measures such as squared error and cross-entropy, but are difficult to train for discontinuous measures such as accuracy, Lift, and ROC area. SVMs are designed to optimize accuracy, but not squared error or cross-entropy. Decision trees typically optimize information-theoretic measures or accuracy, but are not designed to maximize ROC area or to minimize squared error. Moreover, for some performance metrics such as Lift we do not yet have any effective learning procedures. <br\/><br\/>We are developing general-purpose cross-optimization methods for training learning algorithms to any performance measure. More specifically, we are developing meta-algorithms for optimizing the performance of different types of classifiers to metrics other than the one for which they were designed. We are using two meta-learning methods to accomplish this. The first is an ensemble learning method can optimize the performance of an ensemble of base-level classifiers to the user's criterion.

Prior work in data mining applied to computer security was geared at finding attack packets, whereas this research aims to find patterns of traffic that indicate anomalous behavior of an application-layer protocol. Traditional methods for determining traffic type rely on the port label carried in the TCP\/UDP packet header. This method can fail, however, in the presence of proxy servers that re-map port numbers, or host services that have been compromised to act as back doors or covert channels. The basis for this exploratory project is the classification of TCP server stream traffic using features that capture stream behavior.

An exciting new direction in this research is the authentication of server flows to detect anomalous and potentially malicious behavior. This research addresses the need for authentication of the application-layer protocol. Because most intrusion detection systems and firewalls rely on knowing the application protocol for determining whether to permit the traffic and for discovering malicious behavior, this research fills a critical gap in current information security technology.

In such activities, the security policies for resource access and user interactions are generally required to be context-based. A user context may be based on various aspects such as physical location, network domain, roles in activities, user interface devices, and any temporal constraints. A mobile user needs to be given access to local and remote re-sources based on the current context. Moreover, it is desired that resource discovery and binding functions are executed transparently and proactively by the application environ-ment and the underlying infrastructure services. Such ubiquitous collaboration environ-ments need decentralized mechanisms for managing and enforcing policies for resource discovery, binding, and protection. The primary focus of this project is on developing system level mechanisms for constructing secure context-aware ubiquitous collaboration environments from their high level specifications. The specification model will support expression of context-based dynamic security policies for users, applications, as well as service\/resource providers. This project will result in a middleware framework to realize from specifications a desired environment with context-based policies. This framework will include mechanisms for proactive discovery and transparent binding of resources for an application. It will support construction of context-aware smart environments by mod-eling infrastructure services as autonomous agents interacting with mobile users.

In contrast to existing frameworks which typically focus on the steady state behavior, this work will develop models for the dynamic behavior of networks. The research focuses on three topics: (1) Models for the dynamics and propagation of network instabilities which encompass models for malicious worm attacks, network and human factors influencing them, and developing mechanisms to detect such attacks; (2) Models for the spatio-temporal aspects of performance metrics like traffic characteristics, delays and packet losses in large scale networks; (3) Models for the dynamics of wireless networks like growth patterns, battery consumption and network life, and spatial characteristics of cluster formations.

Today this critical function is performed by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [rfc1771] which establishes reachability information among Autonomous Systems (ASes). However despite its importance, current measurements and analysis have not led to a basic understanding of BGP's dynamics, performance under stress, fundamental weaknesses, and potential breaking points (if any). Although a few data collection points have been set up in the last few years <br\/>[ipe,routeviews], the routing data collected by these measurement points are mixed with measurement artifacts [ftntalk], thus the data do not necessarily reflect the protocol's behavior in actual operation. <br\/><br\/>In order for the Internet to continue its unprecedented growth, the interdomain routing protocol must continue to evolve to meet ever increasing and sometimes contradictory requirements. There is a general belief that the current BGP routing protocol may be unable to meet its new requirements (for instance, accomodating the sharp increase in use of site multi-homing, which keeps routing tables from optimally small sizes[huston:scale:2001]). BGP is generally thought to be reaching the end of its useful lifetime, although this has not been validated by analysis or measurements [nimrod,irtfrr,huitema:ipng,huston:scale:2001]. Due to the lack of a shared understanding of the problem and lack of sufficient data and analysis, there is no consensus on where\/when BGP collapses and what (if anything) should be done. <br\/><br\/>To address the above critical questions facing interdomain routing, the researchres have assembled a team with research and operational experience, and expertise in network protocols, algorithms, modeling and analysis. The resarchers have identified the following fundamental technical requirements that the global routing must meet: it must scale in order to handle the growth (both in the number of users and in the richness of connectivity); security and resilience are critical issues, so it must continue to function in face of ever increasing faults and attacks; it must be able to fully utilize the rich Internet connectivity; and it must both allow network operators to apply various policy constraints and implementors to easily extend the protocol's functionality when needed. <br\/><br\/>Based on the above criteria the researchers propose to tackle the challenge with the following 3 steps. (1) Develop measurement methodologies and collect data necessary to understand the current BGP operation, its overhead, dynamics under stress, potential vulnerabilities, inadequacies in functionality. The research will base this measurement effort on precise requirements that isidentiied as lacking in existing data, such as for the data not to be collected over vulnerable multihop links [ftntalk]. A new effort at University of Oregon, separate from this proposal, is the measurement companion, if funded. (2) Guided by our measurement and analysis, evaluate several proposed design approaches, including meeting the requirements by tinkering with BGP, by a NIMROD-like [nimrod] maps-approach, by two different approaches to handling multihoming scalability, and by a Clean Slate approach of a complete BGP replacement. Each of these approaches emphasizes different aspects of the interdomain routing problem. The researchers believe there are fundamental trade-offs between many of the desired technical requirements and that these trade-offs are currently not well understood. The combination of measurement and rigorous analysis with a team including operations expertise will bring these trade-offs into clear view. (3) Based on the data analysis and design evaluations the researchers will produce a final approach as the recommendation for moving forward. <br\/><br\/>Through iterations of the above steps, the proposed research undertaking is expected to produce new understanding of current interdomain routing operations, their dynamics and resilience (or lack of it), and vulnerabilities; a new analysis will also be produced that draws on direct and intensive measurement and operations knowledge to capture the fundamental trade-offs among interdomain routing requirements; and a conclusion will be reached on how to meet the future Internet's interdomain routing needs.","title":"Collaborative Research: Beyond BGP: Flexible and Scalable Interdomain Routing (BGGP)","awardID":"0446552","effectiveDate":"2004-08-10","expirationDate":"2007-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["559197"],"PO":["7594"]},"98280":{"abstract":"Studies in Computational Complexity Theory: Project Summary<br\/>Computational complexity theory focuses on understanding capabilities of resource bounded computations.<br\/>Computations are broadly classi.ed as uniform computations (Turing machine based)<br\/>and non-uniform computations (circuit based).

Continuing progress in digital integration and performance is vital to the continued development of information technology (IT). As the number of transistors on an integrated circuit reaches the 1 billion mark, both the current monolithic design style and the globally synchronous clocking and signaling paradigm will fail. The exponential growth in complexity is causing explosions in both design time and cost. In order to achieve the social and economic IT goals of the NSF, dramatic improvements must be made in the processing power, integration, and energy efficiency of digital integrated circuits. Although transistor feature size is expected to continue to scale for at least the next fifteen years, power consumption, global signaling, and clocking have become critical problems that now prevent improvements in system performance, efficiency, and integration. The globally asynchronous locally synchronous (GALS) scheme within a network-on-chip paradigm is a good long-term solution, but this communications-centric methodology can only succeed with a fundamentally new approach to on-chip communication. The investigators are exploring new schemes for global and local communication that take advantage of the capabilities of nanometer CMOS. <br\/>The communications-centric network-on-chip approach places a far greater burden on on-chip communication. Robust communication between asynchronous network components is difficult using present techniques. Modern techniques will also be stretched to their limits to provide adequate local communication. The investigators are developing a new framework for communication across a modular IC, at both the global (full chip) and local (intra-module) levels. Global communication between asynchronous modules is achieved with robust and power efficient serial links instead of traditional parallel buses. This research also concerns new circuit and interconnect structures for local (intra-module) communications and clocking. At a lower level, wires themselves are studied and optimized for both local and global signaling.","title":"Communication Fabrics for the Globally Asynchronous Network-on-Chip Era","awardID":"0429700","effectiveDate":"2004-08-15","expirationDate":"2009-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4710","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["517834","517835","550475"],"PO":["562984"]},"93080":{"abstract":"Proposal No : 0404208<br\/>PI: Shen, Tsung-Cheng<br\/>Title: Atom-Scale Silicon Integrated Circuits for Quantum Computation<br\/><br\/>Abstract:<br\/> <br\/>As the dimensions of each electronic device decrease and the density of devices increases, energy efficiency is one of the mounting challenges to extend Moore's law beyond 22 nm technology node. One way to address this issue is to employ single electron transistors (SETs) to perform logic operations. However, the sensitivity of the SETs also makes them susceptible to any charge defect nearby. As a result, it is very difficult to integrate SETs with the rest of the conventional silicon devices. In this project, we plan to fabricate atom-scale epitaxial SETs by patterning two-dimensional phosphorous dopant atoms inside a silicon crystal. Since the tunneling gap of the SET is of crystalline silicon, charge and noise problems plaguing the conventional metal-based SET could be eliminated. In addition, quantum computation algorithms have proven to be orders of magnitude faster than the classical information processing, at least in a few cases. The SETs are essential to read out the information stored in quantum bits (qbit). The ultimate research goal of this project is to establish all the necessary components, phosphorous donor arrays, integrated SET readout, gates scaled in size and frequency, to demonstrate a prototype quantum information process.

It would be desirable to<br\/>derive such approaches in a systematic manner from general principles and guidelines, and<br\/>to evaluate and compare outlier procedures on such a basis. To date, however, no systematic<br\/>approach for handling outliers in computational geometry problems has been set forth, nor<br\/>has there been advanced a set of specific criteria to be satisfied by outlier procedures.<br\/>Through interdisciplinary collaboration between a computer scientist and a statistical<br\/>scientist, this project will develop an outlier identification and handling approach as a new<br\/>and versatile tool in computational geometry. Structures of a general nature for effective<br\/>outlier identifiers will be formulated. Criteria to be satisfied and desirable qualitative features<br\/>will be formulated. Issues such as robustness of outlier identifiers will be addressed. Efficient<br\/>computing algorithms will be developed. Significant restrictions on current approaches will<br\/>be relaxed.<br\/>The project will focus on outlier handling in shape fitting and dimension reduction prob-<br\/>lems. A leading tool will be depth functions, an emerging methodology in nonparametric<br\/>multivariate data analysis that is useful for description of distributions and data sets and in-<br\/>herently supports characterization of outlyingness for points in a data input. As a byproduct,<br\/>the project will obtain advances in depth function methods as well.<br\/>One proposer has been developing efficient algorithms in computational geometry, the<br\/>other developing depth and outlier methods in multivariate data analysis. One proposer co-<br\/>organized, and both proposers participated in, the recent NSF-sponsored Workshop on Data<br\/>Depth: Robust Multivariate Analysis, Computational Geometry and Applications (DIMACS,<br\/>2003), which fostered the collaboration for this research project.<br\/>The leading intellectual merit of this project is to advance the foundations of computer<br\/>science by providing a general and fundamental method that replaces ad hoc approaches to<br\/>outlier handling. Also, the findings will advance the field of statistical science in the area of<br\/>nonparametric multivariate data analysis.<br\/>Broader impacts of the project include strengthening of the interface between computer<br\/>science and statistical science and involvement of graduate and undergraduate students<br\/>within a team approach as part of their academic experience. Through its wide applica-<br\/>bility the findings of this project will have immediate and central relevance to many areas<br\/>of science, engineering and government.

Unfortunately, the best existing voltage references do not have the thermal stability needed for a wide range of commercial and military applications and the limitations of existing voltage references will be of even more concern in a host of emerging electronic systems. This initiative focuses on an entirely new approach to designing voltage references that uses a new environmental stabilization technique that can be applied in standard processes used in the manufacture of integrated circuits. Central to this work is the investigation of the concept of using a local on-chip heater to measure relative thermal characteristics of an uncalibrated voltage reference and of using information obtained from these measurements to significantly improve the performance of the reference. Although the concept of using an on-chip heater would be of major concern in most integrated circuits because of the increased power dissipation requirements, it is of essentially no concern in the proposed approach since the total power dissipation when the local heater is on is very small and because the total time the heater will be on throughout the life of the integrated circuit will typically be much less than 1 sec. The concept of using a local on-chip heater for thermal stabilization of key properties of integrated circuits should have applications well beyond voltage references and offer potential for providing a much broader impact in the semiconductor field.","title":"Envirostabilized References for Applications in SoC Compatible Processes","awardID":"0429766","effectiveDate":"2004-08-15","expirationDate":"2008-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4710","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["401071","478440"],"PO":["562984"]},"95391":{"abstract":"Human languages make crucial use of pitch to convey information.

First, multiprocessor de-signs are becoming quite common. Second, many applications now exist that require fine-grained adaptivity, i.e., the ability to react to events within short time scales by ad-justing task parameters. Examples of such applications include systems that track people and machines, many computer-vision systems, and signal-processing applications such as synthetic aperture imaging. The goal of this project is to develop techniques for imple-menting such systems on tightly-coupled multiprocessors. The central thesis of this pro-ject is that this goal can best be met by using multiprocessor fair scheduling algorithms. Such algorithms are designed to mimic the allocations of an ideal fluid scheduler, which can react instantaneously to workload changes, while still ensuring real-time constraints.<br\/><br\/>Key objectives of this project include the development of (i) multiprocessor scheduling algorithms that facilitate adaptation, (ii) kernel services for synchronization and I\/O to be used in conjunction with these algorithms, and (iii) mechanisms for determining how and when to adapt. The resulting platform is to be evaluated by implementing a spread-spectrum acoustic full-body tracking system for virtual environments. The proposed tracking system is a good surrogate for the wide range of highly-adaptive computation-ally-intensive real-time applications that exist. Results of this research will be dissemi-nated through publications. Any software of general utility that is produced will be made publically available on the web. This study will lead to a better understanding of the re-source-allocation issues unique to real-time applications with fine-grained adaptivity re-quirements implemented on multiprocessors.<br\/><br\/>Dr. Brett D.

Particular examples of interest to the team include brain-computer interface (BCI) problems and computer-vision and recognition problems. Specifically, the team is relating secant varieties (of arbitrary order) to the determination of optimal projections of data sets; they inquire what order of variety is appropriate and are investigating the relationship between varieties of different orders. Secant varieties also play a role in understanding canonical forms and decompositions of higher-order tensors, which in turn are of fundamental interest in signal-processing applications such as the BCI problem. Algebraic geometry provides a framework for developing algorithms for higher-order tensors. Finally, very recent developments in the Schubert calculus on Grassmannians have dramatically increased the potential applicability of this theory. The investigators are studying how to exploit these ideas to develop efficient algorithms for finding near-optimal projectors subject to constraints. <br\/><br\/>The research, which this team is carrying out, has distinctive impacts on the mathematical and computer science communities.

Similar to the binary bits in classical computation, information can be stored in two-state quantum bits or qubits, which can entangle with each other to provide possibilities of quantum parallelism and quantum computation. The qubit manifests quantum superposition, which enables it to remain in multiple states at the same time, allowing an infinite set of possibilities for storing information. Furthermore, quantum parallelism makes it possible to process information at an astoundingly high speed with more efficient \"quantum\" algorithms. However, the main obstacle towards the practical realization of quantum bit systems is the loss of coherence or decoherence. Due to its coupling to the environmental noise, the quantum bit loses is coherence or its ability to form quantum superposition states, which results in the loss of quantum information. Therefore, it is essential to develop techniques for controlling coherence of to minimize the effect of environmental coupling. <br\/><br\/>This project involves a comprehensive effort for developing control techniques to engineer the coupling between the quantum system and the environment, and increase the coherence time to maintain quantum superposition states for a longer period of time.

The experiments will involve ultra-fast picosecond pulses and pulse trains for designing suitable environment for the electron to control, and perhaps, to reverse the effect of decoherence.

Analysis is the process of predicting the performance of a given design. Synthesis is the process of proposing alternative designs. During any real-world design process, analysis and synthesis tasks are carried out repeatedly until a suitable design is found. Computer-aided design systems use synthesis software which generates a large number of designs each of which is analyzed by an analysis software module. For this process to converge to an acceptable design in a reasonable time, the analysis processes must be fast and accurate.<br\/><br\/>Traditional analysis methods use simulation of the design using detailed models of the design building blocks. Unfortunately, this approach, while fairly accurate, is quite slow for use in conjunction with automated design systems. An alternative is to use performance macromodels which are fast, but tend to be less accurate. This research addresses the problem of developing fast, yet accurate, performance macromodels. Although this research will use applications in electronics design to guide the research direction and to evaluate the research results, the techniques developed will be broadly useful across any engineering design discipline.

Statistical analysis tools that efficiently and accurately capture the multivariate features of such experiments are needed. Classical statistical analysis requires a preliminary assumption as to the underlying probability distribution of the data. This preliminary assumption affects the analysis. Increasingly, statisticians are advocating the geometric notion of data depth (DD) for multivariate data analysis as it requires no prior assumptions on the probability distribution of data and handles outliers. Data-depth-based analysis methods exist, but most of them are not yet sufficiently efficient to handle large datasets. Computational Geometry (CG) focuses on the complexity analysis of geometric problems and the design of effective algorithmic solutions. This project applies CG techniques to develop more efficient tools for DD analysis.

Intellectual merit derives from the dependence of practical implementations of DD on solutions to complex geometric questions, the demand from applied scientists for new methods of statistical analysis and visualization, and the prior recorded success of comparable investigations. The practical algorithms for scientists to apply DD to larger real-world datasets and extract fresh insights, the fresh visualization tools for enhanced understanding, the refinements in the statisticians' DD formulations based on new computational insights, and the training of diverse pre-college, college, and graduate students provide the broader impact.","title":"Impact on Computational Geometry on Depth-Based Statistics","awardID":"0431027","effectiveDate":"2004-08-15","expirationDate":"2008-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"1713","name":"WORKFORCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["426503"],"PO":["565157"]},"93051":{"abstract":"PROPOSAL NO: 0404011<br\/>INSTITUTION: GA Tech Res Corp - GIT<br\/>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Lim , Sung<br\/>TITLE: NER: Automatic Placement Algorithms for Quantum-dot Cellular Automata<br\/><br\/><br\/>Abstract:<br\/>Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is a revolutionary computing paradigm well suited to nano-electronic implementation and scaling to molecular dimensions. In QCA, binary information is encoded in the position of single electrons among a group of dots forming a cell. In QCA, electrons switch between quantum dots within a cell, but no current flows between cells. This leads to extremely low power dissipation and avoids the problem of heat generation that ultimately limits the integration density of transistor circuits. QCA has moved beyond the realm of theory and experimental work-basic QCA devices and logic elements have all been constructed in metal. Our goal is then to develop the first physical design automation toolset that will help to generate computationally interesting, yet implementable circuits in QCA, and significantly expand QCA's existing systems-level infrastructure. We leverage our ties to physical scientists who are working to build real QCA devices. Based upon this interaction, a set of near-term buildability constraints has evolved: essentially a list of logical constructs that are viewed as implementable by physical scientists in the nearer-term. Until recently, most of the design optimizations have been done by hand. Then these initial attempts to automate the process of removing a single, undesirable, and unimplementable feature from a design were quite successful.<br\/><br\/>We now intend to use CAD, especially physical layout automation, to address all undesirable features of design that could hinder movement toward a buildability point in QCA. The net result should be an expanded subset of computationally interesting tasks that can be accomplished within the constraints of a given buildability point. CAD will also be used to project what is possible as the state-of-the-art in physical science expands. Our QCA placement, the first step in QCA physical design automation, is divided into zone partitioning, zone placement, and cell placement steps. The purpose of zone partitioning is to initially partition a given circuit such that a single clock potential modulates the inter-dot barriers of all QCA cells within each zone. The zone placement step takes as input a set of zones; each zone will have been assigned a clocking label that will ensure QCA signals arrive at the proper place at the proper time. The output of zone placement is the best possible layout for arranging the zones on a two dimensional chip area. Finally, cell placement will visit each zone and determine ideal locations for individual QCA logic gates.","title":"NER: Automatic Placement Algorithms for Quantum-dot Cellular Automata","awardID":"0404011","effectiveDate":"2004-08-01","expirationDate":"2006-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1676","name":"NANOSCALE:  EXPLORATORY RSRCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["422053","560915"],"PO":["562984"]},"96010":{"abstract":"0418366<br\/>Ibarra<br\/><br\/>This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place in Mendoza, Argentina in January 2005 on the topic of Advanced Networking Technologies leveraged for Physics and Astronomy.

It uses the interframe subband\/wavelet approach that is accomplished through the use of a motion compensated temporal filter (MCTF). This method has emerged over the recent years as having great potential for video compression closely matched with universal multimedia access and the efficient transmission of video over heterogeneous and lossy networks. There is an on-going standards investigation in this area. <br\/><br\/>Our previous video coder MC-EZBC used 2-tap Haar filters and hierarchical variable-size block matching (HVSBM). The new improved coder uses longer temporal filters and a hierarchical variable size mesh-based motion field. Improvements are anticipated based on various experimental and theoretical findings in the literature, and described more fully in the project description. In performing the MCTF, a key problem is to avoid creating artifacts in the lower frame-rate data by inadvertently filtering along poorly matched paths. A variable size block match field has been used in the past because it is easy to classify the blocks as to whether they should be filtered, predicted, or regarded as I-blocks, and just spatially interpolated. The challenge then is to do the same with the more accurate mesh-based motion models and on a variable size mesh grid. As we find the .true. motion paths, we can then make better use of longer filters, to reduce redundancy and to improve the quality of the video itself. Additionally such a high quality motion field, when made available at the receiver, can enable sophisticated post-processing to be done for adaptation to display characteristics. <br\/><br\/>Level of Effort Statement: <br\/><br\/>During this one-year effort, we will concentrate on scalable motion vector coding and hierarchical variable size mesh model for MCTF with longer filters.

The transformations under consideration are based on so-called \"inequational free theorems\". Such transformations can significantly reduce the tension between expressivity and efficiency in functional languages by automatically removing data constructors and other data-manipulating operators from programs which process data uniformly; formal proofs of safety ensure that transformations which do so do not alter in unexpected ways the observable behavior of the programs to which they are applied. Inequational free theorems-based program transformations for purely strict functional languages, strict functional languages with explicit laziness annotations, and nonstrict languages with polymorphic strictness primitives are considered, and operational, as well as denotational, semantics-based approaches to their provable safety are investigated.

Few sites have the capacity to copy an entire data set to local storage prior to analysis or visualization. In-stead, this work explores distributed access strategies to enable remote applications to query and receive on-demand delivery of relevant fragments of large data sets. Integrated into a data grid that manages distributed data collections, these strategies monitor appli-cation access patterns and pre-fetch and cache needed portions of a data set, delivering to the remote application only the data that is needed, as it is needed. The approach is simi-lar to virtual memory paging systems found in operating systems, but uses knowledge of the spatial and temporal structure of data sets and the application's observed access pat-terns to efficiently pre-fetch, format, cache, and deliver the data. The results of this work enable distributed access to data sets far larger than local storage resources would other-wise allow. Network bandwidth is used more efficiently by transferring only the data that is needed, and local storage is used only as a cache for frequently used portions of a data set. Expected results of this work include predictive pre-fetch algorithms, cost mod-els, and a prototype implementation whose usefulness will be validated by its application to several real-world problems involving distributed access to enormous data sets.<br\/><br\/><br\/>Dr. Brett D.

Garbage collection frees programmers from the burden of explicit memory management, and is necessary for the independence of functional data objects in object-oriented programming paradigms. Unfortunately, traditional garbage collection algorithms are not ideally suited for concurrent operation in real-time embedded systems. On the other hand, cellular systems must also be able to identify and reclaim proteins that are no longer being used or are damaged or incomplete. The selective destruction and recycling of proteins is accomplished by the ubiquitin system in the cell. Proteins to be selectively destroyed are first identified and tagged with ubiquitin through a series of enzymatic reactions. These proteins are then degraded in the proteosome, and their constituent amino acids are recycled for the construction of new proteins.<br\/>We propose using hybrid systems to model the enzymatic pathways in the ubiquitin system to gain insight into their computational properties. Our modeling and simulation efforts will describe how the ubiquitin conjugation ligases and the proteosome interact to selectively recognize the appropriate protein substrates. Our results on the ubiquitin system will help motivate new garbage recognition algorithms for memory management in computer systems. These algorithms will be based upon the hierarchical composition of classifiers that recognize characteristic features of the objects in memory.<br\/>The educational goals of this proposal are closely tied to our research agenda. We hope to introduce students as well as other researchers to the importance of viewing biomolecular sytems as computational systems. The ubiquitin system will serve as a teaching illustration for students in seminars and future workshops, as well as for the public community through our collaboration with the Franklin Institute, the university's AMP summer program, and our annual Robotics for Girls workshop.

However, existing access control mechanisms do not apply because of the unique nature of the information: it is often obtained on-demand from sensors, is dynamic, comes in different levels of precision, and is inherently collected in a distributed fashion. This project is developing access control mechanisms that give users control over who can access information about them. Users specify poli-cies at the level of information without having to be concerned about how that informa-tion is derived. The access control mechanisms support several features that are critical in pervasive computing environments, such as the ability to specify and exploit informa-tion relationships, the use of context-sensitive constraints, and support for specifying ser-vice trust. The system will be implemented and evaluated in the context of the Aura per-vasive computing system. While the focus of the project is on pervasive computing envi-ronments, the results should also apply to other environments that handle dynamic, highly distributed information such as sensor networks. Today, privacy concerns make deploy-ment of pervasive computing technology difficult if not impossible - the proposed re-search will make the deployment of pervasive computing applications feasible.

These arrays are operated and maintained by the UAF group as part of the International Monitoring System (IMS) of the United Nations Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Office (CTBTO). A second array of four microphones is operated by the UAF group as a research array. The group has used this array to test methods of wind-noise reduction, microphone performance and array performance under varying array geometries. As part of the process of identifying infrasound signal sources a prototype locator algorithm was developed that allows estimation of the range to the signal source for locations of the signals source of up to 10 to 15 times the array diameter. The locator algorithm has been used extensively in cases where signal-to-noise levels are high and it appears to be robust.

Aliaga, Mireille Boutin, Carl Cowen<br\/>Purdue University<br\/>The simulation of large real-world environments is a core challenge of computing technology<br\/>today. Applications are numerous and diverse. For example, it would enable students to pay virtual<br\/>visits to famous historical sites such as museums, temples, battlefields, and distant cities; civil<br\/>engineers to capture buildings and compare them to the original design or to simulations (e.g., to<br\/>compare as-built models and simulated models before and after a catastrophe); archeologists to<br\/>virtually preserve complex excavation sites such as trenches as they evolve over time; soldiers and fire<br\/>fighters to train in simulated environments; real estate agents to show buyers the interiors of homes;<br\/>and, people all over the world to enjoy virtual travel or multi-player 3D games.<br\/>Despite tremendous increases in computational power and storage space, current acquisition<br\/>methods perform quite poorly. Even for small scenes, they usually fail to adequately capture many<br\/>details. Manually created models, although popular, are extremely time-consuming and rendered<br\/>images are poor representations of reality. Alternatively, image-based modeling and rendering,<br\/>produces photorealistic images but only in the context of small and\/or diffuse environments seen from<br\/>a limited range of viewpoints (e.g., QuickTime VR). Similarly, approaches which focus on recreating<br\/>the geometry of the scene such as the reconstruction methods developed in computer vision or the<br\/>laser-scanning approaches struggle with complex occlusions, specular surfaces and large data sets.<br\/>The research objective of this proposal is thus to develop the algorithms needed to capture and<br\/>manipulate visually rich computer models of large and complex real-world scenes. The proposal<br\/>attacks this research problem with a new hybrid method combining both geometric and photometric<br\/>information contained in the scene. More precisely, the approach captures a 3D environment by<br\/>densely sampling the space of viewpoints and uses this redundant data set to extract accurate models<br\/>of the surface geometry and the reflectance properties of the scene. This is in contrast with most<br\/>current approaches where one acquires a sparse set of data and uses methods to interpolate missing<br\/>information. The work replaces interpolation by the easier tasks of semi-automatic platform<br\/>navigation, data filtering, and working-set management. The key is the development of highly<br\/>effective mathematical data processing techniques.<br\/>The main research contribution of the proposed approach is the merging of expertise from the<br\/>Mathematical and Computer Sciences to solve a difficult problem in computing technology today. In<br\/>particular, the research makes use of a novel geometry reconstruction method based on Lie group<br\/>theory which was recently developed by one of the co-PIs. This method uses a set of invariants of a<br\/>group action to eliminate a number of superfluous unknowns normally included in the 3D<br\/>reconstruction problem. These superfluous unknowns are exactly the ones that make the<br\/>reconstruction equations nonlinear. By removing them, the method ends up with a simple set of sparse<br\/>linear equations involving a minimum number of unknowns which can be solved sequentially. This<br\/>allows the project to quickly and robustly extract the geometric (and photometric) information of large<br\/>data sets and reconstruct large 3D environments.<br\/>The proposed research will have impact beyond the immediate reconstruction results.

Hard-ware designers have responded by developing devices (e.g. hard disks and net-works) that can be \"powered down\" (dropped into a non-operational mode) when inactive, and other devices (e.g. processor components) that can be \"scaled back\" (by reducing voltage or reallocating in part to other threads), to operate below their peak performance and power. To utilize such devices effectively, the operating system must dynamically \"shape\" the offered load. For \"power down\" devices it should aim for burstiness, to maximize the length of low-power inter-vals and minimize the number of costly state transitions. For \"scale back\" de-vices it should aim for smoothness, to leverage the nonlinear dependence of power on voltage and to avoid paying for unutilized resources. For devices with both capabilities it must balance the benefits of the two approaches.<br\/><br\/>Work is addressing both existing and emerging architectures, including single-threaded, multi-threaded, and clustered processors. Expected results include (1) the characterization of server and mobile workloads in terms of behavior variability and (2) scheduler and device management strategies that combine run-time instrumentation with profiles of past behavior to model the needs of all running applications, and to match those needs to available resources. Dis-semination will be achieved via publications, students, open source software tools, and\/or industry collaboration.

And there is a critical need for such coalitions (sometimes called grids) to be regulated in order to ensure conformance with their defining policy and in order to protect the interest of member organizations. With current technologies, such a regula-tion is usually carried out in an ad hoc manner, often involving manual intervention by administrators of individual organizations, or by officers of the coalition. This makes the deployment of a coalition, and its evolution, very laborious, inflexible and unreliable.<br\/><br\/>The objectives of this project is to develop a regulatory mechanism for dynamic coali-tions, that has the following characteristics: (1) high expressive power; (2) scalable en-forcement; and (3) flexibility, which means that (i) each member-organization is able to formulate its internal policy, and to change it at will---subject only to the global coalition policy---independently of the internal policies of other organizations in the coalition; (ii) and it is easy for a new member to join a given coalition.<br\/><br\/>This project should have the following impact: First, it would provide flexible and secure means for various organizations to collaborate by forming coalitions. Second, the con-cept of policy-hierarchy to be developed, would be useful in many domains, besides coa-litions--such as in establishing regulatory frameworks for organizations that consists of many departments. Third, the regulatory mechanism for coalitions would be useful in the teaching of software engineering, distributed systems, and e-commerce.<br\/>Dr. Brett D.

While humans easily comprehend disfluent speech, computer speech recognizers often fail to separate disfluent regions from surrounding context, resulting in failed transcription and loss of meaning. This project develops disfluency recognition for automatic speech recognition by investigating perceptually salient acoustic correlates of disfluency. Effects of disfluency on the pitch, energy and voice source features are examined in the Switchboard corpus of spontaneous speech. The approximate repetition of pitch and energy contours is investigated as a cue marking the dependency between a disfluency and its subsequent repair. Analysis-by-synthesis techniques are adapted from the Stem-ML model of speech generation to recognize prosodic repetition that is often obscured by differences in scaling. Voice quality correlates of disfluency, such as glottalization, are tracked through several acoustic measures of the spectral envelope, with ROC testing performed to determine the best predictors. Correlations between disfluency and intonational features marking accent and phrasing are examined through the creation of a ToBI-standard intonation labeling of the speech corpus. Acoustic and prosodic correlates of disfluency are combined with a repetition language model in the design of a speech recognizer that automatically transcribes both words and disfluencies. The recognizer integrates cues at multiple linguistic levels which together serve to identify regions of disfluency in spontaneous speech. <br\/><br\/>This research will advance speech technology by enabling recognition of disfluency in natural speech.

In this project, the PI will address this problem by developing a new taxonomy of command selection mechanisms used in graphical interfaces. The goal is to identify the fundamental traits of each technique, understand the pros and cons of each of these traits, and study their possible interactions. To this end, the PI will develop a notation that provides a powerful tool for comparing existing technique, and that will also serve as a road map for fruitful future development in the domains of sensing and interaction design. Following the example of previous models (e.g. the GOMS family), the PI's notation will be grounded in systematic study and empirical evaluations of the key traits relevant to command selection. This will allow for accurate predictions of the performance of new techniques and provide a clear, quantitative understanding of the relative importance of different options in creating command selection mechanisms for new families of devices. As part of this phase of the work, the PI will investigate how users transition from a mode of operation requiring visual feedback to a mode of operation relying mostly on muscle memory. While the former is relatively well understood and captured by Fitt's and Accot's laws, the latter is still experimentally unexplored. This line of study will use eye-tracking technology as its main investigative tool. Finally, the PI will illustrate the potential of his notation by re-evaluating existing techniques, and by developing an efficient new interface for tablet computers based on goal-crossing instead of pointing-and-clicking. Recent empirical results have shown that goal crossing is at least as efficient as aiming in many common tasks. This makes the goal-crossing paradigm a strong contender as a fluid and efficient command selection mechanism for pen computing.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: By providing a better understanding of the interplay among hardware, interaction structure, and user skill level, this research will create a solid foundation for a systematic exploration of the design space. The PI's findings will reduce the intrinsic complexity of basic graphical command selection. In particular, the studies on the transition from procedural to autonomous interaction will help intermediate users reach expert performance more rapidly, and improve ease of use for difficult interactions such as navigating a cascading menu. Finally, exploration of a new interaction paradigm based on goal-crossing will allow users of pen-based systems to interact more fluidly with these devices. One of the main outcomes of this part of the project will be a new toolkit based on goal-crossing interactions, which the PI will make freely available to other researchers.","title":"Towards Better Command Selection Mechanisms for GUIs","awardID":"0414699","effectiveDate":"2004-08-15","expirationDate":"2009-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6845","name":"HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6850","name":"DIGITAL SOCIETY&TECHNOLOGIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7496","name":"COLLABORATIVE SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["475376"],"PO":["565227"]},"98752":{"abstract":"This project investigates signal processing and machine learning algorithms for identifying and localizing one or multiple targets in the acoustic scene.

However there are computational devices much<br\/>closer to home. All biological organisms are exposed almost continuously to a huge variety of<br\/>environmental changes and shocks. In order to survive such changes, living organisms have<br\/>evolved sensor proteins located on the outer surface of the organism which can detect all manner<br\/>of environmental changes. These sensor proteins are in turn connected to so-called signaling<br\/>networks composed of interacting proteins inside the cell. These signaling networks are<br\/>responsible to making an appropriate decision based on all the sensory inputs. What is not well<br\/>understood at this stage is the type of decision processing that is carried out by these networks. In<br\/>man made devices we employ a variety of techniques from digital computers to analog devices<br\/>to control our machines. Over the last fifty years or so, the design of sophisticated man-made<br\/>control devices has matured to the extent that almost all devices now have some kind of control<br\/>systems built into them. The reason why we are so good at designing artificial control systems is<br\/>that we have a thorough grasp of the underlying theoretical principles of control.

Our<br\/>approach is to evolve on digital computers, artificial biological signaling networks. Depending<br\/>on what task the network is designed to perform, we evolve networks which will come closest to<br\/>achieving this objective. Examples include evolving a network which can be robust to sudden<br\/>changes in the environment, or conversely evolving networks which can quickly respond to<br\/>environmental changes. In addition other objectives will include common signal processing<br\/>techniques employed in electronics, for example we might evolve a network that can oscillate or<br\/>a network that can carry out some arithmetic. By these means we will generate biological like<br\/>networks which will have the capacity to carry out all the common electronic signal processing<br\/>tasks.

Surprisingly, the possible interaction between unrelated infections has not received much attention. A mechanism for interaction between (antigenically) different infections is proposed: following an acute infection, individuals are temporarily unavailable to contract other diseases (because of quarantining during convalescence). Hence, the number of potential \"hosts\" for a pathogen is affected by the dynamics of other diseases; this is even more pronounced if infection is associated with mortality, with some hosts removed permanently. This mechanism leads to \"disease interference\". This proposal aims to develop this framework, answering fundamental ecological and evolutionary questions. Do all infections interact with all other infections? The answer is clearly no. The strength of interaction between infections depends on the degree similarity in the cohort of hosts infected. For human infections, this would be determined by the overlap between the distributions of host age at infection. Does interference affect evolutionary dynamics? A central hypothesis is that interference selects for increased pathogenicity. Can we explore interference effects when genetic diversity is well established (eg Dengue)? The interference mechanism provides a null model for the study of infections with multiple strains. Is this work likely to have public health implications? Preliminary work suggests interference effects may be beneficially used to eradicate infections using fewer vaccine units than conventional estimates. This proposal also aims to construct statistical tools whereby the signature of interference may be confidently detected from data.","title":"Ecology and Evolution of Disease Interference","awardID":"0343176","effectiveDate":"2004-08-01","expirationDate":"2008-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0801","name":"Division of ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY","abbr":"DEB"},"pgm":{"id":"1127","name":"EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES CLUSTER"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0801","name":"Division of ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY","abbr":"DEB"},"pgm":{"id":"1128","name":"POP & COMMUNITY ECOL CLUSTER"}}],"PIcoPI":["452998"],"PO":["563582"]},"98059":{"abstract":"0429523 <br\/>Rajendra S.

The main advantage of the <br\/>algorithms developed is that they examine the binary numbers from left-to-right. The <br\/>algorithms must result in minimal joint weight to reduce the number of operations in the <br\/>multi-exponentiation operation used in cryptography. Developing such algorithms for <br\/>more than one integer has never been done before. In fact this was considered as a hard <br\/>problem in the literature. The PI developed a left-to-right recoding algorithm for two <br\/>integers that resulted in minimal joint weight. This resulted in a solution to a problem that <br\/>had been an open problem since 2001. Extending this to the general case of N integers <br\/>will be considered. This extension is no trivial task because the only known solution to <br\/>minimal joint weight recoding of N integers examines the integers from right-to-left. <br\/>Examining the integers from left-to-right makes the algorithm compatible with Shamir.s <br\/>left-to-right multi-exponentiation method. This leads to less memory requirement for <br\/>multi-exponentiation, which is very important in memory-constrained systems like smart <br\/>cards. Other extensions like recoding for sliding window methods of multi-<br\/>exponentiation will also be considered. In this case the algorithms developed, other than <br\/>being left-to-right will also maximize the length of zeros between windows. This again <br\/>results in decreasing memory requirement while increasing the speed of multi-<br\/>exponentiation. Recoding with other digit sets like {0,1,-1,3,-3} will also be considered. <br\/>Recodings developed by the proposed project are useful in cases where group inversion is <br\/>very fast.

Outcomes of the project will include novel\/improved facial tracking and bio-heat modeling algorithms that: will allow contact-free and accurate measurement of vital signs without restricting the user; will enable the study of ubiquitous ailments like stress, heartbeat irregularities, and headaches on an unprecedented continuous basis; and will serve as a catalyst for the creation of new HCI paradigms that incorporate the computer as an aware and responsive partner with the user (e.g., in which the computer can react in real time to physiologic data for the benefit of the user). <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: In the short term, the results of this project will provide less cumbersome tools for those attempting to conduct research in the areas of usability and of emotional and affective interfaces. In the longer term, they will support a fundamental change in the way that we interact with machines. Today, software designers create systems that they hope will not frustrate the users. In the future, software designers will create truly collaborative interactions in which human and machines are both observing and responding. This has the potential to greatly improve the usability of systems for the elderly, minorities, the economically disadvantaged, and other populations impacted by the \"digital divide.\" On the clinical front, developing systems that can monitor the health status of an individual will revolutionize remote monitoring and the care of chronic conditions such as anxiety, heartbeat irregularities, and headaches.","title":"Interacting with Human Physiology","awardID":"0414754","effectiveDate":"2004-08-01","expirationDate":"2008-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6845","name":"HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":[250066,"532471",250068],"PO":["565227"]},"98511":{"abstract":"Biological organisms are self-organized chemical systems that carry out algorithms encoded in the genetic<br\/>material, DNA.

The last decade has<br\/>seen significant advances in communications technology and infrastructure;<br\/>prime examples are the world-wide web, wireless computing and sensor networks.<br\/>These modern applications lead to a vast variety of interesting problems --- these range<br\/>from complex design constructions, data warehousing and retrieval problems, to the need for <br\/>intelligent analysis of huge amounts of data. As a response to these needs,<br\/>many new matrix problems arise that need to be solved robustly and efficiently.<br\/><br\/>Some of the most challenging problems in the analyses of large data matrices are the<br\/>related problems of clustering, co-clustering (simultaneous clustering<br\/>of rows and columns), and matrix approximations. In many applications, the data<br\/>is not Gaussian, and hence traditional techniques, such as singular value<br\/>decomposition (SVD) and classical Euclidean k-means are often inadequate.<br\/>The proposed project formulates new matrix approximation problems related to<br\/>co-clustering: these formulations appeal to a generalized maximum entropy principle<br\/>to search for structured matrix approximations that arise naturally for an important<br\/>class of statistical distributions, known as exponential families. The aim of the<br\/>project is to develop the theory as well as robust, numerical software for these<br\/>matrix computations.<br\/><br\/>Another important class of problems contains varied inverse problems: given<br\/>a set of desirable properties, construct a data matrix that satisfies these properties.<br\/>Such inverse problems arise in diverse applications, such as the design of<br\/>kernel similarity matrices for statistical learning and the design of Gram matrices<br\/>with low cross-correlations for wireless communications. The plan is to<br\/>use alternate projection schemes, and numerical optimization to solve such design<br\/>problems. The outcome of the project would be a unified framework for these inverse<br\/>problems, including modeling, algorithms and software.<br\/><br\/>It is anticipated that there will be two broad research impacts of the proposed project.<br\/>The first contribution would be to applied mathematics and computer science<br\/>--- the formulation and proposed solutions of the novel matrix problems that<br\/>arise naturally in applications. It is hoped that the proposed work will vitalize the<br\/>search for better algorithms, and further deepen the connections between applied mathematics<br\/>and engineering. The second contribution would be to the applications themselves.

For example, small cell sizes and unlicensed spectrum lead to sophisticated spatial interaction,<br\/>there is a lack of common air-interface to support mobile and time-sensitive applications, and interactions<br\/>among competing users, both access points and mobile stations, could form surprising and unpredictable<br\/>patterns. In addition, end-to-end transmissions in a wireless LAN often traverse a hybrid network, with<br\/>wireless hops as well as wired links in the backbone. This presents unique challenges in cross layer TCP-IP-<br\/>MAC-PHY interactions and offers new opportunities to optimize medium access control (MAC) and physical<br\/>layer (PHY) algorithms to enhance the end user experience.<br\/>There is no shortage of near term ideas from both industry and academia about how to improve the<br\/>delivery of wireless Internet services. What is missing is an optimization framework that captures utility at<br\/>the level of networked applications, and makes it possible to figure out whether any particular incremental<br\/>change at the MAC or PHY layer is positive or negative. The gap is the focus of this SGER proposal.<br\/>Kelly and Low have created the counterpart of this utility maximization framework in the wired world,<br\/>and it has led to a deeper understanding of TCP congestion control and to the development and field<br\/>testing of the new 'FAST TCP' protocol by the high energy physics community. The key insight in this<br\/>approach is to start with a given network protocol and ask: 'If this distributed protocol is the solution to an<br\/>underlying global optimization problem, what is that optimization problem?' The wireless world presents a<br\/>very significant challenge and the new framework needs to capture spatial interaction within a cell, operation<br\/>in unlicensed spectrum, a mix of contention and scheduling at the MAC layer, and the flexibility of achieving<br\/>different rate-reliability tradeoffs by coding techniques.<br\/>For example, we know that TCP throughput can be improved through coordination of spatial resources,<br\/>specifically through space-time coding. Embedded diversity transforms spatial diversity into a fine grained<br\/>resource that can provide opportunistic communication when the channel is good and reliable communication<br\/>with latency guarantees when it is less benign. We expect to see significant benefits in specific cross layer<br\/>designs based on a completed framework of wireless utility maximization, but the value of the proposal is a<br\/>general proof of principle that can apply to an arbitrary wireless protocol or coding technique.<br\/>Project Focus and Intellectual Merit: This SGER project is a proof of concept - the particular<br\/>focus is on modelling the medium access mechanisms and leveraging the new coding paradigm of embedded<br\/>diversity. The particular objective in the next 12 months of SGER investigation is to identify the global<br\/>optimization problem to which coding (with embedded diversity) and scheduling (for medium access) is the<br\/>solution.<br\/>Preliminary results have recently been obtained by the PIs on tackling interference in utility maximization<br\/>problems and on designing new space-time codes with embedded diversity. We believe that by filling in<br\/>two remaining holes: modelling medium access and leveraging coding techniques, a complete and widely<br\/>applicable framework of wireless network utility maximization will be completed at the conclusion of the<br\/>SGER project.<br\/>Broader Impacts: The research activities in this SGER proposal will be fully integrated with a variety<br\/>of educational activities currently pursued by the PIs. These include curriculum developments of four new,<br\/>inter-disciplinary courses at Princeton, two at undergraduate level and two at introductory graduate level,<br\/>active supervision of undergraduate research projects on wireless LAN, and student summer internships<br\/>being arranged with our industrial partners.<br\/>A unique and important aspect of this proposal is a detailed arrangement of close collaboration with<br\/>five major telecom and networking companies in the wireless LAN space: AT&T Labs, Cisco, Flarion<br\/>Technologies, Intel, and SBC.

Powerful new tools from hyperbolic geometry are applied to the simplification problem. These tools enable linear-time estimation of the effect on the solution of a change in the boundary using purely geometric analysis and without prior information about the solution. The simplification algorithm is based on a partitioning of the original geometry into simpler shapes.<br\/><br\/>Brain injury is an enormous medical problem in the U.S., with 1.5 million new cases per year, $56 billion spent on medical expenses, and countless lives affected adversely.

These two disparate problems share in common the property that they are amenable to computer modeling and analysis. Furthermore, for accurate results, both applications require computer modeling of complex geometric shapes. Unfortunately, complex geometric shapes require time-consuming computations on large high-performance computers and thus limit the practical applicability of computer modeling. The project invents computer methods that can quickly and accurately simplify complex geometries. \"Accurately\" in this context means that the simplification is guaranteed not to change the outcome of the simulation by more than a small percentage.

These include the number of neurons, the average number of neurons each neuron synapses with, and the basic response time of a neuron to its inputs. A fourth parameter is the strength of influence that a neuron has through its synapses on a typical neuron with which it synapses. Given the limited resources that the brain has, as summarized by these four parameters as currently understood, it turns out to be highly challenging to explain how the brain can perform even the most basic information processing tasks. In particular, the sparsity of the interconnection pattern in conjunction with generally weak synapses appears to impose very considerable constraints.

In particular the challenge is to explain how multiple tasks, such as memorization, association and inductive learning, can be supported together in such a system.","title":"BIC: Neural Computation That Supports Multiple Cognitive Tasks","awardID":"0432037","effectiveDate":"2004-08-15","expirationDate":"2008-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1705","name":"BIOLOGY & INFORMATION TECHNOLO"}}],"PIcoPI":["438597"],"PO":["474792"]},"94652":{"abstract":"SGER: Wireless Techniques for Architecture and Fault Tolerance<br\/><br\/>The research will investigate the viability of using wireless communication as a side-channel for communication in a computer system to increase performance and reliability.

The distribution of molecular charge among the redox centers represents binary information. The key to QCA behavior is that a local electric field, the \"driver field,\" due to a neighboring molecule alters the charge configuration of another molecule in a nonlinear way. Demonstration of field-effect switching of molecular charge configuration is the focus of the proposed research. The use of scanning probes with molecular resolution is crucial to this investigation.

We are investigating one aspect of a molecular QCA implementation - the switching of one molecule by the influence of a neighboring molecule.

In both levels, design for verifiability, hierarchical verification (formal and semi-formal), and coverage-based analysis will be stressed. Course modules and courseware will be developed and made available via the Internet. The specific tasks for this proposal include the following: (1) re-design the undergraduate design projects such that they become verification-aware and verification-centric, starting from the initial phases of the design; (2) embed verification fundamentals to design courses content and syllabi; (3) introduce an entry-level foundations graduate course that covers mathematical theories and formulations behind today's technology;<br\/>(4) continue cutting-edge verification research to advance the knowledge base; (5) acquire open-source tools and other commercial verification engines through University programs to integrate into the curricula; (6) integrate course modules (lectures and projects) and provide them on the Internet. The impact of this research project not only includes students with a deeper understanding of the role of verification-centric design style, our research and courseware will also reduce the need for other academic and industrial educators to develop similar material across the many courses. Finally, with publications via conferences and journals, the knowledge acquired will also be readily available to the research community.","title":"CRCD\/EI: Curriculum and Course Modules for Bridging the Verification Gap","awardID":"0417340","effectiveDate":"2004-08-15","expirationDate":"2008-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1709","name":"CISE EDUCAT RES & CURRIC DEVEL"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4710","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["542380","475415","494757","384407"],"PO":["474792"]},"98733":{"abstract":"Spectral imagery has emerged in the past decade as one of the most powerful tools to be applied<br\/>to the problem of measurement and signals intelligence (MASINT). A conventional imaging sensor measures the radiance over a broad range of wavelengths at every pixel in a scene. A spectral sensor provides more information to the observer by measuring the radiance in a number of spectral bands across an interesting region of the spectrum. The infrared detectors proposed here represent a revolutionary change in sensors for spectral imagery and other MASINT applications. As discussed below, the spectral response can be controlled and adapted simply by changing the bias voltage of the FPA. This spectral agility will allow two-color, multispectral, and low-resolution hyperspectral imagery to be performed with the same detector, and the spectral sensitivity, bandwidth, and number of bands can be independently controlled at will. A novel, normal incidence mid-infrared quantum dot (QD) detector based on intersubband transitions is at the heart of the new technology. These nanoscale, self-assembled detectors have shown a broad response with voltage bias dependent tunable spectral characteristics. In this effort, the team emphasize 1) controlling the spectral response and tenability of the QD detectors, 2) understanding the performance characteristics of arrays of the QD detectors, to include noise and pixel-to-pixel nonuniformity, and 3) how to use this new class of sensor to perform adaptive spectral imagery The team includes students from under-represented groups at a major minority-serving institution.","title":"Tunable Infrared Photodetectors for MASINT Applications","awardID":"0434102","effectiveDate":"2004-08-01","expirationDate":"2008-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"T377","name":"DIA-MASINT CONSORTIUM PROJECT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"V579","name":"DEFENSE-NATL MASINT CONSORTIUM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"V918","name":"DIA-SOW"}}],"PIcoPI":["417282","450666","557223"],"PO":["565136"]},"97897":{"abstract":"The transmission of information over a communication channel often involves channels whose characteristics are unknown. The information is therefore distorted by an unknown channel which in addition adds random noise to the message. If the channel characteristics are known, then the non random part of the distortion can usually be compensated at the receiver, and the problem is one of detecting the messages buried in noise. If the channel characteristics are unknown, then a crucial step is to estimate the channel first. Under certain conditions it is indeed possible to do this estimation from the received data itself. This approach, called blind identification of channels, has been studied in the past. The investigator studies new methods for such identification based on frequency domain information of the channel. <br\/><br\/>In recent years the tremendous power of redundant filter bank precoders has been established. Precoders not only allow linear distortions introduced by known channels to be cancelled with finite duration filters at the receiver, they also allow the identification of unknown channels without training sequences and without the need for fourth order statistics. The research studies several new methods for blind identification and channel equalization based on filter bank precoders. One of these is blind channel identification directly in the frequency domain. This offers tremendous simplicity in computations. The research also seeks to explore tradeoff of complexity between transmitters and receivers. In the past, precoders have emphasized low transmitter complexity of zero-padded systems. The investigators study zero-jamming at the receiver as an alternative. The research also addresses a number of important issues which arise in the context of designing systems that are resistant to channel nulls.","title":"New Directions in Signal Processing for Digital Communications","awardID":"0428326","effectiveDate":"2004-08-15","expirationDate":"2008-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["321961"],"PO":["564898"]},"99745":{"abstract":"The University of California at San Diego has been granted an award to facilitate student and young scientist participation in the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference in Glasgow Scotland in July of 2004.

But while studies have shown that tactual perception is the best modality for comprehension of graphical images by people who are visually impaired, the graphical images found in textbooks typically aren't available in this format. Visually impaired students' lack of full access to the contents of textbooks impedes their learning, development, and success in MSE careers, areas in which individuals with disabilities are underrepresented. This project seeks to address this problem, by developing innovative ways to overcome obstacles to the timely translation of graphical images into a tactual format. The needs of two user communities will be addressed: transcribers who translate graphical images into tactual formats within low- and high-production environments; and students who are in MSE classes at the K-12 and postsecondary education levels, are blind, and read Braille. To these ends, the PI has assembled an interdisciplinary team with expertise in image processing, machine learning, IR, HCI, experiment design, and addressing the needs of students with disabilities. The PI and his team will design and develop the Tactile Graphics Assistant (TG Assistant), a set of plug-ins for Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, which will support transcribers in transforming, as automatically and intelligently as possible, graphical images into a high-quality tactual form that can be reproduced and then used by students who are blind. Empirical studies will be conducted to better understand the perception of tactile graphics, and to inform the design of prediction models to estimate image comprehension time and comprehension accuracy, the application of machine learning techniques to classify images by their type, and the design of image processing algorithms to carry out the steps (appropriate for the image type) to translate an image into a tactual form. A user-centered design approach will be followed during the development of the TG Assistant. Project benefits will be documented by three proof-of-concept activities, wherein the TG Assistant will be used to provide access to textbook images to three students at the K-8, high school, and postsecondary education levels. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impact.

The project will also focus on selected programs, services, staff, and students at Contra Costa College, an institution that has had a high rate of success in transferring minority students to four-year colleges and universities in mathematics, computer science, and engineering.","title":"ITWF: Mathematics Socialization & Identity","awardID":"0533556","effectiveDate":"2004-08-16","expirationDate":"2007-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1713","name":"WORKFORCE"}}],"PIcoPI":[289402],"PO":["564181"]},"94389":{"abstract":"National Science Foundation<br\/>Distributed Systems Research <br\/>CISE\/CNS<br\/><br\/><br\/>ABSTRACT<br\/><br\/>Proposal Number: 0410042<br\/>Principal Investigator: Herlihy, Maurice<br\/>Institution: Brown University<br\/>Proposal Title: Transactional Memory<br\/><br\/><br\/>This project focuses on an new approach to multiprocessor synchronization called transactional memory. This approach replaces conventional locking techniques with light-weight transactions: sequences of instructions that ap-pear to execute atomically. Transactional memory relies on a combination of hardware and software support. The project explores the interface between hardware and software support for transactions. Hardware is well-suited for short transactions that access a small memory region, but is less effective for longer transactions, or transactions that access more memory. Transactions that cannot be executed directly in hardware must be executed partially or en-tirely in software, and the project is investigating a range of possible trade-offs.<br\/>The project also explores the implications of the transactional memory model for the design of highly-concurrent data structures. While transactional mem-ory provides better support for fine-grained concurrency than conventional ock-ing techniques, it also provides opportunities for new kinds of data structure designs and algorithms.<br\/><br\/>This project addresses a fundamental problem in modern computing. Every year, processors get faster and cheaper. Recently, however, fundamental limita-tions such as heat dissipation have made advances in clock speed increasingly difficult. An alternative approach, called multiprocessing, harnesses multiple processors to work together. Unfortunately, current techniques for multiproc-essor synchronization are difficult to use, and scale poorly to large-scale sys-tems. This alternative synchronization model investigated by this project prom-ises to one substantial barrier to more effective multiprocessor computing.

A limited training set is augmented with background knowledge of pen strokes: how they generate characters and how they can result in image pixels. EBL and SVMs are combined in two ways: (1) \"phantom examples\" are generated to enable learning with fewer input examples, and (2) EBL is used to generate new kernel functions for the SVM. The expected scientific advances include machine recognition of pictogram characters, concept learning in domains where training examples are scarce, and explanation-based learning with imperfect domain theories. Potential broader impacts include more automated preservation and dissemination of historical Chinese texts through the production of clean machine-readable copies and easier application of conventional machine translation systems to pictogram languages without the stumbling block of image input; automatic processing of pictogram and other line-drawing input may in turn enable new computer-based educational applications and opportunities.

Specifically, there are three thrust areas under the overarching theme of energy constraints and network lifetime on which we are concentrating our efforts: (1) maximizing network lifetime through optimal power-controlled flow routing; (2) understanding performance limits and the trade-offs between relay node placement and energy provisioning; and (3) uncovering the inherent properties associated with the energy-constrained rate allocation problem.

The research in the first area will help us to develop basic research methodologies for the study of lifetime-centric flow routing in sensor networks. The research in the second area will enhance understanding of performance limits and trade-offs with significant implications for both theory and practice.

Such a skeleton can be employed to quickly esti-mate the performance of a long running application on a given set of execution nodes even when the nodes and network links are shared. This project is per-forming research to enable automatic construction of performance skeletons of resource intensive applications. A performance skeleton must mimic application execution behavior, such as computation, memory, and communication pat-terns, in order to model the application's performance. The approach being taken to construct the performance skeleton of an application consists of the following steps:<br\/><br\/>(1) Execute the target application and record the execution trace that captures detailed CPU, memory and network activity. (2) Capture repeated patterns in the application execution trace and summarize it as a compact execution signa-ture. (3) Generate the performance skeleton executable program from the summarized system activity captured by the execution signature.<br\/><br\/>Performance modeling is central to effective use of high performance computa-tional resources. Performance skeletons represent a fast, innovative and accu-rate approach to estimating the performance of long running applications on diverse and unpredictable grid environments. Accurate performance estimation with this method typically takes only a few seconds of skeleton execution for applications that run for several hours.

The conference has two goals. The first is to survey the current state of the field, by providing an historical overview of what has been accomplished during the last five decades of speech research, and by sampling some of the most interesting recent work in this active and exciting research topic. Twenty-one invited speakers will present talks in six different areas: Phonology and Phonetics; Speech Acoustics; Speech Perception; Planning and Production; Development, Pathologies and Remediation; and Speech Technology. The second goal is to promote cross-fertilization among the subdisciplines, to benefit future work in this field of study, which has its foundations in the physical, engineering, linguistic, cognitive and medical sciences. To this end the conference is organized in single sessions, rather than multiple parallel sessions, so that everyone will hear all presentations and participate in the discussions together. Many of the presentations will be archived as written papers at an MIT web site and distributed as a CD, and all of the sessions will be videotaped (if funds permit), offering a rich resource for both students and established investigators. <br\/><br\/>Many of the historical overviews will be presented by senior researchers such as Gunnar Fant, Kenneth Stevens, Peter Ladefoged, John Ohala, David Pisoni, Bjorn Lindblom, Victor Zue and Ray Kent, who have done pioneering work in their subdisciplines, including advances such as <br\/>-the source-filter theory of speech acoustics, which models the way that changes in the size and shape of the vocal tract produce the sounds of a spoken utterance, <br\/>-the quantal theory of acoustic-articulatory mapping, which identifies the acoustically stable articulations that provide some of the bases for sound categories in languages of the world, <br\/>-models of human speech perception, production, development and pathologies, which relate models of the acoustics and articulation of speech to human language processing, and <br\/>-algorithms for the automatic recognition and synthesis of speech, which not only provide aids for the handicapped, but also serve as tools for testing our models of human speech processing. <br\/>The invited speakers who were responsible for these advances bring the valuable perspective of decades of thinking about and investigating speech to their historical overviews.

These include how individual languages make different use the special articulatory-acoustic mapping properties of the vocal tract, how the brain operates to process speech both as input and as output, and how automatic recognition and synthesis can take advantage of our increasing understanding of how speech is processed by humans, to create better tools for human-computer and human-human interactions by spoken language. A final summarizing address, followed by a discussion forum, will synthesize the ideas presented at the conference, with a focus on how future speech research can benefit from interaction among the represented sub-specialties.","title":"Conference - From Sound to Sense: Fifty+ Years of Discoveries in Speech Communication","awardID":"0418205","effectiveDate":"2004-08-01","expirationDate":"2008-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0404","name":"Division of BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE SCI","abbr":"BCS"},"pgm":{"id":"1311","name":"LINGUISTICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0404","name":"Division of BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE SCI","abbr":"BCS"},"pgm":{"id":"7252","name":"PERCEPTION, ACTION & COGNITION"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7274","name":"HUMAN LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["468803","511474"],"PO":["564500"]},"96965":{"abstract":"This project, establishing a wireless and sensor networking laboratory, supports the following research projects:<br\/> Area Coverage in Wireless Ad-Hoc Sensor Networks,<br\/> Efficient Broadcasting in Wireless Ad-Hoc Sensor Networks, and<br\/> Topology control in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks with Hitch-Hiking.<br\/>In the 1st project, an energy-efficient localized and distributed area coverage protocol will be designed that provides sensor network connectivity and a reliable retrieval mechanism. The performance of the protocol will be analyzed for a sensor network through simulation using the Opnet network simulator, and the protocol will be implemented and tested on the MICA mote sensor platform. This area coverage problem has applications in disaster recovery, environmental monitoring, and homeland defense. In the 2nd project, efficient broadcast protocols that fit the wireless sensor network characteristics will be designed, these protocols will be simulated for large networks using Opnet and implemented and tested on the MICS mote sensor platform. Broadcast, an important operation in wireless ad-hoc sensor networks, is often encountered, for example, in data diffusion and on-demand gathering. Because of transmission redundancy, a factor that increases heavily contentions and collisions, broadcast by flooding does not constitute a feasible solution. Thus, the forwarding node needs to be selected carefully, considering the basic characteristics of a wireless sensor network, such as lack of global sensor information and resource limitation. In the 3rd project, an efficient topology control protocol will be designed, simulated in large networks using Opnet, and implemented and tested in the lab, for a mobile ad-hoc network of laptop and palm computers. Moreover, a distributed topology control mechanism will be designed that assigns a transmission power to every wireless node such that the resulting topology is strongly connected and the total energy consumed is minimized. This last project addresses topology control in mobile ad-hoc networks needed, for example, in proactive routing protocols. A new energy-efficient mechanism proposed, the Hitch-hiking model, addresses this topology control problem. Exploring the advantage offered by this model, successfully decoding a packet by combining partial receptions, the investigators will strive to minimize the total power expenditure. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: This infrastructure provides a research facility in a minority serving institution for students to conduct research in wireless and sensor networking areas.

Yet, addressing these challenges is becoming increasingly important as an ever larger fraction of the world's infrastructure comes to rely upon networked systems. Challenges faced by networked systems include failures, lack of fate-sharing among sys-tem components, highly variable communication patterns, race conditions, difficulty in reproducing bugs, asynchrony, security concerns, etc. While the advent of higher-level programming languages such as Java has raised the level of abstraction and eased this burden, most programmers still face the task of reinventing the appropriate techniques for dealing with asynchronous, failure-prone network environments known by a handful of elite programmers.<br\/><br\/>This proposal is exploring the design and implementation of a high-level language and runtime environment for building and operating robust, high-performance, and highly-available global-scale distributed systems. Target applications include Internet-scale routing protocols, planetary-scale network testbeds, and computational Grids. This work aims to holistically support the entire distributed system life-cycle from design to de-ployment and operation. The overall goals of this work are to effect a qualitative shift in: i) the time required to build, debug, and deploy robust distributed systems, ii) the ease and accuracy of translating high-level policy to low-level system specifications and con-figurations, and iii) the ability to compare the utility of competing systems architectures in a fair and consistent manner. <br\/><br\/>Dr. Brett D.

Furthermore, today's software products are artifacts of great complexity and variety, so great care must be taken in defining the format and content of such communication. Typically, however, the process of sharing knowledge between developer, customer, end user, and other stakeholders is discussed very little in undergraduate CISE education.<br\/><br\/>The proposed project seeks to enhance the education of undergraduate software engineering students in three ways: enlightening them about the needs and knowledge of other stakeholders, empowering them to engage in active communication with these stakeholders, and enabling them to communicate precisely and effectively. Curricular materials will draw from results from research in technical communication, using scenarios to draw end users and other traditionally marginalized stakeholders into the development process. The project will also use new software engineering tools and methodologies for documenting requirements and design. Problem frames will be used to structure and analyze software problems, and Abstract State Machines will be used for design documentation, prototyping, and verification.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual merit. This project brings together experts in technical communication and computer science to generate novel approaches to software engineering education. The material drawn from current software engineering research has not yet been brought into the classroom to any significant extent. The implementation and evaluation of the new curricular materials are to be performed in a variety of settings, by faculty members active in research and experienced in undergraduate education.<br\/><br\/>Broader impact. The curricular enhancements proposed in this project will help to produce more effective software engineers and better software. Training in careful, intensive communication with customers and users will increase customer satisfaction through greater usability and fewer defects. Instilling a discipline of literate, precise documentation will foster understanding among developers and simplify maintenance.<br\/><br\/>In addition, the proposed project will enliven the CISE curriculum and equip future software engineers with useful skills. Empowering students to participate in active communication will make them more engaged in their profession and less prone to frustration and burnout. The focus on real software problems will attract those students who prefer \"computing with a purpose\" and become disillusioned with the usual computer-centrism of CISE education. Recent studies have indicated that many female students fit this description, and that providing the motivation of realistic applications may help recruit and retain more women in CISE disciplines.","title":"CRCD\/EI: Speaking of Software: Integrating Communication and Documentation Techniques Into An Undergraduate Software Engineering Curriculum","awardID":"0417548","effectiveDate":"2004-08-15","expirationDate":"2007-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1709","name":"CISE EDUCAT RES & CURRIC DEVEL"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}}],"PIcoPI":["530960","528844","343421"],"PO":["521045"]},"93556":{"abstract":"CNS-0406336<br\/><br\/>The goal of this project is to advance methods for understanding the performance of scientific applications.

The sound scattering layer around the Hawaiian Islands is known as the mesopelagic boundary community (MBC) of micronekton comprising of small fishes, shrimps, and squids. This layer, like most deep-scattering layers, undergoes vertical migration. However, the Hawaiian boundary's migration also has a large horizontal component that is predictable along some coastlines. The project team will characterize the acoustic environment of the mesopelagic boundary community by performing 1) multi-frequency acoustic backscatter measurements at multiple grazing angles at different portions of the layer to account for differences in density and layer thickness, 2) acoustic, video and oceanographic measurements to estimate density and species and the relationship of oceanographic conditions at the same locations of the backscatter measurements, 3) acoustic and chlorophyll a measurements to estimate zooplankton and phytoplankton abundance and density at the locations of the backscatter measurements, 4) island scale spatial and temporal distribution of the mesopelagic boundary sound scattering layer at various locations around an island, with Oahu serving as a model for other islands in temperate and tropical Pacific.

For this purpose, existing forecasting techniques are leveraged to develop an approach for forecasting a sequence of workloads for a future time interval based on the data access pattern. These applications operate in two phases: off-line compression and on-line query evaluation. In the first phase, an access pattern is extracted from a sequence of accessed data elements mapped from the queries in a log, and is used to forecast a workload for each subinterval of a given future time interval. This generates a sequence of workloads. The workload information is then used to compress the data elements targeted for each subinterval. The compressed data elements are then stored on disk and, at run-time, loaded and translated into a main memory data structure needed for query evaluation in each subinterval. These steps of forecast, compression, and loading combined directly influence the trade-off between the approximate query result accuracy and query speed, thereby necessitating an optimization. The research will have immediate impacts in application areas needing the approximate query evaluation abilities of DBMSs, particularly those needing to use limited system resources effectively through workload forecasting. Furthermore, the developed techniques will have impacts in various fields of science and engineering by enabling efficient and effective utilization of limited resources based on forecasted workload.","title":"A Framework for Optimal Approximate Query Evaluation based on Workload Forecasting","awardID":"0415023","effectiveDate":"2004-08-01","expirationDate":"2010-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":["339916","122236","560697","427499"],"PO":["469867"]},"94559":{"abstract":"National Science Foundation<br\/>Distributed Systems Research <br\/>CISE\/CNS<br\/><br\/><br\/>ABSTRACT<br\/>PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0411043<br\/>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Srisa-an, Witawas<br\/>INSTITUTION: Building Scalable and Adaptive Garbage Collector for Server Systems<br\/>PROPOSAL TITLE: University of Nebraska-Lincoln<br\/><br\/>Industry observers have predicted that application servers will become a 21 billion dollars per year business by the end of 2007 as more companies deploy web services to make applications or information available across the Internet. Object-oriented languages are currently the choice for the development of those applications. Object-oriented languages such as Java and computing platform such Microsoft .NET have adopted garbage collec-tion as the way to manage dynamic memory. However, this adoption poses at least two significant challenges: (1) server applications are multithreaded and are designed for mul-tiprocessor systems and (2) unlike desktop applications, the workloads and resources available for server systems can vary tremendously.<br\/><br\/>This research addresses these issues by introducing a novel garbage collection system that can efficiently and dynamically respond to the specific needs and challenges of server applications. The proposed garbage collection scheme is fully scalable and thread-safe. It also discriminates between local and remote objects so that differentiated collec-tion strategies can be implemented according to locality.

Towards this goal, most past research focused on in-creasing the mean time between security breaches by improving methods to de-tect and prevent attacks. However, there is another alternative, which is the approach that the Repairable Data System (RDS) project takes: reduce the time required to restore a system back to normal order after it is compromised. More specifically, a repairable data system can quickly restart itself after an intrusion and eliminate those and only those side effects directly or indirectly left by the intrusion. <br\/><br\/>The key design issues in building repairable data systems are (1) how to log all updates so that every update is undoable, and (2) how to track the dependen-cies among updates so that all the updates affected by an attack can be identi-fied and erased. The RDS project develops novel techniques to solve these two problems in the context of network file servers and relational DBMS servers. The main result of this project is expected to be a reusable implementation framework for adding a fast repair mechanism to existing network file servers and DBMS servers without requiring any modifications to their internals The fast repair mechanism added drastically shortens the time taken by and im-proves the accuracy of the post-intrusion repair process. Therefore, this tech-nology renders existing information systems intrusion-tolerant in that the im-pact of an intrusion is diminished to the point of a transient system outage.

However, as computing scales to levels never seen before, it also becomes extremely data intensive and I\/O intensive. Thus, I\/O is becoming a major bottleneck, thereby slowing the expected pace of scientific discovery and analysis of data. Furthermore, in order to cope with larger problems and data sizes, models and applications are being designed to be dynamic in nature. That is, the applications are dynamic both in terms of their computation patterns as well as data access patterns. Due to the complexities of systems and applications, it is, therefore, very important to address research issues and develop dynamic techniques at the level of runtime systems and compilers to scale I\/O in the right proportions. <br\/><br\/>Technical Merit:<br\/><br\/>The objectives of this project are to design and develop next generation software techniques to address the data, I\/O, and storage bottlenecks for large-scale scientific applications. Particularly, this project aims to investigate dynamic runtime and compilation techniques for scalable I\/O optimizations for largescale systems. Another important aspect will be to drive these optimizations by learning and characterizing performance of I\/O and data accesses, and subsequently using those to develop rules that will be used by dynamic runtime and compilation systems to enable high-performance I\/O. Current state-of-the-art compiler support for I\/O-intensive applications is tremendously lacking. Runtime needs of many large-scale I\/O-intensive applications can benefit a lot from a robust dynamic compilation and linking infrastructure. The specific objectives of this project are:<br\/><br\/>.

To this end, the PI will conduct a three-phase social science study identifying and comparing the work practices of more and less effective FLOSS development teams. The conceptual basis for the study derives from Hackman's model of work team effectiveness, and builds on the PI's prior work involving coordination theory and collective mind to extend Hackman's model by further elaborating team practices relevant to software development. In light of the published literature on shared mental models (collective mind theory in particular), the PI will focus his attention on actions that develop and exhibit shared understandings. Coordination theory suggests identifying tasks, interdependences among tasks and resources and the coordination mechanisms that are adopted. During Phase I, the PI will conduct a census of FLOSS projects in order to identify development teams of interest and concepts and relationships that seem promising for further in-depth study. During Phase II, he will conduct an in-depth multiple case study of approximately 8 distributed FLOSS development teams, to test and extend the model developed in the proposal. During Phase III, he will collect and analyze data on hundreds of teams using the metrics and tools developed in Phase II, in order to generalize those findings. Phase III will also include a developer survey. Data considered will include project and developer demographics, interaction logs, code, interviews, observation and participant observation. Data will be analyzed to describe software development practices and processes, team social networks, and shared mental models of developers. Throughout all phases of the project, the research will be guided by an advisory board of FLOSS developers to ensure relevance and to help promote diffusion of findings into practice.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: The project will contribute to advancing knowledge and understanding of FLOSS development, by identifying the effective practices for FLOSS development, an increasingly important approach to software development.

Findings from the study may also be used to enhance the way information and communication technologies (ICT) are used to support distance education or for scientific collaboration.

The latter is particularly relevant from the standpoint of national security as many data encryption schemes remain secure based on the difficulty of factoring large integer keys. Currently, we do not know how to build a quantum computer that is large enough that the promises of increased computational power can be realized. Of the many physical systems under development for potential use as quantum processors, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is the furthest advanced. NMR exploits atomic nuclei that exist in spin states of \"up\" and \"down\". These spin states can be manipulated using pulsed magnetic fields to produce quantum logic gates and implement quantum algorithms. To date, several types of manipulations and algorithms have been demonstrated for spin bearing molecules in solution using liquid-state NMR. There are significant benefits, however, to performing QIP in static single crystal solids. In particular, the speed of a quantum algorithm can be increased by 2-3 orders of magnitude by taking advantage of interactions between nuclear spins that are inherently larger in solids. As well, single crystal solids are compatible with low temperatures, which can substantially increase sensitivity and address fundamental questions of state initialization and scalability. Indeed, because of increased speed, potentially larger processors, and better sensitivity, solid-state NMR has been tapped for next-generation QIP. Recently our group was the first to report experiments on a three-qubit NMR quantum information processor, using a static single-crystal of isotopically labeled glycine (H215N13CH213COOH) (Journal of Chemical Physics 119(3), 1643-1649 (2003)). Under this research program, we propose to develop new materials and methods for next-generation single crystal solid-state NMR QIP, seeking to extend the size and power of quantum processors and mapping out important physical parameters that define this technology. In the process, a number of graduate, postdoctoral, and undergraduate students will be trained in state-of-the techniques of both chemistry and physics, enabling a strong technological base to support the future needs of both industrial and government research laboratories.","title":"QnTM: Quantum Information Processing in Single Crystal Solids with NMR","awardID":"0432186","effectiveDate":"2004-08-15","expirationDate":"2007-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1705","name":"BIOLOGY & INFORMATION TECHNOLO"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7353","name":"EMERGING MODELS & TECHNOLOGIES"}}],"PIcoPI":["369751","512600"],"PO":["521045"]}}
