This research is motivated by the fact that reliable extraction, representation, and incorporation of some prior shape information can greatly reduce the segmentation error resulting from image noise. Three important problems will be addressed and integrated to effectively explore shape information for medical image segmentation: shape representation, shape correspondence, and shape deformation. The shape representation is to compactly describe a shape in terms of a set of landmark points. The shape correspondence is to establish landmark-based correspondence among a set of shape samples. <br\/>The shape deformation is to first construct a shape template that captures representative shape characteristics of a particular object class, and then use it to delineate an object of the same class from a new image. <br\/>Intellectual Merits: This research studies the shape modeling method from a unique systematic perspective. While previous researches usually focus on a particular problem in shape modeling, we will investigate all three interrelated key problems, i.e., shape representation, shape correspondence, and shape deformation, in an integrated and unified framework, specifically for medical image segmentation. Under this unified framework, we develop novel methods to address most important issues in each of these three problems. In the shape representation, we will incorporate our resolution-independent feature extraction method to estimate key shape parameters such as position, tangent direction, and curvature more accurately. This will provide a representation format that is accurate, compact, and flexible in describing a group of shape instances. In the shape correspondence, we will develop global and local correspondence methods to choose landmarks based on the following criteria: (1) simple shape representation, (2) small representation error, and (3) optimal inter-shape landmark correspondence. An advanced network-flow technique will be used to integrate these three measures into a new unified formulation. In the shape deformation, we will develop effective shape-learning techniques based on a group of well-corresponded training samples. The techniques employ more general and <br\/>accurate probability distribution models than simple Gaussian distributions. Based on the models, <br\/>we will further develop our shape deformation method to deal with important issues like <br\/>algorithm robustness and topology preservation. <br\/>Broad Impacts: Fast growth of medical imaging industry provides us tremendous amount <br\/>of data in many forms like MRI, CT, PET, cryosection, microscopic, etc. It is urgent to develop <br\/>advanced information technology to convert those medical data into useful information. Among <br\/>them, geometric shape information is of particular importance as they are widely used in clinical <br\/>diagnoses. The proposed research will greatly facilitate the shape information exploration from <br\/>medical images and provide physician and radiologists new and powerful computational tools. In <br\/>the long term, this research will further intensify the current efforts to bridge the gap between information technology and medical applications. Furthermore, the proposed research can be applied to many other applications like video tracking and biometrics that shares the same problems as in shape exploration from medical images. This research also provides many educational contributions. We will integrate the medical image processing into a series of image processing and computer vision courses in the University of South Carolina (USC). This research will also actively contribute to the K-12 education in the state by assisting the NSF Bridges for Engineering Education Program awarded to the University and participating in the summer mentor program by the South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics. Biomedical engineering has been selected as one of three main focus areas for research at USC. Thus, our research effort will directly contribute to the university wide efforts. In particular, our effort can be integrated with the neuro-imaging initiative at the Psychology Department and the new Center for Colon Cancer Research.","title":"Shape Exploration for Medical Applications --- From Representation, Correspondence, Deformation to Image Segmentation","awardID":"0312861","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1994","name":"BIOINFORMATICS PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":["486288","451161"],"PO":["563727"]},"81328":{"abstract":"Emerging directions in computing are likely to dramatically increase storage demands. Traditional drivers for storage-large databases, scientific data sets and general personal and institutional information needs-continue to increase, while new elements impose even greater, more complex needs. Such new elements include \"collected\" materials, i.e., digital libraries of textual documents, images, and video, as well as streaming data from widely distributed and widely varied networked sensors integrated with the physical world. With the continued miniaturization of CMOS technology, this last category may increase in scale at a rate similar to Moore's law, rather than being limited by the pace of human creative activities, and it will feed into higher level processing and storage.<br\/><br\/>In anticipation of these developments, we propose to provide a set of storage services targeted at supporting research projects with profound current and future storage needs. In particular, we propose<br\/><br\/>1. experimenting with providing low-cost petabyte-scale generic \"object storage\", via the use of commodity components and tape-less (i.e., disk-to-disk) backup<br\/>2. providing a fast disk cache for a scientific cluster computing facility, to support large computations that require significant local storage<br\/>3. providing a few thousand environmental sensors to support experimenting with collecting and storing large sensor-derived environmental data sets.<br\/><br\/><br\/>The object storage experiment is central to this project. The cost of providing storage to users today is dominated by administrative costs, and, left to its own devices, the situation will only grow worse. For example, IT support organizations report that the cost of storage hardware accounts for only 10-15% of the fully loaded cost of providing storage, which is dominated by the cost of backups. In addition, the higher-end servers used to dispense bytes reliably are much more expensive than generic low-end servers.<br\/><br\/>Our goal is to provide a generic storage service that offers attractive \"enterprise\" qualities, but at a cost that tracks advances in hardware, and which can grow to a potentially much larger scale. We plan to address the issues of availability and durability by storing objects on multiple, inexpensive servers, some geographically distributed, and without tapes or extensive operations personnel.

The process of finding implicit representations is also known as implicitization, which has applications in areas such as computer aided geometric design (CAGD), visualization and solid modeling. The approach is to utilize a novel method for implicitization that is both reliable and efficient. A reliable method is a method that theoretically never fails to give a correct answer. An efficient method is a method that has a better complexity or a more reasonable running time and consumes less memory. An efficient and reliable implicitization algorithm will facilitate the analysis needed in the design of curves and surfaces. For example, it can be used for finding the intersection of surfaces, to verify whether or not a point lies on a surface, etc. Software products from this research project are being distributed to researchers who are interested in using the new results. <br\/><br\/>The investigation uses a deterministic Groebner walk method to convert a parametric representation of a surface into its implicit form. For rational parametric surfaces, the author uses a different approach to deal with base points in that the calculation of a Groebner basis for the starting cone is no longer needed. This approach improves the efficiency of algorithms because the usual calculation of the implicit representation, which often consumes a lot of time and memory space, is replaced by a sequence of small calculations along the walking path and then lift the results using linear transformations. A second task is to reduce the number of terms of the intermediate polynomials and find criteria for detecting unnecessary reduction. Experimental results with the deterministic Groebner walk conversion method show that most of the time for implicitization is used for reducing the minimal bases after lifting, but this entails many unnecessary computations. This approach detects only necessary reductions thus greatly improving the efficiency of algorithms and significantly reducing the memory space.","title":"SGER: Efficient Groebner Basis Computation for Finding Implicit Representations of Geometric Objects","awardID":"0333746","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2005-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":["563805"],"PO":["321058"]},"85519":{"abstract":"This project, developing a scalable and incrementally upgradeable Beowulf cluster system with high-speed connectivity, supports computational experimentation at a RUI institution.

The combined representations lead to lightweight preservation checks, a crucial part of keeping product-line verification tractable. The work includes both theoretical work and<br\/>experimental validation. The project both contributes to advancing an important software development methodology and narrows the gap between the areas of software engineering and computer-aided<br\/>verification. The work involves undergraduate students and will have impact through classroom contact at several levels.","title":"Collaborative Research: Compositional Verification of Software Product Lines as Open Systems","awardID":"0305834","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}}],"PIcoPI":["485803"],"PO":["564388"]},"91547":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>0325390<br\/>Robert Nowak<br\/>William Marsh Rice University<br\/><br\/>This project addresses the longstanding and difficult problem of detecting and classifying spatially distributed network anomalies from multiple monitoring sites. To characterize baseline vs. anomalous behavior of the Internet requires deployment of collaborative data collection, anomaly detection and pattern recognition for complex largescale systems. The project combines the forces of leading researchers in three complementary disciplines: (i) networking and data collection; (ii) statistical data analysis and signal processing; (iii) decentralized decision-making. The research goes well beyond the state-of-the art anomaly detection for centrally administered networks. In particular tools and practical data sharing algorithms are being developed for detecting coordinated intrusions, distributed denial of service attacks, and quality-of-service degradations in decentralized networks such as the Internet. The project also includes activities with broader impact including: creation of a public network anomaly database, K-12 educational outreach, and university-industry collaborations.<br\/>The research approach is based on a modular and distributed monitoring paradigm that is organized into a three level hierarchy: local level measurement of data from servers, routers and switches; intermediate level data analysis and processing of end-to-end traffic measurements, summary statistics and alarms transmitted from the local level; and upper level decision-making and processing of information transmitted from the intermediate level. This modular structure is scalable to large networks of monitoring sites. However, this structure also imposes constraints on data analysis, which requires development of new approaches. Three approaches are being pursued: distributed spatio-temporal data analysis using wavelets over graphs; event detection and classification using distributed pattern analysis and learning; and multi-site event correlation using discrete event dynamical systems and decentralized stochastic systems.","title":"Collaborative ITR\/CSE: Modular Strategies for Internetwork Monitoring","awardID":"0353079","effectiveDate":"2003-09-02","expirationDate":"2013-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"I184","name":"National Security Agency"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"I264","name":"Central Intelligence Agency"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"T553","name":"CIA-ADMIN BREAKDOWN"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"T790","name":"CIA-TEMPORAL DYNAMICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["518179"],"PO":["564898"]},"83704":{"abstract":"ITR: Reliable Distributed Programming with Speculations<br\/><br\/>Abstract<br\/><br\/>It has been well established that the United States needs better<br\/>programming technology to assure the safety and reliability of the<br\/>nation's software infrastructure. The National Research Council, the<br\/>President's commission on critical infrastructure protection, and the<br\/>PITAC report reach similar conclusions: that the nation depends on<br\/>fragile software, and technologies for building reliable software are<br\/>inadequate. To address these problems, this research develops a new<br\/>programming model, called speculations, for ensuring software<br\/>reliability.<br\/><br\/>A speculation is a computation that depends on an assumption that may<br\/>be difficult or impossible to verify prior to evaluating the<br\/>computation. If the assumption is later found to be false, the<br\/>computation is rolled back. Speculations are especially useful in<br\/>distributed systems, where failures are inevitable: the network may<br\/>fail, processors may fail, and the code itself may have errors. In<br\/>this new approach, speculations are used to wrap potentially unsafe<br\/>computations. If a fault occurs, the program is restored to a<br\/>well-known program state where the fault can be easily resolved.<br\/><br\/>The research develops the theory and design automation tools for<br\/>speculations in three parts: first, the programming language theory is<br\/>expanded to provide a basis for speculation; second, the theory is<br\/>used to implement compiler and operating system extensions that<br\/>automate the support for speculations; and third, speculations are<br\/>used to develop new distributed communication protocols and<br\/>algorithms.

The lab will ensure that our research and students address issues of both immediate and long-term relevance as we move to an Internet-based world. <br\/>The Internet has changed the face of computer science. Concepts such as e-commerce, grid computing, peer-to-peer programming, and file sharing provide new directions. Old problems, such as security and authentication, have become more complex and at the same time more important. Other problems, such as cooperative work, databases, and distributed systems, have changed scale so dramatically that one now talks of millions of concurrent users. <br\/>It is difficult to study or teach this new face of computer science using old tools and environments. Many of the complexities and problems occur only when they are tackled at \"Internet scale\", that is, when there are thousands of simultaneous users, millions of potential users, widely distributed systems, multiple servers, unreliable networks, strong security and privacy concerns, hackers, and the like. Modern research must be driven by and shown to work in the real world on tomorrow's problems. Moreover, students can encounter and appreciate the difficulties inherent in modern Internet-based systems only by working with real systems.<br\/>The proposed laboratory for experimenting with Internet-scale applications will be suitable for both state- of-the-art research and instruction. For research, it will provide a framework in which ideas can be tested at Internet scale. Such a laboratory will give researchers insights into what the real problems are and how they might be addressed, and will also allow them to validate new approaches. For teaching, the laboratory will show students the problems that arise and techniques used when building applications at Internet scales and.will let us offer courses that better prepare students for real-world programming and research.<br\/>The laboratory will be used in a variety of research projects. Pervasive programming involves building a common programming framework for dealing with web services, peer-to-peer computing, and grid computing in an open-source environment. Aurora* tackles the problems of large-scale network and stream- based data management. Language research addresses the semantics of web applications. Covalent objects provide a means for object sharing at Internet scales. Prooflets are a simple and efficient way to authenticate large numbers of small data items across the web. In addition, we will use the facility as a laboratory in both undergraduate and graduate courses.<br\/>Broader Impact: The laboratory will have an impact beyond the immediate research and teaching needs of our department. We will use the laboratory for attracting students to computer science by offering it as a vehicle for both undergraduate and graduate research projects and by making it the focal point of new entry-level courses. The laboratory will be used by a variety of outreach projects at Brown including Artemis, a program for middle-school girls, and TeachScheme!, a program for high-school teachers. The laboratory will also serve as a bridge between academia and industry, providing a framework whereby academics can study and work on industrial-scale Internet problems. Finally, we hope the laboratory will serve as a model for future computer science education and research and we will actively encourage its use by outside researchers.","title":"RI: The Brown Internet Computing Laboratory","awardID":"0303577","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["448702","554181","521367","531608","519555"],"PO":["297837"]},"85718":{"abstract":"This project seeks to develop a comprehensive research and education program in the area of computational<br\/>methods and simulations of physical systems described by high order Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).

Contemporary engineering practitioners require an integrated understanding of high-speed system engineering that may surpass the traditional focus developed in undergraduate curricula. Typical engineering students focus on well-established subjects such as power, VLSI, materials, electronic devices, opto-electronics, networking, communication, embedded systems and programming. This project proposes that a set of courses (presented in a track called High-Speed System Engineering) be offered as a part of engineering students' curriculum to train them in essentials needed in the workforce. The curriculum track offers undergraduate students an opportunity to understand the issues of networking and high-speed interconnections by exposing them to design and practical issues and by infusing the results of research into their classes. Research transfer is done using case studies that both shed light on basic principles and also provide students with exciting applications to learn from. This project builds on the successes of two related activities at this institution: a high-speed electronics and VLSI laboratory (Carver Lab) and the dependable computing and networking laboratory (DCNL). The classes developed for this project teach the fundamentals and relationships between the related topics, and also integrate research findings to motivate students' understanding of the fundamentals and emphasize the importance of the subject. In addition, students are trained in measurement techniques and are required to conduct typical measurements themselves. The program has a strong laboratory component to enhance students' understanding of current measurement technology. The courses in the High Speed System Engineering track include: 1) Fundamentals of Measurements and Instrumentation: Electronics, digital, RF, microwave, and optical measurement and instrumentation laboratory covering the basics of measurement, the known measurement methodologies for digital and analog systems, and the details of the requirements needed to measure in the microwave to the optical domain, 2) Advanced Robust: Issues, techniques and tools used in design of future systems in the terahertz range and beyond and current and future system considerations relying on robustness, fault tolerance, and secure systems. 3) High-speed Hybrid Systems: Optical\/electronics hybrid-interconnect systems including compatibility problems associated with optical and electronic based systems and EM compatibility and immunity. 4) High-speed System Characterization: Concepts applied in high-speed system integration and measurement. The design and characterization criteria for high-speed systems are different from those of DC and low frequencies systems. The goal of this class is to get students familiar with high-speed issues.

Use of an equilibrium relationship implies that time scales of dynamics between those variables are short (fast) relative to time scales associated with other system dynamics. Practical guidance in the soil science literature regarding time scales for equilibrium between Pc and S indicates that an equilibrium relationship may not be justified. An alternative formulation has been developed in which a dynamic, time-dependent relationship between Pc and S is introduced. Initial investigations of data reported in the literature indicate that dynamics in the Pc-S relationship exist, and associated analysis shows that those dynamics can be captured within this dynamic formulation. While this formulation is promising, there are a number of significant aspects that need to be investigated, from the fundamental nature of the underlying dynamics, to the ways in which the dynamics change as a function of spatial averaging scale and degree of heterogeneity. To address the nature of these dynamics, three hypotheses are posed, which form the basis for the proposed work:<br\/>Hypothesis 1: Viscous Effects at the Pore Scale lead to a Dynamic Capillary Pressure. <br\/>Hypothesis 2: Dynamic Capillary Pressure effects are progressively more important as averaging length scale increases and as the degree of subscale heterogeneity increases.<br\/>Hypothesis 3: The dynamic coefficient in the new formulation is not constant but a well-defined function of saturation Sw.<br\/>These hypotheses will be tested using computational models of multiphase flow across a range of length scales. If these hypotheses are true, then the way that two-phase flow problems have been described and modeled for more than 50 years will need to be modified, with a fundamentally new parameter introduced, and a concomitant new way of thinking about these systems.<br\/> This project will have broader impacts beyond the specific porous media research. In addition to usual development of graduate students, the project will include collaborations with colleagues at the University of Bergen (Norway) and the Technical University of Delft (Netherlands), including exchanges of graduate students between those institutions and Princeton University. In addition, an international workshop will be convened at Princeton during the third year of the project, to discuss the specific topic of new constitutive relationships for multi-phase flow with a focus on dynamic capillary pressure.","title":"An Investigation of Dynamic Capillary Pressure in Two-Phase Porous Media Flows","awardID":"0309607","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"06","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES             ","abbr":"GEO"},"div":{"id":"0603","name":"Division of EARTH SCIENCES","abbr":"EAR"},"pgm":{"id":"1579","name":"HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES"}}],"PIcoPI":["422799"],"PO":["376131"]},"81748":{"abstract":"The Stabilized Explicit-Implicit Domain Decomposition (SEIDD) is a class of globally non-iterative and non-overlapping Domain Decomposition (DD) algorithms for solving parabolic equations on parallel computers.

These aspects include experimentation toward understanding, optimally utilizing, and improving the Web. The facility has enabled researchers to try out various hypothesis and techniques for indexing and modeling WWW information. The system's highly configurable crawlers collect a large number of Web pages, storing them locally for testing novel algorithms, such as ranking, filtering, or Web linkage mapping on the collection. The current WebBase is underpowered; for example, the crawling speeds are limited by CPU performance (retrieved pages are compressed before being stored), and often by virtual memory space. Removing these two bottlenecks will enable sustaining a higher Web sample rate and covering larger areas of the Web. An upgraded testbed, developed by scaling up in size and processing speed of the current hardware facilities of an existing system called WebBase, will be used to study and evaluate different Web crawling, archive refreshing, data compression, and storage and indexing techniques. Moreover, the project investigates problems related to data extraction, semantic search, searching for non-text objects, access control, cross-temporal analysis, and mining patterns or relationships between entities.

In the former case, the main computer provides both cycles and file storage; in the latter, the desktop computers provide the cycles and some of the file storage, while the file server provides more stable file storage. This approach does not scale well in universities where space and other capital improvements are nearly insurmountable barriers (and even if funded, take years to implement). The quality of educational labs for computer science students deteriorates due to these space constraints, economy of<br\/>scale requirements, and to the rate at which laboratory computers become obsolete.<br\/><br\/>A survey of our undergraduate students shows that they typically use their own computer for university tasks rather than using the lab computers.

This approach shifts the \"rapidly aging\" aspects of computers to end users. These users can decide whether or not they desire newer, faster equipment to use with the infrastructure, or if they prefer to avoid acquisition to save money. The university saves space by providing a cafe -like atmosphere where students can use their equipment, rather than providing rooms full of rapidly-aging computers. More importantly, the infrastructure provides a robust and configurable infrastructure where it is possible to ensure that students have access to exactly the right tools (and software versions) for a particular course.

The results of these efforts have shared a number of traits: system size and complexity, possible distribution across desktop platforms, focus on modeling and analysis before implementation, accompanying development environments, explicit software architectures, and so forth. The resulting software development paradigm has been referred to as programming-in-the-large (PitL). A new set of challenges has arisen with the proliferation of small, inexpensive, heterogeneous, resource-constrained, possibly embedded, highly-distributed, and highly-mobile computing platforms. While a number of the individual challenges may bear similarity to those addressed by PitL, their combination and overall novelty can be described more appropriately as programming-in-the-small-and-many (Prism).<br\/>The proposed project intends to address the challenges of Prism. The project's focus is at the level of<br\/>software application engineering. That is, the project will utilize advances in lower level software technologies (operating systems, optimized compilation, (wireless) networking, and data compression) as it<br\/>addresses the goal of developing understandings, principles, frameworks, methods, mechanisms, and tools<br\/>that will support efficient, scalable, reliable, robust, and, above all, highly adaptable software applications in the Prism setting. The project will focus on four key objectives:<br\/>1. develop an effective design methodology, accompanying software models, and flexible, incremental software<br\/>analysis techniques;<br\/>2. develop technology to carry the design approach forward to implementation in a heterogeneous, highly<br\/>distributed, mobile, and resource constrained setting;<br\/>3. develop execution-time solutions in support of (continuous) dynamic system evolution, (re)deployment,<br\/>mobility, and graceful degradation;<br\/>4. validate the approach through series of experiments to quantify its key aspects, as well as through applications in three specific problem domains.<br\/>The project will build upon the emerging body of research on software architectures in providing a comprehensive methodology for software development in-the-small-and-many. In particular, it will investigate the potential role and impact of software architectural styles (recurring structural, behavioral, and interaction patterns across systems) in providing a basis for the design methodology and incremental architectural analysis. Component-based frameworks and software connectors (explicit architectural abstractions embodying component interactions) will form the likely basis of the architecture implementation and execution solutions. Since it is unrealistic to assume that all applications in the Prism setting will have the same modeling and implementation needs, the project will provide configurable architectural style and implementation frameworks, with guidelines for instantiating these frameworks into specific styles and style-based implementation\/execution platforms.","title":"ITR: Architectural Support for Programming-in-the-Small-and-Many","awardID":"0312780","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["551145"],"PO":["564388"]},"90957":{"abstract":"In the last two decades, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been addressed using a pattern matching paradigm with a top-down characterization of acoustic, pronunciation, and language models as an integrated finite state network. Although there have been significant advances over the years, the progress has begun to slow recently; however, the current state-of-the-state has yet to rival human speech recognition capability. This is mainly due to: (1) the inability to obtain a complete specification of all the knowledge sources needed to solve the ASR problem in a top-down manner, and (2) the ASR robustness problem. <br\/><br\/>This project is developing and evaluating an auditory perception approach to ASR that is both knowledge-based and data-driven.

The project is investigating the feasibility of feature detection and knowledge integration algorithms that are foundational to the approach and is creating a plug-and-play platform to facilitate cooperation between broad speech science and speech processing communities. <br\/><br\/>This research should facilitate a better understanding of the link between auditory perception and ASR, provide educational opportunities to students and researchers to better understand speech fundamentals, challenge the signal processing community to develop new speech feature detection algorithms, and pave the way for a common software and evaluation platform to facilitate collaborative ASR research.","title":"SGER: Exploring New Auditory Perception Based Approaches to ASR","awardID":"0350408","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2005-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7274","name":"HUMAN LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["335186"],"PO":["565215"]},"90605":{"abstract":"This award supports a workshop on Science of Design for Information Systems (SDIS03), held in September 16 - 17, 2003, in Seattle, Washington, in conjunction with the NSF Information and Data Management Principal Investigators' Workshop (IDM03), to leverage the presence of many IDM03 attendees.

Surprisingly, today's wireless systems treat all the higher layer protocols of the network stack as invisible and irrelevant in the development of wireless standards (e.g., WCDMA, EDGE, and IEEE 802.11a). Future wireless networks must abandon this archaic viewpoint of separation, and must use cross-layer knowledge to enable the next generations of ubiquitous wireless applications. In fact, one of the major stumbling blocks to designing and deploying the new generation of wireless network services is the lack of sophisticated computational tools for end-to-end systems modeling and simulation. Next generation simulation environments must address both the fidelity of modeling needed for the channel and physical levels of the protocol hierarchy and, at the same time, interactively exploit these features<br\/>in software protocols employed at the higher layers. When such an approach is used, it becomes possible to create a powerful, accurate, end-to-end modeling environment for the development of the next generation of wireless data networks. This proposal will develop the first academic end-to-end multi-layer simulator and emulator for wireless networks. Montage -an integrated protocol development environment -will support the evolutionary design, development, and test of wireless network protocols. It will enable wireless and ad-hoc mobile network researchers and system operators across the country to design, develop, and analyze wireless hardware, network protocols, middleware algorithms, and network applications in a single integrated public-domain environment. Key research issues addressed in this proposal include a unified multi-modeling methodology (simulation + emulation + direct code execution), algorithms for smart scheduling, building a dynamic compositional environment, and incorporating sophisticated performance models of various network protocol layers. Montage thus addresses both the TPES (Technology for Performance Engineered Systems) and the CADDS (Complex Application Design and Support Systems) goals of the NSF Next Generation Software (NGS) program. Development of Montage drives development of new methods and techniques for integration of complex systems. It is simply not possible to create an integrated system from several existing and semantically complex systems on an ad hoc basis. The research tasks of this project derive from interfacing and integration of systems, which have quite different semantic bases, varied execution models, and span multiple levels of abstraction. One task is to design interface specification languages that will enable representation of the translations across the multiple semantics, execution models and levels of abstraction. Applying the interface language to interface and integrate the software systems, which together implement the Montage methodology, will be a major component of this research. As application case studies, this project will address key validation and design problems for large-scale ad-hoc wireless networks, as well as large commercial cellular networks that are transitioning from 2.5G to 3G. Today, these computational capabilities do not exist. <br\/>Broader Impacts: Montage will be made available as a public domain web portal with customized design scenario interfaces for network researchers, educators, and commercial carriers. Montage shall also serve as a national archive for measured network performance and as a repository of designs selected by the user community. Montage will enable researchers to setup virtual testbeds, validate their modeling, and design and test middleware algorithms for wireless networks of the future. The principal investigators have an excellent track record for creating valuable research products and learning materials for education and training purposes. Furthermore, the investigators have proven records for fostering economic growth by creating high-tech spinout companies.

Century\" Growing Strong, Moving On. <br\/><br\/>Girl Power 21st Century is a three-year project that addresses the need for early educational intervention to increase the number of women pursuing technical education and careers. The project is designed as a model collaboration between a higher education institution (Stony Brook University), a community organization (Suffolk County Girl Scouts Council), and a local school district (Riverhead School District) with a high proportion of minority and\/or lower income families. The current program builds on a successful four-year-old program, Girl Power: Growing Strong with Technology, and includes three modules for girls in grades 2 through 8. The current Beginner and Advanced Girl Power classes function as Module 1 for second- and third-graders, covering basic computer skills, web-building skills and technical vocabulary. <br\/><br\/>To bridge the technology education gap that currently exists between third grade and high school for our target population, two new modules have been designed for Girl Power 21st Century. Module 2 consists of a one-week Summer Technology Day Camp for fourth grade girls who have completed both classes in Module 1. This experience will provide more challenging technical and programming activities and will bridge into Module 3, Project Options, for girls in grades four through eight. The first phase of Project Options will be the development of an interactive website as a place for girls aged 8-14 to explore career options. In addition to the acquisition of technical skills related to web design, Project Options will provide girls with the opportunity to develop and enhance other skills, such as interviewing, online research, writing, filming, and digital photography. In the second phase of Project Options multiple cohorts of girls will maintain the website by creating new content and new formats, and updating old information. Older girls will become involved in mentoring younger girls and acting as mentors and teachers in the lab.","title":"ITWF: Girl Power 21st Century: Growing Strong, Moving On","awardID":"0305216","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1713","name":"WORKFORCE"}}],"PIcoPI":[213117,213118,"410652"],"PO":["564181"]},"83709":{"abstract":"The goal of this project is to improve the quality of text-to-speech synthesis. Text-to-speech synthesis is an increasingly more widely used technology that plays a core role in automated information access by telephone, and universal access for individuals with visual or other challenges, and educational software.<br\/><br\/>The project focuses on how humans perceive acoustic discontinuities in speech. Current text-to-speech synthesis technology operates by retrieving intervals of stored digitized speech from a database and splicing (\"concatenating\") them to form the output utterance. Unavoidably, there are acoustic discontinuities at the time points where the successive speech intervals meet. For reasons that are currently poorly understood, many of these acoustic discontinuities are not audible even when they seem large by any objective measure. This relative insensitivity of human hearing is the reason that concatenative synthesis works at all. However, conversely it also often occurs that seemingly small discontinuities are audible. These facts raise the scientific question of how one can construct an objective acoustic discontinuity measure that accurately predicts from the quantitative, acoustic properties of two to-be-concatenated speech intervals whether humans will hear a discontinuity.<br\/><br\/>This question is not only of interest for a better understanding of human hearing, but is also of immediate practical relevance. Many text-to-speech synthesis systems select speech intervals at run time from a large speech corpus. During selection, the systems search through the space of all possible sequences of speech intervals that can be used for the utterance and selects the sequence that has the lowest overall objective cost measure, such as the Euclidean distance between the final frame and initial frame of two successive intervals. However, research has already shown that this method and related methods do not predict well whether humans will hear a discontinuity. The current research, by being explicitly focused on perceptually optimized objective cost measures, will directly contribute to the perceptual accuracy of cost measures and hence to synthesis quality.","title":"ITR: Objective Methods for Predicting and Optimizing Synthetic Speech Quality","awardID":"0313383","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"V723","name":"NSA-HLT CENTER OF EXCEL PROJEC"}}],"PIcoPI":["483791"],"PO":["565215"]},"90915":{"abstract":"This project is focusing on a new branch of computational science, i.e. computational epidemiology, an interdisciplinary, small scale, exploratory, high risk research with relevance to national health.

There are now numerous pressing issues coming from the statistical, engineering and computer science communities resulting from their significant progress in learning theory that provide a unique opportunity and vast need for mathematicians to develop both theoretical concepts and computational tools to assist in this area of research. We propose to study several fundamental theoretical mathematical and computational problems crucial for the continued rapid development of learning theory. They include a further study and improvements of the F. Cucker and S. Smale theory of learning, the support vector machine (SVM) of V. Vapnik, the regression theory of T. Poggio, the deterministic approach of C. A. Micchelli for optimal estimation under uncertainty and the relationship between these important ideas. Among other things, we will be concerned with learning a function from other than function values, learning vector valued functions, learning the optimal information for learning a function and estimating the approximation error using notions of nonlinear widths of function classes which is useful for obtaining deterministic estimates that lead to statistical estimates for learning. We shall study efficient numerical solutions of second kind integral equations in high dimensions which come up in the study of the approximation error of Cucker and Smale. We will also focus upon the minimal norm interpolation approach to regression and SVM which is not emphasized much in the learning theory literature and use duality theory as a bridge to compare all of them. We shall also study the kernel density problem whose importance in learning theory has been recently described by T. Poggio, investigate how to choose a kernel from the data and consider probability density estimation problems which are useful in pattern recognition and speech recognition. We are also interested in the question of stability of learning algorithms and seek to construct kernels on complex spaces suitable for applications.<br\/><br\/>Our proposed research addresses a multitude of practical problems arising from the handling of massive amounts of data in high dimensional spaces.

The goals of this project are (a) to develop a highly effective and general framework for biological data clustering, which is applicable to a large class of biological data analysis problems; (b) to demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework as a general-purpose clustering tool, through application to four challenging biological data analysis problems; (c) to implement this clustering framework as a set of library functions, in a similar fashion to LINPACK\/LAPACK, with which other researchers can build their own clustering capabilities more efficiently; (d) to provide insight on several biological problems through clustering analysis; and (e) to train students\/postdocs how to build biological data analysis tools, using our clustering framework as a training ground. The foundation of our framework is a minimum spanning tree (MST) representation of a data set and its relationships with clustering. Our preliminary studies have revealed that (i) there is a natural connection between MSTs and the concept of clustering, which can help to reduce a multi-dimensional data clustering problem to a tree-partitioning problem; (ii) clustering problems with general objective functions, defined on (minimum spanning) trees, can be solved optimally and efficiently; and (iii) MSTs provide a natural framework for solving a more general class of clustering problems, i.e., extracting data clusters from a noisy background. Additional preliminary studies have also revealed that MSTs have such rich properties related to clustering that further investigation could lead to significantly more effective ways of clustering and analyzing biological data.

Biologists used to conduct their research in a relatively limited information space. Many IT advances, however, have changed the nature of their work. New data sources, such as genome sequences and DNA microarray experiments, have increased the amount of raw data, while the growth of research findings and subsequent knowledge have taxed the ability of biologists, like other scientists, to keep up with progress in their areas of interest. The tremendous growth in experimental data is accompanied by an overwhelming rate of publications describing new findings. Keeping up with the published literature is becoming a daunting task for researchers. Finding all and only the required information for any specific research task, within the immense body of literature is almost impossible, and advanced technology to assist in sorting through it is an immediate need.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit of this activity is that it will provide synergistic benefit for both the biology and IR communities. By creating standardized yet realistic information challenges, it will enable IR researchers to develop better tools for biologists than they could have working alone. As with most TREC endeavors, IR research itself will improve synergistically due to interaction among researchers working on common tasks created in conjunction with real-world end users.<br\/><br\/>This project will also have broader impacts. The project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching and learning. Discovery and understanding will ensue from the more robust experiments that can be used to evaluate systems emanating from this work, while teaching and learning will improve since many of the participating research groups are likely to work in academic settings where graduate and other students can take part. The infrastructure for research and education will be enhanced by the shared and public availability of the text retrieval resource produced by this project, allowing IR systems developers and biologists to better understand each other's work. It will also contribute tools to the growing \"cyberinfrastructure\" deemed necessary for optimal usage of IT in the new century.

While the diversity of available data presents an opportunity to attack this problem, it is accompanied by difficulties in harnessing and exploring data. This collaborative interdisciplinary, inter-institutional research project exploits the researchers' prior expertise on wrapper and mediator technology and apply domain specific semantic knowledge to this problem. The goal is the correct identification and complete characterization of scientific entities by exploring multiple data sources. This project will address three tasks: (1) Construction of a Semantic Map of biological data sources including unique identifiers; links between sources; attributes; and search and query; (2) Learning at the data source, schema, domain and instance level uses the concept of Identity Link to identify equivalent identifiers for the same instance, and (3) Learning the properties of physical links and paths that are implemented among multiple data sources. The topology of links (paths) based on their properties, and Link (Path) Equivalence is applied to the tasks of entity identity and characterization. The tools developed in this project will be accessible via the project Web site (http:\/\/www.umiacs.umd.edu\/research\/CLIP\/BFEnt02\/), and can be applied by biologists to support ongoing scientific investigations in cancer research and diabetes, resulting in a broad impact in medical research and treatment. The educational impact includes a course on data management solutions for bioinformatics researchers and a workshop on experiment planning using data sources for biologists.","title":"COLLABORATIVE PROPOSAL: Semantic Map of Biological Data Sources: Entity Identity and Path Characterization","awardID":"0222847","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}}],"PIcoPI":["543580"],"PO":["563727"]},"87281":{"abstract":"There is a growing need, especially in light of Homeland Security, for surveillance of our critical infrastructure, including road, water, electrical, and rail systems. There is an equally compelling concern for a high level of effectiveness among first responders to incidents that may be terrorist related, but could also be the result of weather events or hazardous spills. In both cases, there is an urgent need for high quality video-based surveillance, advanced specialized sensors and high bandwidth communications, which are portable, secure, reconfigurable and offer high availability. Such sensor-communication (SC) networks will be extensive, must be compatible with legacy communication infrastructure, and must be able to transport large quantities of data, which could involve Gb\/s data flows from systems of high-resolution cameras. They must be rapidly deployable, and provide in essence an instant communications infrastructure.<br\/><br\/>The use of free space laser communication links, here called optical wireless, is emerging as an important solution to this problem. It is their belief that autonomous optical wireless communication nodes (locations where data are generated or relayed) have the ability to meet the requirements of portability, security, reconfigurability and availability. Will provide the data rates required, do not interfere with existing RF mobile communications, and provide a bridge from where data are generated to the nearest optical fiber connection.<br\/><br\/>In this proposal it describe research on optical wireless in conjunction with other technologies to provide a robust, advanced SC network. A key focus is the development of autonomous (solar-powered) optical wireless transceivers, which have the ability to point and track, can handle continuous or bursty data, and can function in a dynamic, self-configuring network environment (instantaneous infrastructure). The ability of optical wireless communications to provide bursty data communication allows downloading of buffered data from moving nodes, mounted for example on rail cars, police vehicles, trucks, or barges. This permits dynamic adjustment of traffic flow within the communication network by intelligent exchange of detailed situation data between fixed and mobile nodes.<br\/><br\/>Propose to (1) develop the hardware and software for multiple-connected, reconfigurable, SC networks; and (2) test key concepts, in real network demonstrations within a large existing development program, the Capital Area Wireless Integrated Network (CapWIN), using interoperable data communications systems now being implemented to support first responders in the 17 political jurisdictions surrounding the national capital.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual merit of the proposed activity. The intellectual merit in this work lies both in the questions it raises through new modeling, and by the solutions it provides. Advancement of knowledge through the successful completion of this research will bring societal benefits in security, disaster recovery, and extension of SC networks to critical infrastructure, and it will pave the way for technology integrators to incorporate our innovations into deployable systems.

We find clusters and\/or Symmetric Multiprocessors (SMPs) being extensively used for commercial services such as e-commerce and transaction processing, everyday file\/web service needs, and for long running scientific applications in academic\/research settings. While hardware and software procurement costs for their deployment have dropped significantly, the total cost of ownership is in fact growing because of the costs of involving a human in managing and tuning these systems. It is a non-trivial task today to tune a system and service for each environment\/configuration. This proposal intends to develop a data-driven feedback framework - called Cruise Control - to aid in the design and deployment of such autonomic servers. There are several research questions to be investigated in the development of this framework: What system and workload events (data) should we monitor in the server that have a consequence on its performance? How do we represent and store this data in a meaningful manner (and compress them in the process) since it may be collected over several days and at very fine resolution? Based on this historical data and currently evolving conditions, how do we design a controller that can modulate the server execution to avoid performance bottlenecks in a cost-effective manner? What system mechanisms are needed within the underlying operating system and middleware layer to provide the data collection and server modulation functionalities? How do we structure and develop this complete infrastructure on commodity systems without degrading the performance of the server?<br\/>The Cruise Control framework will provide system mechanisms for collecting the data and will attempt to characterize them to compress their representation. and will develop within the operating system mechanisms for effecting such performance modulation will also be developed within the operating system.

The research is on a new MAC protocol, denoted by CSMA\/CA2. The proposed scheme automatically adapts each node transmission rate to the bandwidth usage and the number of active nodes in the network. The proposed research includes a graceful rate adjustment algorithm that achieves fair channel access and a low collision rate, control theoretical analysis of the algorithm's parameters setting, and, provision of QoS support to diverse multimedia traffic. In addition, the proposed protocol adheres to the IEEE 802.11 CSMA\/CA standard. The adherence to open standards broadens the scope of usage of the proposed algorithm, making it interoperable with other third party network interface cards that adhere to these open standards. The analysis and simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed CSMA\/CA2 scheme has the following advantages of achieving significant power and bandwidth savings with reduced medium access delay compared to IEEE 802.11 CSMA\/CA; it is easy to implement, i.e., CSMA\/CA2 has low computational complexity and does not require additional control packets or buffers; it provides fair channel sharing with fast convergence; it is compatible with the IEEE 802.11 standard, i.e., nodes with both CSMA\/CA and CSMA\/CA2 can coexist in the same network; and, it can provide quality of service (QoS) support to different traffic classes. The project will extend the analysis to study the quantitative relationship between system convergence speed and the CSMA\/CA2 parameters. In addition, it will define adjustments of the control parameters that allow the system to provide different QoS support to different senders. Thorough analysis, both theoretical and experimental, will be carried out to determine the trade-off between CSMA\/CA2 performance under various coexistence environments as well as system convergence speed and stability. The project will also develop a wireless testbed that will allow us to test the proposed algorithms in a real wireless environment.","title":"NR: Next Generation MAC Protocol for Multimedia Wireless Networks","awardID":"0319871","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["526867","443993"],"PO":["565090"]},"87140":{"abstract":"This research project addresses the disconnect between the way in which humans ask questions on the Web and the existing interfaces to the state-of-the-art search engines. Search engines require online searchers to formulate their requests in idiosyncratic query languages whose syntax is unnatural and hard to learn by typical users. Furthermore, existing search engines are notoriously bad at returning documents which do not contain any of the terms given by the user and yet which were retrieved as relevant to the user's information need. The proposed work focuses on two areas of research: (1) probabilistic question-to-query transformation (query modulation) for Web access and (2) models of content transfer over web links.

Part (2) facilitates retrieval of relevant Web documents by virtue of the links from other relevant documents to them. The expected outcomes and impact of this project are threefold: (1) a better understanding of the interaction between document retrieval and question-answering in a Web environment, (2) better models describing how document relevance is transferred over the Web hypergraph, and (3) better algorithms for natural language access to the Web which will make it easier for millions of web users to find information that they need in a timely, accurate, and intuitive way.

While these formalisms appear to be generally effective, they are considerably more complex than simple node-and-link hypertext. Moreover, event networks are often associated with text passages and are often intended for educational uses where repeated navigation through the network following different paths is to be expected. In these contexts, ease of user access is crucial in order for the formalisms to be effective for users. In this project, the PI will extend his work on threaded event scenarios to address interface issues and develop supporting navigational landmarks, by applying composite hypertexts to complex domains to further develop timeline toolkits that his earlier work have created or suggested. He will develop more interactive and adaptive presentations, which allow users to branch from established guided tours within the event networks, and which, as the users gain greater familiarity with the network, enable adjustment of the landmarks that are presented to provide context for the users. Authors and other users will also be able to add annotations, and even structured meta-comments, to the event networks, for which dialog management and rhetorical structures will be supported.

The research goes well beyond the state-of-the art anomaly detection for centrally administered networks. In particular tools and practical data sharing algorithms are being developed for detecting coordinated intrusions, distributed denial of service attacks, and quality-of-service degradations in decentralized networks such as the Internet. The project also includes activities with broader impact including: creation of a public network anomaly database, K-12 educational outreach, and university-industry collaborations.<br\/>The research approach is based on a modular and distributed monitoring paradigm that is organized into a three level hierarchy: local level measurement of data from servers, routers and switches; intermediate level data analysis and processing of end-to-end traffic measurements, summary statistics and alarms transmitted from the local level; and upper level decision-making and processing of information transmitted from the intermediate level. This modular structure is scalable to large networks of monitoring sites. However, this structure also imposes constraints on data analysis which requires development of new<br\/>> approaches.

The software developments in each of the research sites will be glued together using a scripting language (Python) and made easy to use through a graphical interface. Additionally, the software will be extensively documented and distributed via an open source policy, encouraging continued collaboration and development.","title":"ITR: Subnanometer Structure Based Fold Determination of Biological Complex","awardID":"0324645","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["333760"],"PO":["565136"]},"87262":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>0330059<br\/>Sergio Servetto<br\/>Cornell University<br\/><br\/>the most pressing need after a major urban disaster---earthquakes, fires, (accidental or induced) infrastructure collapse---is for information needed to deal with the situation.

Providing access to the data is a formidable challenge because the measured data are distributed across the entire sensornet and communication between sensornet nodes requires substantial expenditures of scarce energy. Data-centric abstractions are now seen as a fundamental aspect of sensornet systems that provide efficient access to sensor measurements. In prior work, we have suggested that sensornet applications would benefit from data-centric storage. Such systems enable efficient querying and search in large-scale sensornets. However, data-centric storage makes exacting demands on its routing infrastructure. In particular, data-centric storage is predicated on a robust and efficient routing primitive that allows storing data by name at a node in the sensornet.<br\/><br\/>This proposal seeks to investigate the design and development of geographic hash tables (GHTs), a routing primitive for data-centric storage. GHTs bring together two technologies, distributed hash tables (DHTs) and geographic ad-hoc routing, that were developed in two completely unrelated contexts, peer-to-peer systems and ad hoc wireless networks. Each technology has been extensively explored in its respective domain, but the combination of these technologies in the new, and more challenging, context of sensor networks raises many new design challenges.","title":"SENSORS: Robust and Efficient Data Dissemination for Data-Centric Storage","awardID":"0330178","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}}],"PIcoPI":["560562","553707"],"PO":["469867"]},"86184":{"abstract":"Much of human intelligence can be broadly characterized as the ability to identify patterns and the visual system is the most sophisticated pattern finding mechanism that we have.

Today, certification of the dependability of a computer-based system frequently relies at least as heavily on assessments of the process used to develop it or of the qualifications of those who produced it, as it does on the system's observable properties. While these assessments can be useful, few would dispute that direct observation of the artifact ought to provide a stronger kind of assurance than the credentials of its production methods or producers could hope to do. Yet the complexity of software systems, as well as their discrete nature, renders them extremely difficult to analyze unless great care has been taken with their structure and maintenance.

The ability to learn enables a search engine to automatically adapt its retrieval strategy to individual users, to specific user groups, and to particular WWW sites. A search engine should learn, for example, that a query for ``Michael Jordan'' issued from a user at cs.cornell.edu is much more likely to refer to the professor at UC Berkeley than for an average user. Similarly, a search engine should be able to adapt to collection properties, for example, that in a particular intranet not the TITLE field, but the H1 headlines contain the most important information.<br\/><br\/>Since explicit user feedback is rarely available, implicit feedback derived from observable user behavior is used as the input to the learning algorithms. Such implicit feedback requires new machine learning methods, since it comes in forms that are different from the standard machine learning settings.

The project analyzes the reliability of implicit clickthrough data, designs and analyzes learning methods, and evaluates their applicability on an educational database, providing a service to the scientific community.

A very effective and recent technique used to combat fading is to use multiple antennas at both input (transmitter end) and output (receiver end). The term space-time communication channel is used to describe the fading, wireless communication channel in the presence of multiple input and output antennas. Multiple input and output can be used to either increase the reliability of a wireless communication channel or else increase the rate at which information can be transmitted by a factor potentially equal to the number of transmit antennas. When used to both increase reliability and rate of information transfer, there is a tradeoff between the increase in information rate and the corresponding reliability of the communication link. This tradeoff is referred to as the rate-diversity tradeoff.

One of the most important communication primitives that has<br\/>to be provided by sensor networks is information gathering: information from<br\/>the sensors has to be forwarded to a single point for evaluation. Since sensors<br\/>will exist with the ratio of thousands of nodes per user, it is impossible to<br\/>pay attention to any individual node. Hence, it is important to use<br\/>communication methods in sensor networks that are extremely simple - to allow a<br\/>verification of their correct implementation - and self-reconfiguring - to<br\/>allow automatic adjustments to changes in the sensor network or sensing tasks.<br\/>Furthermore, since sensors are simple devices with limited processing power,<br\/>storage capacity, and energy, it is important to develop routing strategies<br\/>that can support information gathering as efficiently as possible. Whereas many<br\/>heuristics have already been suggested for resource-efficient information<br\/>gathering in sensor networks, almost no rigorous theoretical work has been<br\/>performed in this area yet. Therefore, the goal of this project is to explore<br\/>fundamental concepts for self-reconfigurable and resource-efficient information<br\/>gathering in wireless sensor networks.<br\/><br\/>This project concentrates on networks of static sensors (i.e. sensors do not<br\/>move around, which is commonly the case). However, the observer may move<br\/>around. Also, connections between sensors may be available or unavailable<br\/>depending on the underlying medium access control protocol or temporary<br\/>problems such as obstacles. In addition, sensors may fail permanently due to<br\/>energy problems. To ensure that the network protocols developed in the project<br\/>will work under any circumstances, models are used in which the injections of<br\/>packets, the status of the edges, and the movements of the observer are assumed<br\/>to be under adversarial control. The challenge is to find distributed online<br\/>protocols for this case - i.e. protocols performing online decisions that can<br\/>be executed locally at every sensor - that have a near-optimal throughput<br\/>using a near-minimum amount of energy and storage. Simple protocols with these<br\/>properties have recently been developed and analyzed by the PI for specific<br\/>cases (such as specific topologies of sensors and a static observer), and the<br\/>research goal of the project is to establish analytical and experimental<br\/>results for much more general cases.<br\/><br\/>A broad impact of the project is ensured by disseminating the research results<br\/>via lecture notes, conference and journal publications, presentations, and<br\/>publications on the Web.

Neither identifier reliably indicates how systems are \"positioned\" in the Internet<br\/>with respect to each other. Two IP addresses or Domain Names may be very similar, and yet the two<br\/>systems they represent may be far apart in terms of latency or throughput. This lack of a proximity<br\/>\"address\" is a serious limitation of the Internet architecture.<br\/><br\/>There have been several research projects to address this limitation. The pioneering work in this area<br\/>was IDMaps, which proposed an infrastructure service that could answer queries about proximity<br\/>between pairs of IP addresses. A subsequent advancement proposed using Global Network<br\/>Positioning (GNP)a proximity address formed from a Cartesian coordinate system super-imposed<br\/>on the Internet.<br\/><br\/>The primary shortcoming of these and other approaches is that they operate only at course<br\/>granularity. At less than 50ms latency (a typical east-to-west coast latency!), over-estimates of 200%<br\/>and 300% are common. This is entirely inadequate for applications such as networked first person<br\/>shooter games and tightly-coupled grid computing applications, both of which require latencies well<br\/>below 50ms. Data intensive grid computing applications and peer-to-peer applications like file<br\/>sharing would reduce network load significantly if participants in the same campus network or ISP<br\/>could find each other. Another shortcoming of existing approaches is that they typically require that<br\/>dedicated infrastructure be deployed. While this is feasible for private corporations like Akamai,<br\/>there exists no known business model for a common public proximity service.<br\/><br\/>This project will design and implement a system for calculating proximity addresses at very-fine<br\/>granularity (microsecond latencies and gigabit throughputs) and at global scale. By necessity this<br\/>system will be distributed (peer-to-peer), requiring that all nodes be able to serve as \"reference<br\/>points\" in the coordinate system. This is because it is impossible to represent microsecond latencies<br\/>unless the reference points are within microseconds. The existence of a global fine-grained<br\/>hierarchical proximity address, however, presents other tantalizing possibilities. For instance, such<br\/>an address could be used as the basis for building a new type of routing overlay, which could then be<br\/>used as a peer-to-peer discovery mechanism.<br\/><br\/>This project presents significant new intellectual challenges comparable to those in network routing<br\/>required to move from flat addressing to hierarchical addressing. The research team plans to design new forms of proximity addressing that are hierarchical rather than flat, that do not focus load on a few systems,<br\/>and that are simple enough that they can be auto-configured. The researchers also must design new types of P2P networks that are customized for the problem of configuring proximity addresses. These P2P<br\/>networks must be simpler than current networks so that they can truly scale to global proportion even<br\/>in the face of churn (nodes joining and leaving). This project is expected to produce broad<br\/>intellectual results in the structure of hierarchical proximity addresses and how they relate to network<br\/>metrics, as well as in how to build very large and simple peer-to-peer networks.<br\/><br\/>This project will have two forms of impact. First, any distributed application that dynamically<br\/>discovers participants, and requires that participants be nearby, will benefit from very-fine grained<br\/>proximity addresses. Such applications include networked games and Grid computing. Indeed the<br\/>improvements in granularity may enable the creation of new applications. Second, the advances in<br\/>peer-to-peer networking required for this project may serve as the basis for other types of peer-to-<br\/>peer applications. Specifically, any peer-to-peer application that requires the discovery of nodes that<br\/>can serve a certain role (i.e., act as reference points) will benefit from the advances in scale and<br\/>efficiency required for this project.","title":"SP: Very Fine-Grained Proximity Addressing","awardID":"0338750","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["316440"],"PO":["7594"]},"87352":{"abstract":"The proposed research is to investigate middleware technologies for ubiquitous computing, and under a partnership with HP Labs, extend those technologies to support interactive applications on the grid.

These two areas of computer vision have been explored with numerous approaches and very good results have been achieved, although for limited types of scenes, such as a single, smooth and textured surface. Occlusion is a cause of many remaining difficulties, since most algorithms cannot operate on areas visible in one image only. Furthermore, even though the human visual system has no difficulty estimating the depth or velocity of occluded objects, computer vision systems are incapable of that. They either produce arbitrary results for the occluded regions, or, at best, mark them as occluded. The second issue we need to address is the need for processing at multiple scales. Many real scenes contain objects that are perceived at different scales, both due to variations in size and level of detail and due to variations in texture density. A multiple scale processing scheme is necessary for processing such scenes. It must be capable of detecting and preserving fine details, not allowing larger or richer in texture regions to dominate smaller or less textures ones, achieving good continuation of structures, and filling in missing data.<br\/><br\/>To overcome these unavoidable difficulties, it is proposed to address stereo and motion analysis from a perceptual organization point of view using the tensor voting framework. It is claimed that tokens, generated by matching corresponding pixels in the two images, form coherent perceptual structures in the appropriate space, while erroneous matches generate outlier tokens. The tensor voting framework allows us to efficiently detect perceptual structures without employing parametric models, which makes it possible to handle arbitrary structures. Furthermore, the tensor voting framework is non-iterative, requires no initial estimate and has only one critical parameter, the scale of voting. It is proposed to explicit handle occlusion by incorporating monocular information from the images in conjunction with the results of binocular processing. Our proposed methodology not only detects occluded regions, but also computes estimates for the disparity or velocity of these regions, as shown in the preliminary results presented in the project description. Instead of compromising the quality of the results by selecting a single scale of analysis for the entire scene, which would be sub-optimal in most regions, our approach automatically infers the smallest scale that can preserve the finer details, then proceeds with larger scales to ensure good continuation in regions with sparse or missing data.<br\/><br\/>The preliminary results compare favorably to the best algorithms reported to date, including some standard data sets.

Rather than building MRD-seeded lexicons, hand-crafted lexicons (WordNet, EuroWordNet), and corpus-informed lexicons (FrameNet), this work will employ a methodology for building a \"corpus-driven\" lexicon, constrained by specific linguistic modeling principles. Such a \"selectional context dictionary\" overcomes many of the shortcomings of previous LKB approaches by capturing a richer level of selectional context for predicates in the language. This is possible with the use of shallow parsing of predicate arguments, and the assignment of types from a shallow semantic type system. The technique will be evaluated the selectional discriminatory capabilities of the results, according to established methods; namely, precision and recall measurements against an annotated test set of unseen text.","title":"SGER: Sense in Context: Construction of a Selectional Context Dictionary for English Clauses","awardID":"0340550","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2005-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7274","name":"HUMAN LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["562587"],"PO":["565227"]},"89179":{"abstract":"The construction and validation of highly dependable software<br\/>currently requires extraordinary effort, especially when using<br\/>multiple threads of control, due to the need to consider all possible<br\/>thread interleavings.

Solving the problem will have the most effect in query optimization, data warehousing, and information integration. The project focuses on the methodology of evaluating queries using views; views are relations that are defined by auxiliary queries and can be used to rewrite and answer user queries. One way to improve query performance is precompute and store (i.e., \"materialize\") views. To truly optimize query performance, it is critical to materialize the \"right\" views. The project will demonstrate that, by designing and materializing views, it is possible to ensure optimal or near-optimal performance of frequent and important queries, for common and important query types. The focus of this effort is on developing efficient and scalable heuristic algorithms that design (near-) optimal sets of views for the given queries. The project has two parts: (1) theoretical analysis and design of algorithms and heuristics for view design, and (2) implementation and experiments on large databases, to evaluate the performance improvements caused by using the views. <br\/>The techniques resulting from this project could have application in commercial and experimental database systems, where they will provide new ways to lower query-processing costs.

Upon collapsing due to natural or manmade causes, the radios are deployed to form an ad-hoc sensor network that determines the internal composition and structure of the collapsed pile. This information is relayed to external rescuers in the form of 3-D reconstruction of the interior structure (including key features such as air cavities) that can speed up rescue efforts and save lives. Adding additional sensing capability, such as heartbeat, voice, heat, and gas sensors will provide information about the location of other survivors and any fires or gas leaks. The role of such technology in mitigating the impact of natural disasters such as earthquakes (e.g. the 1999 earthquake in Turkey killed as many as 18,000 people, many due to the slow process of excavating rubble blindly) as well as manmade causes, will constitute the primary outcomes of this work.

It is important to detect outbreaks early in order to provide the best possible medical response and treatment, as well as to improve the chances of identifying the source. A primary goal of this project is to develop basic new Bayesian probabilistic inference algorithms that monitor electronically available healthcare data to achieve early, reliable detection of outbreaks. In particular, inference will take place on Bayesian networks that model the links between available data and possible causes of outbreaks. <br\/>The scientific challenge of monitoring for outbreaks within an entire population create major computational challenges in building and applying Bayesian models that are orders of magnitude larger than those developed previously. The project will apply and extend state-of-the-art probabilistic inference methods to achieve efficient inference. If inference indicates that an outbreak is likely, an alert will be raised automatically. Appropriately, however, public health officials are unlikely to blindly trust an outbreak alert, unless there is an explanatory justification. Automated explanation of Bayesian inference is therefore another key project goal. <br\/>The scientific contributions of this project will follow from developing, investigating, and evaluating new modeling and algorithmic techniques that make Bayesian biosurveillance practical for monitoring and diagnosing (in real time) the disease-outbreak status of an entire population. In investigating these issues, this project is anticipated to make both specific scientific contributions to computer science, statistics, and public health, as well as broader contributions to public safety.","title":"ITR: Bayesian Modeling for Biosurveillance","awardID":"0325581","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"V371","name":"NSA-ITR BAYESIAN MODELING"}}],"PIcoPI":["406755"],"PO":["563727"]},"86253":{"abstract":"The 2003\/2004 Florida Special Year Program in Mathematics, in applied mathematics, is in the area of multiscale analysis and applications.

Whitaker<br\/>University of Utah<br\/><br\/>Project Summary<br\/>The goal of this project is to develop a new set of computational tools for processing and analyzing surfaces that are extracted from complex biological data sets. The purpose is closing the gap that prevents the widespread use of geometric surface-filtering tools in biological and medical applications. This gap exists for two reasons. The first is that these sophisticated and powerful tools for filtering surfaces rely on numerical algorithms that are computationally demanding. The second reason is that biological applications require not only surface filtering, but a set of complimentary tools for higher-level processing. Thus, the proposed work will address both issues, better filtering algorithms and higher-level processing tools. The broader impact of this work is as follows. Agro wing number of scientific and medical investigations rely on studying populations of subjects through 3D imaging. Such studies produce databases of images and therefore require better tools for extracting meaningful information from the individual images and quantifying geometric properties in order to make scientific conclusions. Previous work focused on extracting the surfaces that are embedded in this 3D data, but many of the relevant biological questions pertain to the geometric properties of those surfaces. The investigators envision a powerful new toolbox that will enable scientists, engineers, and clinicians to process 3D surface data. More specifically, the PI for the proposed work is engaged in several different projects that have such requirements, and thus the proposed work has concrete implications for ongoing research with direct applications. Furthermore, the proposed work has an educational element that includes multidisciplinary educational opportunities for postdoctoral candidates and graduate students and a program by which we will expose undergraduate women to leading-edge research in hardware and software for 3D graphics. The proposed work builds upon previous results that generalize the fundamentals of image processing to surfaces. That work produced technologies for surface reconstruction from tomographic data and geometric versions of variational image filters such as Gaussian smoothing, anisotropic diffusion, and high-boost filtering. These developments have broad implications for a variety of problems that entail extracting, analyzing, and visualizing surfaces. To satisfy the goals of this project, the investigators will pursue two areas of research. The first is the development of better algorithms for variational surface filtering. The focus of this part of the work is on speed and accuracy. The investigators will examine more efficient and accurate numerical techniques and surface representations, as well as implementations on commodity graphics cards.<br\/>The second area of research is the development of new algorithms for analysis. This work will focus on surface segmentation, feature detection, shape quantification, and surface matching. All of this work will be implemented in conjunction with the Insight Toolkit, an open-source, NIH-sponsored software framework for multidimensional image processing.","title":"ITR\/CCR: Geometric Surface Processing Tools for Analysis of Biological Data","awardID":"0313268","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["515717"],"PO":["521045"]},"82030":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>0306457<br\/>New Mexico State University<br\/>Cook, Jonathan<br\/><br\/>In this age of information, computers have entered virtually every aspect of society and life, and<br\/>the future holds expectations of ubiquitous communicating computers, from the PDA-cellphones on<br\/>the belt, the desktops at work and home, the traveling laptop, and the smart car. In this alwaysnetworked<br\/>world, it is to be expected that these systems will automatically receive and utilize software upgrades, new software applications, and the like. Today's software has taken the tentative first steps towards automatic, component-based software evolution, but in these mechanisms there is no real control over the evolving software components. Rather, users are quite familiar with the problems of mis-matched, wrongly timed changes in system components. Overcoming these problems will be crucial to developing the \\always-on\" future of ubiquitous computing. This project will take advantage of the rise in dynamic, distributed, component-based software architectures, and will pursue active techniques to help maintain reliability during system execution and throughout system evolution.<br\/>Specifically, this research will investigate dynamically combining and controlling multiple versions<br\/>of components to increase the overall system reliability throughout its evolution. The goal is to provide a framework where component versions can be inspected, managed, and manipulated. Such a framework will allow new versions of components to be brought into a system to introduce enhancements, while still keeping older versions on-line to protect the system against accidental faults that break existing functionality. In addition, it will enable basic component management facilities that will allow self-checking of components and enable basic reasoning about the dynamic version dependencies that exist in the system.","title":"Active Support for the Evolution of Component-Based Software","awardID":"0306457","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["557313"],"PO":["564388"]},"82393":{"abstract":"The goal of this project is to investigate a framework to capture both the semantics and essence of an activity pertaining to moving sensor data streams. Moving sensors refers to an emerging class of data intensive applications that impacts disciplines such as communication, health-care, scientific applications, etc. These applications consist of a fixed number of sensors that move and produce streams of data as a function of time. With communication, for example, a hearing impaired individual might utilize a cyber glove that translates hand signs into written (spoken) words. The glove consists of a sensor for each finger joint that reports its location as a function of time, producing streams of data.<br\/><br\/>The framework consumes streams of data and constructs their multi level, spatio temporal representation at different levels of abstraction. This multi-layer design ensures extensibility, modularity, and physical data independence from the stream producing devices. While this framework is demonstrated in the context of several applications, its key demonstration is with an application to recognize hand signs (in particular, American Sign Language) using a virtual-reality glove. This shows the extensibility of the framework to recognize new signs and its modularity to handle new input devices. The framework improves the quality of detected patterns by (a) employing buffers for delayed decision making, (b) different layers maintain context to provide hints when input data is noisy, and (c) employs the concept of Envelope of Limits (EoL) to compensate for a user's slight variations when performing a spatio-temporal sign. <br\/><br\/>More information can be obtained from the project web sites (http:\/\/dblab.usc.edu) and (http:\/\/infolab.usc.edu).

The research will provide an environment through simulation that presents a user with avatars needed to construct and manage an information system. This solution, being prototyped at the United States Military Academy (USMA), addresses the lack of hands-on training by building an information assurance simulation that integrates all the complexities involved in maintaining an information system infrastructure and making it widely available to educational facilities. These complexities include hardware configuration, service requirements, \"sizing\" the system to the correct capacity, system administrative support, and security configuration. <br\/><br\/>This simulation-based pedagogical application allows users to construct networks, impose policies, and manage system administrators. After constructing a network, the user can run a series of scenarios against the network and watch as the network fails or succeeds based on network load or security attacks. This simulation allows the user to explore the interrelationships between people, procedures, hardware, software, and data and how each of these factors impacts on network design and security. <br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit of the project is centered on the strong research and educational focus of the project. The research crosses the boundaries of disciplines by offering a robust tool for teaching and understanding the fundamentals of construction, management, and security of computer networks. The concept of implementing a network simulation toolset will allow closed-lab experimentation with information assurance issues at a variety of institutions across the nation. The resulting system should provide a platform for enhancing education in many disciplines and settings.

This should allow educational institutions with modest facilities and limited expertise to have access to a scalable tool for information assurance education. The scalability and scenario management provided in the simulation allow a wide range of educational institutions to productively incorporate the tools into their curriculum. <br\/><br\/>The emphasis in this project is information assurance aspects of networks through a client-controlled environment for learning without extensive engineering prerequisites.

To meet these requirements simultaneously, a new breed of processors, referred to as network processors (NPUs), has emerged. Network processors, when combined with general-purpose processors, function-specific coprocessors and other reconfigurable logic elements, create a powerful platform for designing network systems. <br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, the methodologies and tools needed for programming these embedded, highly-parallel network systems are in their infancy. Today, to develop high-performance packet processing applications on such systems, programmers are required to be intimately familiar with the hardware. Programmers are required to partition their application at design time among the different processor types and develop hand-tuned code for managing network system resources. This approach is tedious, slow, and yields code that is difficult to port from one NPU-based platform to another. With the next-generation of network systems and NPUs supporting a larger number of processors, more diverse memory hierarchies, and more complex processor interconnects, the difficulty in programming network systems will only increase over time. <br\/><br\/>The objective of the proposed research is to create a programming environment that will make future generations of network systems as easily programmable as today's workstations and servers.

Together, this set of tools and methodologies will create an environment that will facilitate rapid development of portable, high-performance packet processing applications on programmable network systems-the building blocks of future generations of multi-service information networks.","title":"ITR: Designing a Programming Environment for Network Systems","awardID":"0326001","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["515656","518067","519591","261975","466839"],"PO":["565090"]},"86320":{"abstract":"Abstract:<br\/>Interconnection network fabrics are becoming an ever-more critical <br\/>communication backbone of many digital systems, providing the means for <br\/>systems to scale up in capacity.

Distributed sensor networks have been recently proposed for managing such environments. For example, in a disaster recovery situation, the response team can first deploy a large number of small sensors in the area and then a number of mobile agents can move into the field of the sensors collecting and aggregating information. The sensors and the mobile agents will have to then rapidly organize themselves to form a wireless network. Distributed algorithms are needed to coordinate the movements of the agents so that the exploration of the area can be done as quickly and as efficiently as possible. This has to be achieved in the presence of possible failures and given the constraints of the sensors and the established network. Finally, the overall system should enable the response team to collect and analyze the data in a fast and dependable way.<br\/><br\/>There are various key requirements that we need to address in developing such a dynamic sensor network. For example, (1) sensor nodes must be positioned strategically to capture events of interest, (2) high priority events must be delivered within a deadline end-to-end even in the presence of node failures, (3) streams of data originating from different sensors must be coordinated and examined dynamically, and (4) feedback information must be generated and propagated in real-time in response to the urgency of the situations. Given the dynamic nature of the environment, the proposed system must learn and adapt dynamically to changes in the mission or to network conditions.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of this project is to develop a robust, adaptive and scalable infrastructure for a self-organizing and highly dynamic sensor network. The network communication and the operating system should be managed in an integrated manner so as to provide a robust and adaptive infrastructure for the development of computing applications. The inferences made by the higher layer applications and data analysis functions will determine future trajectories of the mobile agents, and may invoke the tuning of certain parameters that determine the extent to which data is being collected and fused. These events would require the network to re-organize itself. On the other hand, the network itself may impose constraints on where the mobile agents can move, where data may be fused, and how different entities co-ordinate in order to make operations efficient.<br\/><br\/>The distinguishing characteristic of our proposal is that we take a holistic approach that addresses multiple levels of the sensor network (namely the network communication, the operating system and the analysis of the data) in an integrated way. Our solutions will need to work well in this closely coupled system, while dynamically adapting to changes in the networking infrastructure or the system conditions. We propose to develop the architecture, protocols and mechanisms to realize such a system. This project requires strong collaboration and expertise between networking, distributed systems and data mining\/database researchers; the PI team covers all these areas.<br\/><br\/>More specifically, our work will focus on the following tasks:<br\/><br\/>Layer 1: Tunable Networking Protocols.<br\/>We propose to develop protocols for anycasting and synchronization of fusion operations, and algorithms to calculate the trajectory control of the mobile agents.<br\/><br\/>Layer 2: Distributed Management Protocols.<br\/>We propose to develop replication and allocation mechanisms for the application services. <br\/><br\/>Layer 3: Data Analysis Techniques.<br\/>We propose to develop techniques for data fusion and query execution on online asynchronous streams.

The practical issues have to do with the development of concrete methods that approach or attain the fundamental limits. The typical field to be measured and transported is highly correlated at neighboring locations. This project explores two approaches to exploiting this correlation to substantially increase efficiency. In one approach, the data compression and network routing are jointly designed to complement one another. In the second approach, Slepian-Wolf distributed coding is used. This permits the data compression and data dissemination functions to be independently designed and operated.

Learning such models would facilitate a unified framework for simultaneously solving of certain human motion analysis problem including: 1) providing spatiotemporal priors for tracking. Since the effect of personal style is explicitly decomposed, these priors can be specialized to the particular tracked subject. 2) parameterizing the personalized style effect in a way that will be useful for identifying the subject performing the action. 3) Detecting spatiotemporal action outliers. Inline with this ultimate goal, this proposal addresses the effect of style variations on appearance changes in terms of shape, i.e., human silhouettes. Human silhouette (shape) deformation is considered as a global form of appearance changes that carries sufficient information that can be exploited for further analysis of human motion. The observed human silhouette at each time instant is considered as a shape derived from a generic spatiotemporal model that can be specialized to the particular human being tracked through explicit decomposition of orthogonal style variation modes. Since the silhouettes undergo topological changes over time, correspondences between landmarks (features) are not always feasible. Therefore, the research will focus on global shape representations that do not require establishing feature correspondences. The research will focus on the use of explicit and kernel-based implicit nonlinear mapping approaches where the mapped silhouettes can be decomposed using multi-linear tensor decomposition into orthogonal factors given bases for each factor affecting the shape deformation such as body pose, spatial style, and temporal style.","title":"Nonlinear Spatiotemporal Models for Decomposing Style Variations using Kernel Methods","awardID":"0328991","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7339","name":"COMPUTER VISION"}}],"PIcoPI":["518508"],"PO":["317663"]},"89202":{"abstract":"NSF 0341304<br\/>Assured Software Composition for Real-Time Systems<br\/>Vitek<br\/><br\/>This projects investigates fundamental issues involved in the<br\/>construction of scalable, reconfigurable, real-time embedded systems.<br\/>The work focuses on application of object-oriented technologies and,<br\/>in particular, the Real-time Specification for Java (RTSJ) to the<br\/>domain of mission critical embedded software systems.

Using hedonic models, it is possible to interpret wage data for heterogeneous labor, evaluate workplace safety laws and analyze subsidies for wages and job training in terms of their impacts on equilibrium wages and prices and on market participant welfare. Hedonic models lie at the heart of modern methods to adjust cost of living indices for changes in quality. <br\/><br\/>This research will develop the economic foundations of hedonic models in more general settings than have been developed to date. Specifically, the research will characterize the properties of alternative hedonic economies, including the existence and uniqueness of hedonic pricing models in multi-attribute models under different assumptions about dimensions of heterogeneity that characterize agents, competitive structure of markets, the grouping of agents into coalitions, characteristics priced in the market, and the nature of the heterogeneity of agents. Computation of hedonic equilibria is of interest in its own right, and for determining the consequences of alternative assumptions on pricing, as well as for exploring the impacts of different policies on producer and consumer welfare. It is also an essential ingredient in the econometric analyses we propose to conduct. Our analysis of existence and uniqueness is a vital step in developing computationally robust methods for simulating hedonic economies and for recovering preferences and technologies from hedonic economies.<br\/><br\/>This research will also conduct and econometric analyses of hedonic economies under alternative assumptions about market structure, technology and preferences, and the information available to agents and to econometricians. We will conduct identification analysis and develop nonparametric and semiparametric methods to recover the primitives of preferences, technology, the distributions of productivities and preferences. We will apply these econometric methods to analyze the determinants of earnings, housing prices and public goods using data on individuals, firms, and communities. We also propose to examine identification problems in models of social interactions using information on prices to solve identification problems.","title":"Collaborative Research on the Formulation, Estimation, and Identification of Hedonic Pricing, Demand and Supply Models","awardID":"0241858","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0405","name":"Division of OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE","abbr":"SES"},"pgm":{"id":"1320","name":"ECONOMICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0405","name":"Division of OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE","abbr":"SES"},"pgm":{"id":"1333","name":"METHOD, MEASURE & STATS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0703","name":"Division of CIVIL, MECHANICAL, & MANUFACT","abbr":"CMMI"},"pgm":{"id":"1266","name":"APPLIED MATHEMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["520206","260107","473709","260105"],"PO":["352775"]},"78466":{"abstract":"The focus of this project is to develop models and technologies for prevention of security threats via illegal inferences in semantically enhanced semistructured information. XML and RDF data has been increasingly used for storing and exchanging information, thus enabling Internet users to access and integrate large amounts of data intelligently. This large-scale data integration, especially when supported with ontologies, may pose significant security and privacy threats. Therefore, security methods and tools need to be developed to prevent security violations. To provide information assurance in the context of Semantic Web several issues - technological, managerial, and legal - need to be addressed. This project focuses mainly on technological issues to provide information confidentiality and privacy, and makes several novel contributions: (1) Web data that can express context-based and semantic requirements; (2) comprehensive study of the security implications for illegal inference capabilities on semistructured data; and (3) both defensive and offensive security models are considered in Semantic Web security. More information about the project is available on the project web site (http:\/\/www.cse.sc.edu\/research\/isl). In addition to theoretical research, the developed models and technologies will be implemented and tested on real data. The prototypes will be evaluated based on scalability, efficiency, and level of assurance. Broader impact of this project lies in providing data security on the Web and a wide range of Web applications, with a guarantee of information confidentiality. Research and educational activities are tied together to increase the security awareness of students and community. In addition, seminars and Web sites to increase cyber-security awareness of middle and high school students will be developed, aiming to reduce the number of cyber crimes exploiting juvenile users.","title":"CAREER: Semantic Web-Interoperation versus Security","awardID":"0237782","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["212889"],"PO":["427499"]},"87057":{"abstract":"This research investigates the feasibility and utility of monitoring student emotions in spoken dialogue tutorial systems. While human tutors respond to both the content of student utterances and underlying perceived emotions, most tutorial dialogue systems cannot detect student emotions, and furthermore are text-based, which may limit their success at emotion prediction. While there has been increasing interest in identifying problematic emotions (e.g. frustration, anger) in spoken dialogue applications such as call centers, little work has addressed the tutorial domain.<br\/><br\/>The PIs are investigating the use of lexical, syntactic, dialogue, prosodic and acoustic cues to enable a computer tutor to automatically predict and respond to student emotions. The research is being performed in the context of ITSPOKE, a speech-based tutoring dialogue system for conceptual physics. The PIs are recording students interacting with ITSPOKE, manually annotating student emotions in these as well as in human-human dialogues, identifying linguistic and paralinguistic cues to the annotations, and using machine learning to predict emotions from potential cues. The PIs are then deriving strategies for adapting the system's tutoring based upon emotion identification.<br\/><br\/>The major scientific contribution will be an understanding of whether cues available to spoken dialogue systems can be used to predict emotion, and ultimately to improve tutoring performance. The results will be of value to other applications that can benefit from monitoring emotional speech.

Medical centers almost everywhere today are facing an interesting challenge in analyzing the huge volumes of image and associated clinical data collected daily as part of several ongoing studies. By focusing on the regions of interest (ROIs), the approach uses novel techniques to extract their most discriminative features and uses them in classification and similarity searches. New representations of the information content of medical images are also provided. Statistical and data compression techniques are employed to facilitate the retrieval of similar ROIs. Information theoretic tools are used to relate complexity of function to that of structure. Moreover, spatial data mining tools are developed to efficiently discover associations between image data and non-image (functional) data. The approaches have applicability to medical images from a wide range of modalities (e.g., mammography, angiography, CT, MRI, fMRI, confocal microscopy, etc) showing normal and abnormal conditions of various structures. Information about the function of structures related to various medical conditions is extracted from clinical assessment. Finding similarities and differences between image data of a given new subject and previously seen subjects will assist the correlation of this information with clinical assessment of function, pathology, or response to drugs. It is expected that this work will be widely used within the medical imaging community to facilitate advances in both diagnosis, and treatment, and to provide new insight into the relation of anatomy and function. The project will provide an excellent resource for graduate work in data mining, data compression, multimedia databases, and other areas. The goal of the educational plan is to provide students with a solid theoretical background and practical experience on data mining and its applications in medicine, promote interdisciplinary learning, and enable the training of a more versatile type of scientist.

The need for QoS routing solutions has been recognized in several recent studies and has led to several ongoing efforts to introduce QoS extensions in IP routing protocols. Until now, the work on QoS routing has been carried out under the assumption that the underlying network architecture is reservation based. In such an architecture, routers must maintain per-flow state information and end systems must use explicit signaling messages to convey their QoS requirements. This explicit-reservation model, though attractive from a network control viewpoint, suffers from scalability problems. The proposed SQUARN model is intended to provide stateless QoS routing solutions that can be integrated into reservation-less QoS frameworks (e.g., DiffServ). SQUARN relies on dynamic packet forwarding mechanisms that make novel use of the TOS and TTL fields in the header of an IP packet. It also uses a probing procedure for exploration of viable QoS paths. Link metrics are disseminated in a scalable fashion using a subset of routers that form a \"dominating\" graph. \"Repair\" algorithms are used to dynamically update this dominating graph. Protocols and algorithms in support of the SQUARN framework will be developed in the course of this project, with emphasis on computational efficiency and backward compatibility with existing Internet routing protocols. The research agenda also includes an experimental component for evaluating the efficacy of the proposed solutions on a testbed of IP routers.<br\/><br\/>Besides its intellectual merits, the proposed project is expected to have a profound broader impact. The enabling of stateless QoS routing solutions will lead to successful commercialization of real-time voice (and video) applications, resulting in a significant reduction in long-distance phone rates and wide deployment of real-time multimedia applications (e.g., video telephony over IP). The source code of solutions developed in the course of this project will be publicly released. Various aspects of the proposed project will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses at the University of Arizona.

In addition to their traditional surveillance and monitoring applications, these networks have recently found many new applications for enhancing national security, reducing the impact of security breaches on the nation's critical infrastructure, and improving the government's ability to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from both man-made and catastrophic events. This project will examine a wireless video sensor network that is designed for surveillance over an extended period of time. Consequently, this project will explore several definitions for network lifetime, taking into account the percentage of nodes required to remain alive (corresponding to network coverage) and the different priorities of nodes based on their locations. <br\/><br\/>The PIs will consider several important factors that affect network lifetime, including base-station placement and network connectivity topology. An analysis of power dissipation behavior at video sensor nodes suggests that communication consumes significantly more energy than any other node activity. This power consumption can be controlled effectively by monitoring and adjusting the power level of the transmitter and the network traffic routing topology. By adjusting the topology of the network through intelligent base station placement and network connectivity among the video sensor nodes, we can optimize the transmitter power of video sensor nodes, thus extending network lifetime. We have found that techniques and algorithms developed in the field of computational geometry can help us obtain a good understanding of the nature of the problem and identify where difficulties lie. More important, such approaches enable us to develop very useful performance bounds to characterize properties of wireless video sensor networks, which is the basis to further development of customized solutions. In this research, we plan to further explore algorithms and techniques from computational geometry to study the impact of topology control (base-station placement, temporal topology, traffic routing) on network performance and characterize basic properties for wireless video sensor networks.

Such distributed systems may include networks of mobile CEs, CEs that are connected through the Internet, or CEs that are distributed over different states or countries (representing various data bases, for example). Due to the physical distance between nodes in large-scale distributed systems, communication and load-transfer activity among the nodes is infested with tangible, random delays. This behavior is unlike what is ordinarily assumed in localized distributed systems, for which the constituent CEs are within proximity of each other, benefiting from a dedicated fast communication medium. Both intuition and our Monte-Carlo simulation definitively indicate that the presence of such communication and load-transfer delays in distributed systems can lead to the failure of traditional load balancing algorithms. Thus, a delay-inclusive analytical framework is needed for the dynamics of task computing, and it is within such a framework that the development and optimization of delay-inclusive load-balancing policies can be realized.<br\/><br\/>The objectives of this program are to develop a general analytical framework for modeling the stochastic dynamics of delay-infested distributed systems and utilize it to develop load-balancing strategies that mitigate the performance degradation or failure caused by communication and load-transfer delays. The modeling is developed within a novel, regeneration-based queuing framework, and the load-balancing optimization will be carried out by means of statistical learning and stochastic prediction. The load-balancing strategies developed in this program will be tested in a physical distributed-system environment with realistic delays. To do so, a distributed-computing test-bed will be developed and deployed connecting existing data searching computers at UTK with a miniature clone system to be developed at UNM.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: The work proposed here is motivated by (but not limited to) practical, pressing issues arising in the current work done by the Co-PIs (at UTK) on The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National DNA Index System (NDIS) and its Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) software. The projected growth of this NDIS database and in the demand for searches of its contents necessitates migration to a parallel computing platform, and potentially to large-scale distributed systems, where the database is distributed or duplicated over geographically distant centers which are connected by means of a bandwidth-limited shared communication medium. The outcomes of this program will not only benefit the above systems but also a broad range of public, private and government database systems that perform searches over distributed sites.<br\/>The proposed research will also be utilized to improve the operation of large-scale virtual laboratories. The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at UNM has created an efficient way for the remote control of instruments and simulations over the Internet. This approach is applicable to both industry and distance education, and it is currently operational and accessible for designated users. However, this platform has not been tested with a large number of users in a real, distributed environment. The methodology in this research will be applied to enhance the performance of the existing educational platform and scale up its reach to a large network of institutions worldwide. This activity will also provide tremendous training opportunities in state-of-the-art information technology for graduate and undergraduate students.","title":"ITR Collaborative Research: Modeling and Mitigation of Communication-Delay Effects on Load Balancing in Large-Scale Distributed Systems","awardID":"0312182","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":[217636,217637],"PO":["7594"]},"86640":{"abstract":"Many of the innovative recent wireless devices rely on the unlicensed spectrum, spurred by its openness to new uses and users. At the same time, vast amounts of spectrum are still exclusively licensed to services with sparse demand and to standards that use antiquated technologies.

However, in recent years deregulation has introduced many more participants on the grid. Together with a push for some measure of decentralized control, this and a proliferation of intelligent digital devices on the grid have made the management of the grid increasingly dependent on internet technology and networked computers, exposing the grid to a new threat: cyber-attacks. At the same time, deregulation has resulted in economic pressures to operate the grid with less safety margin, increasing the potential damage caused by disturbances and the need for better control, and more rigorous analysis behind that control, more crucial. The grid's already overtaxed information technology (IT) infrastructure does not have the ability to deliver information with the required quality of service and flexibility to meet the ever-changing security requirements of the evolving grid. The IT infrastructure needs to be made highly adaptive to ensure its survivability. <br\/>Power researchers and engineers have detailed models of power dynamics on various geographic scales. However, none also incorporates other facets such as market factors, regulatory changes, and cyber-attacks that can affect the grid in different ways, and on different time scales. Because cyber-attacks target IT systems at their core, cyber-protection has to be an integral part of design. <br\/>One fundamental contribution of this project comes from incorporating cybersecurity features in the modeling and decision making tools for relating the complex interactions among the physical, information, economic, and regulatory signals within the evolving electric power grid. The research is organized around three thrusts of activity which are being pursued interactively: I. Hybrid models of grid information technology, power dynamics, cyber-attacks, policy and markets. II. Distributed agent systems for flexible and adaptive control of the grid and its survivability. III. Robust and secure status dissemination middleware for new grid information technology architectures<br\/>The electric power delivery system, the most critical of our critical infrastructures, is undergoing revolutionary changes. Successful completion of this research will contribute methodology, artifacts and knowledge to improve the security and efficiency of the power grid as it takes its new shape in coming years. This project sets the foundations of an ambitious collaborative research program between CMU and WSU, to address the complex issues associated with the modernization of the grid and its increasing reliance on an intelligent (i.e computerized) infrastructure.This collaborative research is structured as a long term interdisciplinary effort in which PhD students will acquire the kind of expertise this new phase of electricity generation and distribution calls for. In the short term, research tools are developed which can be used to compare different architectures for command and control of the grid and their survivability.","title":"Collaborative Research: ITR: Secure and Robust IT Architectures to Improve Survivability of the Power Grid","awardID":"0326006","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0406","name":"Office of INTL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING","abbr":"OISE"},"pgm":{"id":"7299","name":"Catalyzing New Intl Collab"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0801","name":"Division of ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY","abbr":"DEB"},"pgm":{"id":"7298","name":"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["440928","452195","468289"],"PO":["561889"]},"86563":{"abstract":"This project explores how the Internet influences cultures and societies by examining how information technology affects life in Central Asia.

These models are difficult to develop both because of algorithmic challenges specific to integration of multiple knowledge sources and the lack of robust language processing tools. The goal of this project is to develop models via new techniques for exploiting the information available in parallel multilingual corpora, i.e., translations of the same source in multiple languages. Such corpora implicitly encode a hidden, common core that can be uncovered using state-of-the-art estimation techniques. The project involves: i) automatic learning of structure within and across languages at multiple levels of abstraction: semantics, morphology, phonology, and paraphrasing, and ii) integration of the results into novel language model frameworks to address the problem of limited domain- and language-specific training data. The hypothesis is that, by sharing data and structure across languages and genres within a language, the resulting models will be richer and more robust. Such ideas were impossible to envision until recently; availability of multilingual corpora and increases in computing power make them now feasible.<br\/><br\/>This project marries machine translation and speech recognition language modeling techniques, anticipating that the combination will lead to more powerful and general models.

To characterize baseline vs. anomalous behavior of the Internet requires deployment of collaborative data collection, anomaly detection and pattern recognition for complex largescale systems. The project combines the forces of leading researchers in three complementary disciplines: (i) networking and data collection; (ii) statistical data analysis and signal processing; (iii) decentralized decision-making. The research goes well beyond the state-of-the art anomaly detection for centrally administered networks. In particular tools and practical data sharing algorithms are being developed for detecting coordinated intrusions, distributed denial of service attacks, and quality-of-service degradations in decentralized networks such as the Internet. The project also includes activities with broader impact including: creation of a public network anomaly database, K-12 educational outreach, and university-industry collaborations.<br\/>The research approach is based on a modular and distributed monitoring paradigm that is organized into a three level hierarchy: local level measurement of data from servers, routers and switches; intermediate level data analysis and processing of end-to-end traffic measurements, summary statistics and alarms transmitted from the local level; and upper level decision-making and processing of information transmitted from the intermediate level. This modular structure is scalable to large networks of monitoring sites. However, this structure also imposes constraints on data analysis, which requires development of new approaches. Three approaches are being pursued: distributed spatio-temporal data analysis using wavelets over graphs; event detection and classification using distributed pattern analysis and learning; and multi-site event correlation using discrete event dynamical systems and decentralized stochastic systems.","title":"Collaborative ITR\/CSE: Modular Strategies for Internetwork Monitoring","awardID":"0325653","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"I184","name":"National Security Agency"}}],"PIcoPI":["402290"],"PO":["564898"]},"87113":{"abstract":"Current spoken language understanding systems operate in a layered fashion, where utterances are processed entirely at one level (e.g., speech recognition) before hypotheses are passed to the next level (e.g., parsing).

High-<br\/>bandwidth signal processing applications, such as distributed audio or video processing, are becoming <br\/>increasingly common, and performing large amounts of processing in the distributed <br\/>system that implements the sensor network poses new design challenges. On the <br\/>one hand, high-performance sensor networks are like distributed embedded systems, which need <br\/>to be optimized to the application in order to minimize power consumption and cost and <br\/>maximize performance; on the other hand, they are like ad-hoc networks that need to be <br\/>able to be operate in a number of different configurations without radically increasing the <br\/>cost of operating the network. New design methodologies and tools are needed that can <br\/>create a resilient architecture that still takes advantage of application-specific <br\/>characteristics. Traditional algorithms and methodologies for designing distributed <br\/>embedded systems can handle some of the aspects of sensor networks, namely distributed <br\/>computation and the effects of communication delay, but their purpose is to select a <br\/>single good design. They provide no guarantees that any changes in the system <br\/>parameters (number of nodes, communication, power budget) will result in a system <br\/>that operates anywhere close to optimality.<br\/><br\/>With the proper choice of nodes and links, and the right topology and <br\/>communication patterns within the high-performance sensor network, the cost\/power\/performance <br\/>of the network can be substantially improved. A <br\/>combination of design-time and run-time decisions is required for the successful design <br\/>and deployment of high-performance sensor networks because certain characteristics <br\/>of the system will not be known until run time, <br\/>and those characteristics may change during operation of the network. Furthermore, the <br\/>configuration of the network may not be known at design time. The overall <br\/>hardware and software architecture of the network must be designed to operate well not <br\/>just at a single design point, but across a range of possible configurations and operating <br\/>decisions. This research seeks to balance the needs for optimizing the design and adapting its <br\/>operation at run time by developing new design methods that find pareto-optimal regions <br\/>in the design space.

In addition, the complexity of simultaneous expression of linguistic information on the hands, the face, and the upper body creates special challenges for both linguistic analysis and computer-based recognition. A major goal of this project is the development of pattern analysis algorithms for discovery of the co-occurrence, overlap, relative timing, frequency, and magnitude of linguistically significant movements of the hands, face, and upper body. These will be tested against the PI's recently developed corpus collected from native signers of American Sign Language (ASL).<br\/><br\/>The high-quality video data consist of multiple synchronized movie ?les, showing the signing from multiple angles (including a close-up of the face). Annotations were produced using SignStream (an application developed by the PIs), which enables transcription of parallel streams of information (e.g., movements of the hands, eyes, eyebrows, etc., that convey critical grammatical information in signed languages). The video data and annotations provide a basis for analyzing gestures occurring in the multiple manual and non-manual channels. The goal is to recognize temporal associations both within and across channels. Time-series analysis algorithms will be developed for comparing the degree of similarity of gestural components.<br\/><br\/>Clustering and indexing algorithms will be developed for identification of groups of similar gestural components from mixed discrete annotation event labels (e.g., gloss, eyebrow raise, hand-shape, etc.) and sampled measurement data (e.g., head orientation, direction of eye gaze, hand motion). Since several gestural channels include periodic motions of varying frequency and magnitude (e.g., head nods and shakes), periodicity analysis modules will also be developed. Linguists and computer scientists will collaborate to determine how best to exploit and combine the information available from these different sources. Moreover, the information emerging from the computer science research will be of enormous benefit for the ongoing linguistic research being conducted by the PI's research team on the syntax of ASL. Syntactic research on signed languages has been hindered by the daunting task of attempting to uncover these patterns solely through observation, without the aid of tools for analyzing large amounts of data.<br\/><br\/>To support time-series pattern analysis in SignStream, computer vision algorithms will be developed for analysis of video to extract measurements the head, face, eyes\/eyebrows, arms, and upper body, as well as hands. These algorithms will model and exploit joint statistics; i.e., they will explicitly model correlations and associations across gestural channels. The vision algorithms will also make use of information available from the existing annotations to acquire models via supervised learning. These algorithms will allow a feedback loop where the dynamical models estimated during data analysis\/clustering can be used to \"tune\" the tracking modules to specific gestures.<br\/><br\/>It is expected that this approach should prove useful in analyzing gestural patterns in other HCI applications. As part of the effort, the SignStream system will be employed in user studies of vision-based interfaces for the severely handicapped, in collaboration with colleagues at Boston College. Video will be captured via multiple cameras, and partially annotated by the HCI researcher and the clinicians, supplemented with performance data (speed, accuracy, fatigue) and output of the vision analysis algorithms.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Algorithms and software developed in this effort will be made available to the research community via FTP, as extensions to SignStream. Thus, these tools will be available to the established, diverse group of researchers who already use SignStream in linguistics and computer human interface research. The gestural pattern analysis tools developed in this project should accelerate linguistic research on the critical role of non-manual channels in signed languages and gestural communication. Moreover, better understanding of the combined role that non-manual and manual channels play should lead to improved accuracy in computer-based sign language recognition systems, as well as speech recognition systems that model gestural components observed in video. Conversely, systems for synthesis of signed languages and gestural communication would be able to model and generate these non-manual movements over the appropriate linguistic domains, in order to achieve better realism. Finally, it is hoped that pattern analysis algorithms will be useful in the study of gestural interfaces more generally.

The PIs are then deriving strategies for adapting the system's tutoring based upon emotion identification.<br\/><br\/>The major scientific contribution will be an understanding of whether cues available to spoken dialogue systems can be used to predict emotion, and ultimately to improve tutoring performance.

A majority of the existing remote visualization systems have adopted the client-server model. The server may become a bottleneck due to the centralized data access and visualization computation. In addition, the network can be easily overloaded because of the large volume of visualization data to be transmitted. To overcome these problems, researchers have proposed various methods to decentralize the remote visualization computation by shifting workload to the clients. The effect of such a workload migration however, is limited since the client 92s computation power is often constrained. Another alternative to reduce the server bottleneck is to deploy multiple servers in the network. However, deployment and management of multiple servers is very expensive, and may raise some policy issues.<br\/><br\/>Our objective is to develop a scalable, lightweight, and easily deployable architecture, which is capable of providing a certain degree of quality of services (QoS) to remote visualization of time-varying data. To achieve this objective, we propose a Peer-to-peer (P2P) system-based architecture. Generally speaking, each node in a P2P system is considered equal, and hence this model is technically different from the client-server one. The highlights of our architecture are (1) Server data and workload are distributed to the groups of volunteer nodes in the Internet which are willing to share their resources. These nodes compose multiple virtual servers. (2) The client is allowed access to the server group via anycast service. Anycast automatically finds the best server in the group, and returns the data to the requesting client. The best server is supposed to provide the best quality of services (i.e. in terms of the minimum delay in data access). (3) A spatio temporal multi-resolution data structure, called Time-Space Partitioning (TSP) tree, where multiple resolution blocks are stored and the data on the sub-trees are independent of each other, is employed. By storing multiple resolution blocks in the tree, a client is permitted more choices in making the selection of best server, which may vary with the system dynamics.<br\/><br\/>In this project, we plan to fully design, analyze, implement, and evaluate the P2P-based<br\/>architecture for remote visualization of time-varying data.

The experimental program is divided between two testbeds. The first testbed (implemented at Drexel) focuses on the electromagnetic propagation characteristics of the MIMO channel, while the second testbed (implemented at UT-Austin) makes use or the electromagnetic characterization to examine the channel impact of the higher network layers. Systems with MIMO communication links, fueled by the increasing demand for high-speed and high-quality mobile communication, use multiple antenna arrays, one at the transmitter and one at the receiver, to take advantage of the spatial dimension of the propagation channel. When properly designed, multi-array communication links can provide multi-fold increases in link throughput in addition to reductions in channel variation which in turn may be used to provide higher rates to single users, lower delay links, or to allow multiple users to coexist in the spatial channel. Because of this advantages, MIMO capability is being considered for indoor local area networks (LAN)s, cellular multimedia data networks, and broadband wireless access. However, without careful design, the results of electromagnetic interaction, such as mutual coupling, may correlate the channel coefficients, thus resulting in a loss in terms of capacity or error probability. Real experimental propagation and experimental data are needed to correlate the tradeoffs between different antenna designs, antenna placements, scattering models, channel bandwidth, and transceiver algorithms. This research involves designing and building two experimental platforms for wideband MIMO propagation channel measurement and real-time prototyping.

Given recent advances in computer hardware and numerical methods, it is now possible to simulate physical phenomena at very fine temporal and spatial resolutions. As a result, the the amount of data generated is overwhelming. <br\/><br\/>Scientists are interested in analyzing and visualizing the data produced by such simulations to better understand the process that is being simulated. Analyzing such large scale data is hard. Not only the methods used are computationally expense, current programming tools make the analysis difficult to specify and modify. Thus, there is a dire need for a systematic approach, along with supporting algorithms and methodologies for flexible parallel implementations, to achieve scalable and interactive analysis on large scientific datasets. <br\/><br\/>In this project, we propose the construction of such a scalable toolkit, namely the Computational Analysis Toolkit (CAT). This toolkit proposes to exploit ongoing work in feature analysis, scalable data mining and parallel programing environments. The crux of the approach is feature-mining; a process where by regions are delineated through various stages of detection, verification, <br\/>de-noising, and tracking of points of interest. Additionally, we propose the use of some key data mining mining algorithms for achieving enhanced and robust implementations of feature-mining algorithms. <br\/><br\/>It is our objective that the CAT toolkit should not only allow for the detection of features but also provide for a means to control the analysis in an interactive setting. For example, demographic and lifetime analysis of certain critical features as determined by the user\/scientist may be an important way of understanding the underlying process being simulated. These critical features, once tagged via a suitable interface, can be profiled and a concise representation this profile can then be presented to the user as needed. <br\/><br\/>We believe that for long-term use of a tool for feature and data mining, it is important that a) the algorithms are parallelized on a variety of platforms, b) the parallel implementations are easy to maintain and modify, and c) APIs are available for users to rapidly create scalable implementations of new mining algorithms. We are proposing to achieve these goals by using and extending a parallelization framework developed locally. This framework, referred to as FRamework for Rapid Implementations of Datamining Engines (FREERIDE), offers high-level APIs and runtime techniques to enable parallelization of algorithms for data mining and related tasks. It allows parallelization on both distributed memory and shared memory configurations, and further supports efficient processing of disk-resident datasets.<br\/><br\/>The proposal, besides providing a useful toolkit, is likely engender the use of methodologies for large data exploration.

Designing the software for any complex system unavoidably involves the design and regulation of the human conduct that the system engages. Typically, however, the software code that formalizes such codes of conduct is not highlighted or treated specially in the design process. Such rules lose transparency and cannot be called into question or changed easily. As a result, computer-based systems often regiment human behavior unnecessarily, reducing decision-making discretion and flexibility.<br\/>Before we can hope to improve design practice so that these shortcomings are addressed by reliable design principles, it is necessary to to understand better how policies become formalized in the first place, what organizational principles in software architecture can be exploited to uncover and modularize policy, and what are the effects of such policy embedding on the flexibility and autonomy of human organizations. These are fundamentally scientific questions whose object of study are the design of the artificial normative<br\/>systems that we call software-intensive systems. Accordingly, the goal of this project is to conduct such a scientific investigation with the aim of informing design practice as a future, not immediate goal.","title":"Policy Modularity: Toward a Science of Socially-Embedded System Design","awardID":"0344004","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2005-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}}],"PIcoPI":[235460],"PO":["564388"]},"86476":{"abstract":"EIA-032550- University of Texas-Austin, Chandrajit L.

While structures of macromolecular complexes are becoming more prevalent, and the size of some density maps would increase up to 1GB, the visualization and analysis requirements to extract important biological information are far beyond the currently available software. Our research task will explore different algorithms to enhance the signal through denoising of the 3-dimensional structure, visualize these large and filtered maps effectively, extract the individual protein components and their salient structural features such as a helices and b sheets accurately, and ultimately construct pseudo atomic model with novel structure prediction methods using protein sequence and structure considerations as constraints. We will set up a test data set, comprised of both simulated and experimental structures, to validate each of our development steps. The software developments in each of the research sites will be glued together using a scripting language (Python) and made easy to use through a graphical interface.

As one moves from<br\/>merely hosting web sites to supporting electronic commerce, banking,<br\/>auctions, health-care, and voting, the ability to prevent malicious<br\/>outsiders, or even malicious insiders, from gaining confidential<br\/>information or manipulating the system becomes increasingly critical.<br\/>Looking to the future, one can expect the evolution of even more complex<br\/>systems, such as digital rights management systems and elaborate single<br\/>sign-on web services, with correspondingly complex security<br\/>requirements.<br\/><br\/>Cryptography is an essential tool for implementing secure distributed<br\/>systems over the Internet: no other technology provides the required<br\/>confidentiality, authentication, or other security properties.<br\/><br\/>Yet using cryptography effectively is surprisingly difficult. While<br\/>there are good candidates for the underlying basic cryptographic<br\/>operations (encryption, digital signatures, etc.), such cryptographic<br\/>primitives by themselves are not sufficient: they need to be utilized<br\/>within a larger framework---a cryptographic protocol---specifying<br\/>exactly how they are to be used in a multi-party distributed system. The<br\/>ability to design and prove secure a cryptographic protocol for a given<br\/>purpose is essential to the secure evolution of our Internet-based<br\/>society; yet our tools for doing so are still surprisingly awkward and<br\/>limited.<br\/><br\/>At the highest level of description, this proposal aims to remedy this<br\/>situation by providing tools and techniques that facilitate the easy<br\/>design and analysis of secure cryptographic protocols.<br\/><br\/>Today, there are two major approaches to protocol design. The first is<br\/>a formal approach pioneered by Dolev and Yao, based on theorem-proving<br\/>and model-checking. This approach offers surprisingly good design<br\/>tools, but at present this approach has a very limited domain of<br\/>applicability, and furthermore the limitations on what an adversary is<br\/>allowed to do in this approach make the analysis only suggestive, rather<br\/>than conclusive, in practice. (That is, a ``proof of security'' for a<br\/>protocol in this formal model doesn't necessarily imply that the<br\/>protocol will be secure in practice.)

The formal<br\/>methods will be enlarged to handle many of the important ``details''<br\/>ordinarily not considered by formal methods, such as error handling and<br\/>algebraic identities. Cryptographic techniques will be used to<br\/>``force'' a real-world adversary to be no more powerful than his<br\/>``formal'' counterpart. The research will proceed by develping<br\/>``compilation'' techniques that enable any protocol proven secure within<br\/>the formal model to be implemented securely in the ``real world'' (that<br\/>is, within the computational model).<br\/><br\/>This research program is challenging; it requires an interdisciplinary<br\/>approach as it crosses boundaries normally respected. Furthermore, <br\/>developing ``generic'' techniques that apply to any protocol is<br\/>necessarily more challenging than the usual procedure of working on<br\/>protocols individually.<br\/><br\/>Broad impact: The results of this research will not only advance the<br\/>academic state of the art, but will also provide practitioners with<br\/>effective tools and technology for making Internet-based society<br\/>increasingly secure.

The system tightly integrates innovations in computer hardware, operating system, data mining, and compiler support. More specifically, our proposed system hinges on the following innovations: (1) low-overhead compiler-directed checking to detect bugs and pass information to the data miner, operating system, and hardware to characterize the bugs; (2) Low-overhead data mining algorithms that build and use models for bug detection, characterization, and correction; (3) Novel hardware support to roll back and deterministically re-execute buggy sections of code with very low overhead and transparently to the user; and (4) operating system support to roll back and re-execute code sections that cannot be supported by hardware.

We hope the work will have a broad impact, since expediting the debugging process can lead to dramatic increases in the productivity of IT professionals and students.

The motivation is that a large sensor network can potentially consist of thousands or tens of thousands of sensors densely populated, with strict energy and complexity constraints. Therefore the design of any protocol or algorithm should come with precision and a quantifiable measure, and be based on a good understanding of the ultimate scalability limit. This proposal aims at bridging the gap between the fundamental limit studies and practical protocol design. The goal of the proposed research is to (1) derive capacity limits critical to the large class of data gathering sensor network applications; (2) develop practical distributed algorithms that use these limits as guidelines and can approach these limits; and (3) examine the actual achievable performance of these algorithms in a real sensor testbed setting. Consequently, there are three parts to the proposed research: fundamental capacity limits, distributed algorithms, and testbed experiments. A central theme of the proposed research is to bridge the gap between the theoretical achievability of fundamental limits and the optimality of practical network designs. The proposed design methodology is thus driven by capacity limit studies via novel modeling techniques. It provides a novel and powerful tool in the study of network scalability and feasibility. <br\/><br\/>Under fundamental capacity limits, will study two capacity notions: the throughput capacity, defined within the context of many-to-one communication as the maximum achievable throughput when all nodes are communicating with a single receiver via either a single hop or multiple hops; and the lifetime capacity, defined as the maximum amount of data deliverable by a sensor network until the first sensor dies (due to energy depletion) or till a pre-specified percentage of sensors die. The study of these two capacity notions has direct implications on organizing communications within a network, e.g., whether clustering should be used and how big a cluster should be, how many data collecting base stations should there be and where should they be placed. This study will progress from simple idealized scenarios to increasingly more realistic and complex. <br\/><br\/>Under distributed algorithms, will apply the capacity analysis to the design of distributed algorithms of energy efficient data dissemination, optimal clustering and efficient sensor sleep schedules. These algorithms will be designed to approach or approximate network capacities. Under the proposed research will also develop an experimental wireless sensor testbed for implementation and measurement purposes. <br\/><br\/>The proposed research has a strong education aspect and involves collaboration with two research centers at the University of Michigan. Will seek close collaboration with the Wireless Integrated Micro-systems (WIMS) Center, an NSF ERC at the University of Michigan, and University of Michigan's Wu Manufacturing Research Center (WuMRC). Will incorporate state-of-the-art MEMS sensors currently being developed at WIMS and intelligent infotronics agent sensors being developed for automation systems by WuMRC into our sensor testbed.

These social rules of movement are rich and complicated, being highly dependent on context and governing both spatial and temporal relationships. The research question at the heart of this project is: can robots utilize cues based on human behavior in deciding when and how to apply the correct rules for social interaction? There are two main components to this question: how to acquire or design the representations of these rules and cues, and how to use this information in a robot's decision-making process. We approach this as a planning problem because a social interaction requires a sequence of actions rather than a one-time, reactive choice. We intend to extend existing decision-theoretic planning methods to semi-Markov models, which can represent more complex relationships between time and state than first order Markov models.<br\/><br\/>This project has potential impact in the research fields of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics as well as impact on numerous modern applications. It can result in making robots more likely to be deployed in environments where their capacity to be embodied information providers is most useful (museum guides, receptionists, helpmates for the elderly, etc.). This project is also promoting education for underrepresented groups like women and minorities.","title":"Decision Theoretic Approaches to Human-Robot Social Interaction","awardID":"0329014","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["539160","551205"],"PO":["335186"]},"87257":{"abstract":"This research is aimed at solving one of the fundamental problems in tele-sensing: the interpretation of information, and determination of the system state, based on noisy and sparse data from sensor grid sources, interconnected with interruptible (wired or wireless) communication channels. Such situations include medical sensing on ambulatory subjects when sensor signals are frequently dominated by motion artifacts at the interface between the sensor and the body. The approach explored in this research combines sensor-level signal processing with adaptive, optimal sampling of data from multiple sensors to reduce\/eliminate motion artifacts and determine reliability\/uncertainty measures for the entire measurement and data communication process.

The method will enable devices that (a) fuse data from multiple, networked, independent sensors in order to derive information about the signal of interest and to characterize interfering noise, (b) use adaptive signal conditioning (adaptive filtering, automatic gain control, etc.) and Optimal Algorithms for data acquisition that are based on characteristics of the signal of interest; and (c) provide quantitative measures of data quality and reliability based on error-minimizing optimal sampling criteria. Motion artifacts, i.e., spurious signals caused by tissue movement and intermittent contact of the sensor with the body surface cause significant errors in the signal being measured and are the most serious and most difficult to eliminate class of errors in medical sensors for use by ambulatory subjects.

This framework extends the notions of PCFGs from 1D word strings to 2D image data and similarly extends the inside-outside algorithm to support training, classification, and parsing on 2D image data with these extended PCFGs.

The research will focus on improving user interaction with speech recognition systems. Previously, the PI developed a novel error specification technique that uses confidence scores to facilitate the recognition error correction process. While earlier efforts by others to use confidence scores for this purpose had largely been unsuccessful, the PI's initial evaluation of his technique has yielded promising results; whereas earlier efforts relied on identifying specific words that were incorrect, the PI's technique can prove beneficial even if it is only possible to identify the regions where errors may exist. In the new project, the PI will integrate confidence scores with techniques from natural language processing, to facilitate the process of correcting recognition errors. He will develop novel interaction techniques and models, that support new interaction scenarios and allow for better understanding of the relationship between users and speech recognition systems. Questions to be addressed include the following: Can we expand existing models to effectively describe interactions between users and speech recognition systems when error correction activities are explicitly separated from dictation? How can we support the process of finding and correcting recognition errors when these activities are temporally separated from dictation? How do the abilities and limitations of individuals (e.g., traditional users and individuals with various disabilities) affect their strategies when completing tasks that involve deferred error correction?<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This research extends an existing collaboration between UMBC's Information Systems Department and the Workforce and Technology Center (WTC).

Unlike previous approaches, our work does not rely on delay as the metric of distance, but rather utilizes the topological and routing structure of the existing Internet to compute distances and create local topologies.

Once installed, each node in the proposed content distribution network (CDN) automatically discovers its location in the Internet, attaches to the control tree of the CDN structure, and finds other nodes in its neighborhood. The information in the control tree contains a scalable aggregation of all independently discovered views of the Internet by the nodes of the CDN network. Using this control tree, the nodes quickly build an overlapping set of neighborhood meshes that reach the main data server. Arriving end-users are efficiently directed to the nearest cache based on their location in the Internet and network clusters already discovered by the individual cache nodes. To avoid packet loss and to control the flows along the branches of the multicast tree, we investigate new congestion control methods for video streaming that allow smooth playback and remain stable under delayed feedback from the network. <br\/><br\/>CDNs emerged as a crucial part of the existing web infrastructure and already improve the response time, as well as the throughput, of many Internet downloads. Future CDNs that support video streaming will deliver a scalable platform for distributing live and pre-recorded video programs to end-users and will greatly improve the current ability of the society to disseminate information. <br\/><br\/>The proposed research activities will be integrated in the network course curriculum. This will enable students to gain deep understanding of the architectural design issues related to peer-to-peer networking and content distribution networks.","title":"ITR: Efficient Self-Organizing Content Distribution Network for Scalable Video Streaming Services","awardID":"0312461","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["550669"],"PO":["565090"]},"83661":{"abstract":"The ``last-mile'' broadband problem is arguably the most important long-standing techno-economic challenge faced by the telecommunications industry. Grassroots community wireless networks are emerging in various parts of the world as an interesting paradigm to connect a community of users to the nearest broadband wire. Community wireless networks (CWNs) have a number of characteristics distinctly different from both mobile ad-hoc wireless networks (MANETs) and traditional IP-based internetworks (eg: OSPF\/IS-IS\/BGP routed networks). They can also leverage a variety of low-cost capabilities available in residential areas to dramatically simplify configuration and boost effective network capacity. Our project focuses primarily on leveraging the design freedom made possible due to these differences. <br\/><br\/>Technical Merit: The PIs propose an broad experimental research program into the community wireless network (CWN) concept. The research will be conducted in the context of an operational medium-scale community network to be built in Troy, NY (upto 100 nodes in a 1 mile radius around RPI campus) and in collaboration with a commercial 802.11 access network provider in Harrisburg, PA<br\/>(see attached letter of support). PIs divide our proposed investigation into the following parts:<br\/><br\/>First, at the physical\/link layer we focus on the problem of auto-configuration and network capacity maximization. PIs propose to use a mix of cheap 802.11b, 802.11a and 802.11g links, leverage the directionality of streets, the GPS (latitude\/longitude) location of homes, and the availability of backup channels (eg: telephone line or 915 Mhz ISM band radios for remote auto-configuration) to simplify the setup of nodes. The proposed hardware\/software design combined with real-world deployment is a unique feature of our proposal.<br\/><br\/>Second, at the routing layer, The PIs will develop a broad framework and mechanisms for efficient explicit\/multi-path routing using existing routing protocols (eg: OSPF, BGP-4, MANET protocols like DSR etc). Within this framework, PIs will investigate a number of hybrid geographic and topologically-informed routing to seamlessly interconnect organically evolving community wireless networks. <br\/><br\/>Third, PIs propose to model the growth and evolution of the network; develop strategies to characterize and improve the robustness against node failures. Finally, PIs will measure and characterize the real traffic and usage patterns of the operational community wireless network in the Troy, NY area from its earliest stages of deployment.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: The proposed research will provide real-world experimental validation of the nascent community wireless network (CWN) concept, and make significant contributions to the architecture of last-mile wireless networks, routing, traffic engineering and growth modeling of wireless networks. The project will involve the RPI ACM undergraduate chapter (see attached letter) and a large number of undergraduate students in the research. It will also be used as a context for term-projects in the RPI networking curriculum.

The project is planned as a collaborative, multi-disciplinary effort involving Duke University and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

A smart antenna system also has the ability to change its directionality in response to the environment. The main contribution of this project will be in the design and simulation of practical MANET systems making use of smart antennas. In particular, this research effort will build a new model for MANET system study based upon thorough multi-layer modeling of realistic system operation. While cross-layer optimizations have been considered across higher-level layers (including the application layer), little research effort has gone into optimizing the physical layer for improved higher layer functionality. Meeting dynamic Quality of Service (QoS) requirements in MANETs as well as increasing scalability, security, and energy efficiency are recognized cross-layer MANET design issues that can be enabled by the proposed research. Numerous theoretical developments in the area of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems provide an opportunity to characterize MANETs in which nodes make use of smart antennas at both ends of the communications link. Through this project, a relationship will be established between antenna designs, antenna placements, scattering environments, and MIMO channel capacities on MANET links in actual systems. Space-time coding techniques and beamforming strategies will need to be coupled, for the first time, with dynamic neighbor discovery algorithms to create and maintain ad-hoc links in a dynamic propagation environment. The user density, mobility, and channel characteristics unique to dense urban environments and hybrid indoor\/outdoor environments will be taken into account when designing these MANET links. Finally, this project will develop novel routing algorithms that will consider the unique requirements imposed, and the potential advantages gained, by the use of smart antennas.

Pairwise sequence comparison is the ``killer app'' of bioinformatics. In this task, the user queries a protein database with a single sequence, and the algorithm returns a ranked list of sequences that<br\/>are likely to be evolutionarily related to the query. Two sequences that are descended from a common ancestral sequence - even though their sequence similarity may be subtle -- are likely to have similar three-dimensional structures and fill similar functional roles in the cell. Hence, recognizing subtle sequence similarities is useful for inferring protein evolution, function and structure.<br\/><br\/>Almost all existing algorithms for pairwise sequence comparison fall into one of two categories: heuristic alignment algorithms that are scalable to large databases but can fail to capture subtle protein similarities; and approaches based on protein family models, which are accurate for determining whether a sequence fits a particular family model but cannot evaluate similarity between two unannotated proteins. The popular PSI-BLAST algorithm is a hybrid of the two approaches: it tries to iteratively build a model from a single query sequence on the fly and then searches the database for sequences that fit the model. While efficient, PSI-BLAST is known not to be the most accurate method for detecting more remote protein relationships.<br\/><br\/>The approach that we pursue in this proposal is fundamentally new: we use machine learning algorithms to train offline on examples from the full space of proteins, both those with family annotations and unannotated <br\/>sequences, so that at run-time, our trained model can accurately predict which database sequences are related to the query. In other words, we want to introduce learning into the general sequence comparison problem, without resorting to a more limited family-based model approach. One primary goal of this research is the development of algorithms that exploit the additional or hidden structure of the problem. To this end, we experiment with a number of learning algorithms, including constrained clustering, neighborhood averaging, use of hierarchical labels and ensembles of classifiers, techniques for dimensionality reduction like non-negative matrix factorization, and kernel-based semi-supervised approaches.<br\/><br\/>In addition to algorithm development, we plan to produce a software implementation and web interface that will make our techniques available to the biological community. Throughout our research, we will emphasize techniques that are scalable. We want the actual prediction time to be fast, so that a user can enter a new<br\/>query sequence and retrieve a ranked list of related sequences from the database in real time via a web interface. Thus we focus on two features: training offline, which allows us to take advantage of more expensive computation in the training process so that the predictions can be fast; and use of fast string kernels, a technique from our work on protein classification that will enable run-time speed-up. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts. Pairwise sequence comparison is a central problem in bioinformatics and genomics, and our techniques for improving performance and scalability of protein sequence comparison through state-of-the-art machine learning techniques will be broadly useful to biologists and bioinformaticians. The software implementation and web interface that we will produce as part of our proposal will make our techniques available to the biological community. All specifications, datasets, and results from our research will be made publicly available via our web site. All new algorithms will also be described in publications for dissemination to the machine learning community. Finally, we note that the learning challenges of our sequence comparison problem -- for example, learning in a setting with a large amount of unlabelled data and only a small amount of labelled data -- occur in many other applied areas of machine learning, such as text classification and information retrieval. Thus our research will have impact in many applied learning and data-driven fields.","title":"ITR: Machine learning approaches to protein sequence comparison: discriminative, semi-supervised, scalable algorithms","awardID":"0312706","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["393337","384160"],"PO":["565136"]},"82385":{"abstract":"Millions of users of information retrieval systems each day seek useful items, but many are frustrated with the results received.

Thus, by using long sequences and PKI to exchange a secret key with the FPGA while also encrypting the executable with that secret key, a system can be positioned at the high-security (but low-performance) end of the spectrum. Similarly, as will be explained in the proposal, by using shorter sequences and selective encryption, one can achieve high-performance with higher security than is possible with systems that rely only on obscurity.","title":"ITR: A Hardware\/Compiler Co-Design Approach to Software Protection","awardID":"0325207","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["560392","381672","562052","559652"],"PO":["529429"]},"86411":{"abstract":"Wisconsin Semantic Disks (WISE)<br\/><br\/>Abstract<br\/><br\/>In the Wisconsin Semantic disks project (WiSe Disks), we will develop the core technology required to build semantically smart disk systems.

These technologies are finding applications in emerging areas such as intellectual property protection, media authentication, database indexing, broadcast encryption, broadcast monitoring, and covert communications. The application areas are expanding: they also include communication problems such as broadcast channels and wireless communications.<br\/>While the development of these technologies has largely been heuristic, recent research has demonstrated<br\/>the feasibility of a more scientific approach rooted in information theory. This project expands this scientific framework and explores the multiple fundamental connections between the signal embedding applications listed above. One central theme is the role of binning schemes for information transmission; random binning schemes are known to be capacity-achieving in problems of communications with side information at the encoder and\/or decoder. Yet these analyses are based on restrictive assumptions (such as coherent communication channels) which have limited the practical applicability of binning schemes so far. <br\/>The second central theme of this project is the premise that security requirements impose constraints which are naturally addressed by a complexity-based cryptographic approach rather than a purely information-theoretic or decision-theoretic approach. This project develops a systematic framework for integrating the information-theoretic and the cryptographic aspects of secure signal embedding problems.<br\/>This project is highly multidisciplinary and involves a synergy between research and educational activities in signal processing, communications, coding theory, information theory, and cryptography.","title":"Collaborative Research: ITR: Secure Signal Embedding -- Code Design and Cryptanalysis","awardID":"0325311","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["550026","521731"],"PO":["564898"]},"86312":{"abstract":"This project, a collaborative with 03-24977 Kostas Daniilidis at University of Pennsylvania and 03-25017 Joel Burdick at California Institute of Technology, addresses research issues key to an important application of robot teams and information technology (emergency response in hazardous environments for various tasks).

Sinai School of Medicine<br\/><br\/>Project Summary<br\/><br\/>This project is an investigation of computational problems that arise for a new type of discrete pattern in DNA sequences, the composition pattern.<br\/>Composition is a vector quantity describing the frequency of occurrence of each alphabet letter in a particular string. Let S be a string over E.Then, C (S) =(f1; f2; pH j _ j) is the composition of S, wherefore 2 _, fi is the fraction of the characters in S that are i. A composition pattern is a string P = r1r2 _ _ _ rp, where RI represents a composition region i.e. a substring of homogenous composition which differs from that of its surrounding regions. Note that the order of letters in RI is irrelevant, as it has no effect on the composition of RI. To date, algorithms which characterize DNA functional sites have concentrated primarily on identifying what this proposal terms position-specific patterns, such as the consensus sequence or the<br\/>more flexible, but less specific weight matrix based pattern profile. Unfortunately, position-specific patterns are usually not selective enough to distinguish actual occurrences of a feature from false positives. Too often, when these patterns are used to search for unknown matches, one to several orders of magnitude more false positives than true positives are obtained. The composition pattern is a new approach which embraces an important physical property, the potential for variation in structural conformation (shape) of the DNA double helix, yet does so in the context of a type of discrete pattern which has apparently not been previously explored by the algorithmic community. DNA crystallization studies support the idea that certain dinucleotides base-steps confer specific types of flexibility. Further evidence is provided by studies of intrinsically curved and `kinkable' DNA. Based on these observations, it is suggested here that for conformational flexibility, the order of nucleotides in a sequence may be less important than the effect, which certain nucleotide or dinucleotide base-step biases impart on the sequence as a whole. In support of this assertion is an accumulating body of evidence of important DNA features whose unifying characteristic is composition bias rather than position-specific information. This research project encompasses algorithm development for three related problem areas which form the basis for understanding the functional importance of composition variation in nucleotide sequences and the detection of composition patterns. These areas are:<br\/><br\/>Pattern matching. A composition pattern and sequence are given. Find all occurrences of the pattern in the sequence. Occurrences may be exact or approximate.<br\/><br\/>Pattern detection. A sequence or set of sequences is given. Find all recurring composition patterns. Occurrences may be exact or approximate. The patterns are not specified or only partially specified<br\/>Sequence segmentation. A sequence is given. Partition it into statistically distinct regions of homogenous composition. These problems have theoretical interest in their own right, independent of biology and have received almost no attention from the algorithmic community.","title":"Composition Patterns in Nucleotide Sequences","awardID":"0413463","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2004-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["451346"],"PO":["543507"]},"86323":{"abstract":"Much of human intelligence can be broadly characterized as the ability to identify patterns and the visual system is the most sophisticated pattern finding mechanism that we have.

Information visualization exploits aspects of the human perceptual system to recognize salient facts, correlations, and features of a complex information space. By presenting visualizations in real time, allows users to relate system security to their own actions, and thereby gain a deeper understanding of how security can be enhanced-or compromised-as a part of their experience of using computer systems. Visualization offers a means by which one can incorporate information about system security into all aspects of computer system use. This is critically important since the security of information in a networked computer system depends on the interrelationships between many different systems, components, and applications; there is no one point of control. Any successful approach must be comprehensive.<br\/>A concern with security is not with mathematical abstraction but with practical reality. There is a disparity between theoretical security and effective security in day-to-day computing. Theoretical security is the level of information security one can achieve in theory, using strong encryption, zero-knowledge systems, and the current state of the art. On the other hand, effective security is the actual level of information security one can achieve in practice. A system can have high theoretical security but low effective security when the security mechanisms are implemented in ways that confuse or confound users.<br\/>In his classic article \"Why Cryptosystems Fail,\" Ross Anderson (1993) outlines two paradigms for system security. One is the \"automation\" paradigm, in which the work of managing information security is automated and embedded in the machinery of the system. The other is the \"facilitation\" paradigm, in which humans can monitor and managing the security process, adapting it to changing needs and circumstances. He argues that many security failures have their roots in the inherent brittleness of the dominant automation paradigm. However, for regular users, the design of conventional applications and interfaces systematically undermines the facilitation approach. The proposed research addresses this problem with an approach to visualizing system security. This work is not simply applying usability principles to security applications; rather, it is about making security a part of the regular user experience.<br\/>This work builds on the investigators' existing explorations in system architecture, software system visualization, and end-user understandings of security. The combination of these, however, yields an infrastructure that is not only technological novel but also holds significant promise for making the growing cyber-infrastructure accessible and secure for everyday use. On a scientific level, this research makes novel contributions in four areas: the mental models of Internet users, the use of visualization technologies for software system monitoring, the use of event architectures for interactive systems, and the relationship between user models and system architecture. In addition the project will develop an experimental infrastructure that the research community can exploit for research into interactive visualization and security. At a broader level, this research offers significant benefits to society at large. The impact of the Internet as a cultural and economic phenomenon is hard to overstate, and yet the current mechanisms that support users' secure exchange of information are brittle. A resolution to this problem is pressing, and is the goal of this research.","title":"ITR: Usable Security: Towards a Trustable Information Infrastructure","awardID":"0326105","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["483634","464219"],"PO":["563751"]},"86213":{"abstract":"The goal of this project is to build a new infrastructure, called DataMotion, for managing and analyzing large volumes of dynamic and diverse data.

Despite noteworthy efforts to build infrastructure and clever protocols to network these power-limited devices in order to push their operational envelopes for specific applications, a fundamental rather than an incremental understanding of the system performance limits of large-scale robust networks remains far from mature. It is a daunting system theory challenge to push the fundamental frontiers of sensor networks. It is this grand challenge that is the focus of this research. This study addresses scaling laws and robustness issues, but more importantly, aims at concrete design guidelines and algorithmic prescriptions. In short, this effort provides the much-needed systems theory expertise to make large-scale robust sensor networks a reality. <br\/><br\/>The overarching themes are (i) large scale, and (ii) robustness of sensor networks. Sensor networks are unique in that channel physics and sensor source models fundamentally underpin the sensor signals being acquired, processed, and distributed across the network for decision-making and control. Accordingly, channel physicsdrives scaling laws and percolates through all functional tasks. Percolation theory is used to study scaling laws and dictate designs for robust network connectivity. Sampling theory, is studied in a fundamental way to to address robustness versus performance tradeoffs between sensor oversampling density and per-sensor A\/D precision under local communication constraints. Finally, this research ``closes the loop'' around sensor networks by studying distributed inference and robust control based on partial data using hybrid systems theory. <br\/><br\/>This collaborative research effort is organized into three highly coupled functional categories: <br\/><br\/>(i) Large-scale sensor network design guidelines: channel physics and percolation theory. <br\/><br\/>(ii) Sensor field representation and data acquisition: distributed sampling theory. <br\/><br\/>(iii) Distributed inference under communication constraints and robust adaptive control.","title":"SENSORS: Towards a system theory for the robust design of large-scale","awardID":"0330514","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}}],"PIcoPI":["527040",228546,"526900","521731","523728"],"PO":["564898"]},"88886":{"abstract":"A perennial problem in designing information systems is enabling them to cope with continuous evolution. This problem manifests itself in many settings, including software management, configuration management and web-page evolution. The problem is particularly important as information systems are being designed (or re-designed) with a web-centered (typically XML-based) focus. The objective of this project is to extend database technology to better support the design and development of information systems that gracefully adapt to changes. Therefore, database systems must be extended with the ability to (i) manage and query efficiently temporal\/historical information, (ii) support version control for data sets and software artifacts, and (iii) unify management of data and metadata and reduce the problem of configuration management to that of temporal querying and version retrieval. The approach proposed to this challenging problem exploits XML ability to unify data and metadata and support powerful query languages. The evolution of information systems -- their data, metadata, and software artifacts -- is thus unified and modeled by time-stamped XML documents. The project will test the newly defined capabilities to be tested in a pilot study, where an existing information system for resume management and job placement are re-designed for evolution. Experiments based on past and planned changes, are used to validate the effectiveness of the solutions developed in the project.

For example, in the management succession scenario, the essential information is the person, position, company name and date of management changes. The extraction process requires substantial scenario-dependent knowledge, and for most systems, this knowledge is currently created by hand. This laborious task, which sometimes takes months, is a major obstacle to the wider use of IE. The objective of this project is to fully automate the creation of scenario dependent knowledge. In the system under development, the user only specifies the scenario, and the system creates the knowledge needed to extract the information. This is being accomplished through the development of four components: <br\/>1) A broad-coverage name tagger, which identifies and classifies a wide variety of names and numeric expressions. It uses bootstrapping and active learning to overcome the sparseness problem.<br\/>2) Unsupervised learning of IE patterns and the associated word classes. <br\/>3) Automatic paraphrase discovery to find relationships between IE patterns. This uses comparable corpora and automatic identification of comparable phrases based on anchors such as names.<br\/>4) Discovery of rules for integrating information and building the table.<br\/><br\/>This research will result in the creation of a new paradigm for IE. On-demand IE will provide useful and concise access to the information in text collections in a wide range of scenarios. We will make the knowledge and the systems available to the public after it has been shown to be successful. High-performance, rapidly portable extraction systems would have a major impact on the ways in which we can exploit textual knowledge, both everyday news and the scientific and technical literature.

While progress has been made toward identifying molecular mechanisms through which cells create and respond to communication signals, it is less well understood how cell communication networks function as integrated units. To address this need, we have devised an experimental system that enables us to observe the dynamics of cell-cell communication in vitro. Specifically, we track the progressive development of an anti-viral state in cells as they respond to signals produced by virus-infected cells. Our long term goal is to build an integrated molecular-level understanding of this process. Toward this end, we propose here to formulate and refine an initial model for the process. The model will incorporate and integrate information at multiple levels using structured cell population balances. At the intracellular level these balances will allow us to account for the kinetics of virus growth, signal production, and the inhibitory effects of signal on a single-cycle of virus growth. At the extracellular level, the balances will account for the spatial spread by diffusion of signals and virus progeny, the effects of signaling on resources in uninfected cells, and, finally, the gradual attenuation of virus spatial propagation distributed over many cycles of virus growth. The model will build primarily on established molecular mechanisms drawn from the literature, and it will be refined by experiments we perform on single-cycle virus growth and spatially spreading virus infections. Our model will be used to identify parameters or groups to parameters that govern the effects of cell-cell signaling on virus containment. Further, it will serve as a foundation to identify novel anti-viral strategies based on an integrated systems-level understanding of cell and virus dynamics. <br\/><br\/>Broader impact: This proposed study is highly interdisciplinary. It will employ computer simulations to characterize the intra- and extracellular dynamics of virus growth and cell-cell signaling. The cross-disciplinary experience gained by students and co-workers who pursue this research, as well as the textbook sections, refereed publications, technical presentations and course materials that result from this work, will advance research and education in cell-cell communication and, more broadly, in systems biology.","title":"QSB: Integrated Dynamics of Cell-cell Communication","awardID":"0331337","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1629","name":"BE: NON-ANNOUNCEMENT RESEARCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1705","name":"BIOLOGY & INFORMATION TECHNOLO"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7353","name":"EMERGING MODELS & TECHNOLOGIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0709","name":"Division of BIOENGINEERING & ENVIRON SYSTE","abbr":"BES"},"pgm":{"id":"1491","name":"BIOTECH, BIOCHEM & BIOMASS ENG"}}],"PIcoPI":["523876","299213"],"PO":["521045"]},"87247":{"abstract":"Tagging animals with miniature electronic instruments provides unique opportunities to observe physiology, movements, and social behavior in a free-ranging context. The addition of environmental sensors to animal tags provides the capacity to monitor ecological and oceanographic processes, and the animals can be viewed as self- sustaining autonomous vehicles that focus sampling effort on regions of biological interest. Although some scenarios permit recovery of the tags, a much broader domain of applications requires telemetry of data from the tags, usually using radio frequency signals. Radio tags confront conflicting demands: minimization of transmit power to enable extended operations with small batteries, and maximization of the area over which the tags can be tracked.<br\/> In the current systems for marine animal (e.g., whales) data acquisition, the attached (implanted) radio tags measure data about the animals and their environments and store the data in memory as packets. When the animal surfaces in view of a satellite, this data is transmitted to the satellite where the biologist can retrieve it. Once the packet is transmitted to the satellite, it may be deleted from storage on the animal-implanted device. The devices on animals transmit at preset intervals to the satellite. <br\/> However, the use of the satellite system accepts certain limitations: substantial transmission power requirements, high cost, and probable limits on connections, because satellites may not always be in view. The last problem may prove serious if the tags cannot transmit at any time. Many marine mammal species have dive durations exceeding 30 minutes, and may spend less than 15% of their time on the surface. Moreover, the cost and energy consumption are critical issues due to the low battery power of the implants. <br\/> In this proposal, the proposer advocate a different approach: the infrastructure is extended to the animals (mobile nodes) by the mobile nodes themselves, by creating a sensor network infrastructure composed of the animal tags. The information that is created in a network node is allowed to be diffused (replicated) among the nodes, as the nodes come into contact due to their mobility. In other words, as a node comes into reception distance from another node, the information stored in the memory of the node is replicated and stored in the memory of the recipient node. An information collecting station is placed within the animal habitat, and when an animal comes within the reception range if a collecting station, all stored information in the memory of that animal tag is offloaded to the collecting station. To increase the probability that the information is recovered from the network, a number of collecting stations can be distributed throughout the habitat. Thus, only one of each information piece needs to reach only one collecting station to be successfully offloaded. The propoer term this networking model the Ad Hoc Infostation model. <br\/> As part of the research, it propose to address three areas: research into the design and performance evaluation of the Ad Hoc Infostation model, development of a practical sensor tag that would operate in a network of Ad Hoc Infostations, and integration of the sensor tag into a network of Ad Hoc Infostations.<br\/> In particular, examples of topics address under the first area include design of the network of Ad Hoc Infostations to reach the terrestrial network, networks that include a hierarchy of different-mobility nodes, such as those that include mobile Ad Hoc Infostations, and examination of the \"capacity-delay\" tradeoff offered by the Ad Hoc Infostation model. In their work, plan on using the vast knowledge in epidemic modeling to leverage from in studying the Ad Hoc Infostation model. <br\/> Under the second area, a new transceiver tag will be developed, which will support all of the RF capabilities needed for the wireless Ad Hoc Infostation networking nodes. <br\/>Under the third area, the tags and Ad Hoc Infostation receivers will be tested locally, and evaluated in two pilot projects to assess their biological utility. Initial functional tests will be conducted by setting up Ad Hoc Infostations in the local Tompkins Country, and driving tags around to simulate animal movements. The second project will utilize the networking capabilities to gather bioacoustic data from a matrix of dispersed fixed sensors. <br\/> As the broader impact of the proposal, whales and other marine mammals are crucial to several marine environmental issues and improved understanding of the factors that enable prediction marine mammal distributions, and of the responses of marine mammals to anthropogenic noise, is a long0term research priority of naval research.

An integrated molecular sensor consists minimally of two components: the recognition element that binds to the target molecule (analyte), and the signal transducer that converts the binding event into a readable signal. The recognition element will be derived from the aforementioned combinatorial libraries. These libraries will be generated either through genetic engineering for proteins or through chemical synthesis for DNA. The assumption is that at least some of the library members will fold into a three-dimensional structure that is complementary to some part of the target. Controlled in vitro selection procedures will then be used to isolate members of the libraries that bind to a particular target, namely the ricin A-chain protein, with high affinity. <br\/><br\/>The broader impacts of this research are several-fold. While much of the work proposed is of a fundamental nature, the target molecule to be used in the selections, the ricin A-chain protein is of immediate relevance. This target is important due to recently heightened concerns about the use of the ricin toxin, which includes the A-chain, in bioterrorism and biowarfare. Moreover, the methods to be developed for constructing integrated molecular sensors can be applied to many other targets. Functional sensors for use in the clinic and the field can be realized from this research.

In addition to the expected academic year efforts, graduate student mentors and undergraduate students will be recruited for a special summer research team that will spend ten weeks working in a highly collaborative, multidisciplinary environment.","title":"SENSORS: Integrated Molecular Sensors Derived from Combinatorial Protein and DNA Libraries","awardID":"0330135","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1705","name":"BIOLOGY & INFORMATION TECHNOLO"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0709","name":"Division of BIOENGINEERING & ENVIRON SYSTE","abbr":"BES"},"pgm":{"id":"1491","name":"BIOTECH, BIOCHEM & BIOMASS ENG"}}],"PIcoPI":["546049",228397,"535481"],"PO":["521045"]},"89216":{"abstract":"This proposal presents a framework for reliable concurrent programming based on interface-based specification and verification of concurrency controllers. Proposed specification and verification techniques for concurrency controllers are modularized by decoupling behavior and interface specifications.

The interface specification is a finite state machine whose transitions represent actions. Con-currency controllers can be designed modularly by composing their interfaces. The proposed approach separates the verification of the concurrency controllers (behavior verification) from the verification of the threads, which use them (interface verification). For behavior verification it is possible to use symbolic and infinite-state verification techniques, which enables verification of controllers with parameterized constants, unbounded variables and arbitrary number of client threads. For interface verification it is possible to use explicit state program verification techniques, which enables verification of arbitrary thread implementations without any restrictions. The correctness of the user threads can be verified using stubs generated from the concurrency controller interfaces, which improves the efficiency of the thread verification significantly.

The syntax of a seed language (MSA) is automatically extracted from an existing treebank and is augmented by hand as needed, while the syntax of related dialects is specified manually to the extent that it differs from that of other dialects. A similar approach is pursued for morphology and the lexicon. These formal specifications are then used to derive transducers among the dialects. To test the utility of this approach, the transducers are used to convert MSA corpora to (an approximation of) dialect text. These \"created\" corpora in turn are used to train language models for the dialect, with the expectation of improving dialect ASR over the baseline in which only small dialect corpora or (large) MSA corpora are used for language modeling.<br\/><br\/>The project has the potential to improve the quality of ASR for Arabic dialects and, more generally, to increase the understanding of how closely related languages can be modeled formally. The developed NLP tools for Arabic dialects will be made available to the research community.","title":"Arabic Dialect Modeling for Speech and Natural Language Processing","awardID":"0329163","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7274","name":"HUMAN LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["507533"],"PO":["565215"]},"88149":{"abstract":"This collaborative research proposal is focused on the creation of a large-scale wireless network testbed which will facilitate a broad range of experimental research on next-generation protocols and application concepts. It is recognized that powerful technology and market trends towards portable computing and communication imply an increasingly important role for wireless access in the next-generation Internet. At the same time, new sensor and pervasive computing applications are expected to drive large-scale deployments of embedded computing devices interconnected via new types of short-range wireless networks. The speed of technology innovation in the wireless networking field can be significantly increased with the development of a flexible, open-access wireless network testbed that can be shared by experimental researchers across the networking community.<br\/><br\/>The proposed ORBIT (Open Access Research Testbed for Next-Generation Wireless Networks) system is a two-tier laboratory emulator\/field trial network testbed designed to achieve reproducibility of experimentation, while also supporting evaluation of protocols and applications in real-world settings. In particular, the laboratory-based wireless network emulator will be constructed using a novel approach involving a large two-dimensional grid of static and mobile 802.11x radio nodes which can be dynamically interconnected into specified topologies with reproducible wireless channel models. All radio devices in the system provide open API's that permit end-users to download radio link, MAC and network layer protocols to construct a specific networking scenario. Once the basic protocol or application concepts have been validated on the lab emulator platform, users can migrate their experiments to the field test network which provides a configurable mix of both high-speed cellular (3G) and 802.11x wireless access in a real-world setting. Extensive measurement tools will be provided to support research evaluation, including both network traffic and radio link\/spectrum usage aspects.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the development of the ORBIT wireless testbed infrastructure, this project includes a comprehensive set of \"experimental work packages\" intended to generate design requirements and serve as end-user application drivers for the system being developed.

The wireless network testbed will be developed and operated by Rutgers WINLAB, using facilities located at the Rutgers New Brunswick campus and at partner sites in the area. The testbed will be available for remote or on-site access by other research groups nationally, subject to NSF guidelines for use. Additional partners will be sought during the course of the program both for testbed infrastructure development and for research collaboration.<br\/><br\/>The scientific\/technical merits of the proposed project are: advancing the state-of-the-art in design and<br\/>implementation of flexible and scalable wireless network testbeds, and experimental investigation of novel<br\/>architectures, protocols and service concepts for next-generation wireless networks.

The 3-day conference will bring together researchers from North America, Europe and Asia to present and discuss the latest multi-disciplinary work on multimodal interfaces, systems, and applications. The conference represents the growing interest in next-generation perceptive, adaptive and multimodal user interfaces. These new interfaces are especially well suited for interpreting natural communication and activity patterns in real-world environments; their emergence represents a radical departure from previous computing, and is rapidly transforming the nature of human-computer interaction by creating more natural, expressively powerful, flexible and robust means of interacting with computers.

This is a problem for individuals with severe and irregular visual limitations that cannot be corrected through traditional mechanisms such as eyeglasses or contact lenses. In this project the PI will explore the possibility of having the computer generate modified displays to correct conditions such as keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration, Terrien's marginal degeneration, and related refraction disorders that distort the images perceived by the eye in asymmetrical and irregular ways. The irregularity of the distortion introduced by these conditions is captured by the need to include higher-order (i.e., >2) terms in the Zernike polynomial approximation of the eye's wavefront aberration (WA) function, which represents the distortion of images through the optical components of the eye (cornea, lens). Recent advances in image processing and optometry, as well as the continued promise of increasing computing power for real-time applications, make it possible to envision a computer system that, given the proper characterization of the visual capabilities of its user, will generate a display that matches his\/her vision limitations in a complementary way, thus overcoming the user's vision problem. Furthermore, instruments capable of accurately characterizing a person's WA are now commercially available. The PI and his team will use the point-spread function (PSF), obtained from a person's WA, to pre-compensate (by deconvolution) the images shown on the computer screen, so that they are perceived undistorted by the individual whose PSF is considered.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This project will lead to the design of novel assistive technologies, which in turn may well lead to tools that benefit the population at large. A substantial impact on education is also to be expected, due to the large number of students who will participate in the project and in light of the fact that the PI's institution is one of the few minority institutions in the nation with comprehensive programs through the PhD level. The deconvolution work has the potential for broad impact in both technical and societal dimensions, in that it constitutes a novel approach to compensation of images for visual correction purposes via digital rather than optical means, and in consideration of estimates that higher-order visual impairment neglected in traditional solutions may affect as many as 7,000,000 Americans who have excessively irregular refractive errors.","title":"On-Screen Deconvolution to Facilitate Computer Access for Users with Visual Impairments Involving Higher-Order Wavefront Aberrations","awardID":"0308155","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6846","name":"UNIVERSAL ACCESS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6850","name":"DIGITAL SOCIETY&TECHNOLOGIES"}}],"PIcoPI":["558105","333704","435839"],"PO":["565227"]},"83673":{"abstract":"The dynamic data driven estimation of 3D human shape and motion from optical sensors (cameras)<br\/>is a fundamental problem that has many applications such as non-invasive security and monitoring<br\/>systems and human-computer interaction.

Furthermore, available training data often does not match the recognition task in style and domain, which particularly affects the language modeling component in an ASR system.<br\/><br\/>This project is aimed at developing ways of artificially generating language model training data for ASR. Specifically, statistical machine translation (SMT) models are used to produce task-specific data from different but related data representing, for example, a different speech style, dialect, or domain. First, SMT models are trained on a small amount of parallel in-domain and out-of-domain data. The trained model is then applied to a larger set of out-of-domain data. Finally, the 'translated' output is filtered with respect to its relevance to the target task. In addition to using existing SMT models for data generation, a new type of SMT model is introduced in which words are represented as collections of features. This results in a factorized probability model that can be estimated more robustly than a standard model. In this project the above strategy is used to create training data for conversational speech from written text. It is evaluated by comparison with standard language model adaptation and training methods.<br\/><br\/>This technique is expected to significantly reduce the requirements for task-specific data when developing or porting an ASR system to a new recognition task.

Deriving and understanding their fast algorithms has been and continues to be a major research thrust. It is well known that the DFT can be characterized in the framework of the representation theory of cyclic groups. This connection provides deep insight into the DFT and, more importantly, provides the tools to understand, concisely derive, and analyze its fast algorithms. The first goal of this research is to develop the corresponding algebraic framework for other transforms, in particular, for the sixteen discrete trignometric transforms (DTT): the eight discrete cosine transforms and eight discrete sine transforms. The investigators characterize the DTTs in the framework of representation theory of polynomial algebras and develop the theory and the methods to derive the DTTs fast algorithms by manipulating algebras rather than transform matrix entries. This algebraic approach addresses one of the large voids in the theory of DSP algorithms: despite the numerous publications on fast DTT algorithms there is yet no general theory that explains why these algorithms exist or that gives insight into their structure. The research will develop a comprehensive algebraic framework for the DTT algorithms that will provide a concise and transparent derivation of their fast algorithms. More importantly, the algebraic approach is the appropriate framework to discover new algorithms that have not been found with conventional methods--recently, the new class of Cooley-Tukey FFT like DCT algorithms was derived by the investigators using these algebraic methods. <br\/><br\/>The second goal of the research is to extend the connection between algebra and signal processing transforms beyond the derivation of fast algorithms to consider the fundamental question of to what extent is transform-based signal processing algebraic.

The COURSELab system development is to be highly scalable and cost effective, extensible to many disciplines, modifiable and multipurpose, and capable of reaching a broad group of diverse users.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit of this project lies in its innovative approach, the use of MMOG technology applied to learning. The project has the potential to contribute to the research base in human computer interaction as well as on MMOG technologies and online learning environments. Collaboratively designing, conducting, discussing, and interpreting experiments is a promising approach to blending communities of learners into communities of practice.<br\/><br\/>The broader impacts center around the highly scalable and cost effective design. The environment can thus reach broad groups of users and increase the opportunities for individuals to participate in scientific endeavors while simultaneously overcoming many of the limitations imposed by traditional lecture settings using online resources. This research should bring creative and engaging developments from education, business, entertainment, and technological worlds together to focus on providing access to quality laboratory investigations in a cost effective and equitable manner and should provide guidance for future virtual learning environment projects that use the multi-user approach.","title":"ITR\/EIA: Adapting Massively Multi-user Technologies for Collaborative Online Interactive Science Laboratories","awardID":"0325211","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":[225777,225778,"552321"],"PO":["564181"]},"86412":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>0325269<br\/>Ana Anton<br\/>North Carolina State<br\/><br\/>Objectives: The objectives of the proposed work are to (a) develop a framework and software tools that support policy and requirements specification, run-time privacy enforcement and end-user privacy management, and (b) conduct surveys of members of the public who use IT systems for information transactions to investigate their perceptions of rights, permissions and obligations.<br\/>Results: There are three main expected results of this work. First, tools will be produced to aid policy makers in determining the ramifications of policy changes to ensure that, as policy evolves, conflicts and inconsistencies may be prevented. Second, tools will be produced to aid organizations as they enforce and verify policy compliance.<br\/>Third, tools will be produced to empower end-users to manage their own privacy. Intellectual Merit Claims: This work aims to bridge two cultures of scholarship and research: technical specification and privacy policy. Specifications of systems typically concentrate on system-level entities (e.g. cookies), whereas policy discussions emphasize fundamental rights discursively. This proposal will formulate a framework ontology of rights, permissions and obligations (RPO) based on rigorous models of obligation and action<br\/>similar to those previously used by the Co-PI in research into requirements specification, but informed also by the best current models from formal jurisprudence. The proposed surveys of user views about RPOs concerning personal information in the healthcare domain are informed by the PI's previous work in methodologies of goal refinement in e-commerce and other applications of IT and her survey research conducted under an existing NSF ITR grant and will directly influence the construction of tools that support the specification and compliance checking of policydriven IT systems. These tools in turn will integrate the framework and survey results with an industry standard privacy preferences platform, P3P, going beyond P3P to allow specification and monitoring of privacy RPOs at a semantic level that users and IT professionals share. The project team has a proven track record of successful research collaboration on requirements and policy analysis that bridges the two cultures identified. The proposed activity is creative in its foundational thinking and promises to produce currently unavailable technology and survey results. The project activities are distributed over the course of five years with proactive management by the PI with workshops scheduled to help track progress and invite external evaluation of project results. North Carolina State <br\/>University and Georgia Tech are well equipped and supported to conduct this work.","title":"ITR: Encoding Rights, Permissions and Obligations: Privacy Policy Specification and Compliance","awardID":"0325269","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2010-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["235460","517936"],"PO":["564388"]},"86533":{"abstract":"Proposal Number: 0325892\/0326006<br\/>Title: Secure and Robust IT Architectures to Improve Survivability of the Power Grid<br\/><br\/>Abstract:<br\/><br\/>The communications architecture for today's electric power grid is designed to support a centralized control model developed for the vertically integrated, regulated power monopolies, each with complete control of a geographic area. However, in recent years deregulation has introduced many more participants on the grid. Together with a push for some measure of decentralized control, this and a proliferation of intelligent digital devices on the grid have made the management of the grid increasingly dependent on internet technology and networked computers, exposing the grid to a new threat: cyber-attacks. At the same time, deregulation has resulted in economic pressures to operate the grid with less safety margin, increasing the potential damage caused by disturbances and the need for better control, and more rigorous analysis behind that control, more crucial. The grid's already overtaxed information technology (IT) infrastructure does not have the ability to deliver information with the required quality of service and flexibility to meet the ever-changing security requirements of the evolving grid. The IT infrastructure needs to be made highly adaptive to ensure its survivability. <br\/>Power researchers and engineers have detailed models of power dynamics on various geographic scales. However, none also incorporates other facets such as market factors, regulatory changes, and cyber-attacks that can affect the grid in different ways, and on different time scales. Because cyber-attacks target IT systems at their core, cyber-protection has to be an integral part of design. <br\/>One fundamental contribution of this project comes from incorporating cybersecurity features in the modeling and decision making tools for relating the complex interactions among the physical, information, economic, and regulatory signals within the evolving electric power grid. The research is organized around three thrusts of activity which are being pursued interactively: I. Hybrid models of grid information technology, power dynamics, cyber-attacks, policy and markets. II. Distributed agent systems for flexible and adaptive control of the grid and its survivability. III. Robust and secure status dissemination middleware for new grid information technology architectures<br\/>The electric power delivery system, the most critical of our critical infrastructures, is undergoing revolutionary changes. Successful completion of this research will contribute methodology, artifacts and knowledge to improve the security and efficiency of the power grid as it takes its new shape in coming years. This project sets the foundations of an ambitious collaborative research program between CMU and WSU, to address the complex issues associated with the modernization of the grid and its increasing reliance on an intelligent (i.e computerized) infrastructure.This collaborative research is structured as a long term interdisciplinary effort in which PhD students will acquire the kind of expertise this new phase of electricity generation and distribution calls for. In the short term, research tools are developed which can be used to compare different architectures for command and control of the grid and their survivability.","title":"Collaborative Research: ITR: Secure and Robust IT Architectures to Improve Survivability of the Power Grid","awardID":"0325892","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["257731",226250,226251,"563201","226621"],"PO":["561889"]},"86665":{"abstract":"Distributed real-time embedded computing applications have entered an explosive growth pattern in both, variety and production volume.

Further information about the project can be found on the web site (http:\/\/www-db.ics.uci.edu\/pages\/raccoon\/). The research results will have broad impacts in information management in e-commerce, scientific data management, digital government, and homeland security. The results will be disseminated in the form of publications, publicly available data sets, software, and demos.

Through collaborative efforts of computer scientists and architects, the work seeks to develop and use tools that allow the intuitive creation, manipulation, and display of data an images within a stereoscopic, high ambient intensity, multi-user, immersive projection environment, to achieve fundamental breakthroughs that facilitate the creative design process, and enhance the understanding of science behind the art of effective visual representation. At the same time, new algorithms for effective interactive rendering and manipulation of large scanned environmental datasets and new tools for physically and perceptually realistic color appearance rendering will be developed. The infrastructure contributes to the following research:<br\/> Harnessing the Fullest Potential of Virtual Environment Technology for Research in Visualization and Design,<br\/> Developing New Tools for Conceptual Architectural Design in Immersive Virtual Environments,<br\/> New Tools for Efficient Rendering and Design Conceptualization, and<br\/> Computer Aided Color Appearance Design.<br\/>The first project aims at determining how to most effectively harness the special potential of virtual environment displays for data representation. Foremost will be efforts to investigate methods for facilitating and exploiting the expanded spatial understanding afforded by immersive displays, exploring the impact of employing a range of non-photorealistic representational styles in immersive virtual environments. The second builds on an immediate-mode modeling system and software, supporting the geometry creation and manipulation, and texture, image and video insertion and manipulation. Goals include offering the designer a space that supports designing (not just an empty space in which to stand); investigating the kind of contextual environment that best supports the design in its various stages; different aspects with different scales; finest expression of ideas; support of the supply and generation of information, text, image, video, and sound within the design environment; support of symbols and representation within the virtual environment; and determining those aspects of the design that are best done outside the environment and the best way to bridge the two worlds. The third develops a tool to allow modeling geometry on top of the finished sketch design, much like the experience of working with tracing paper. The last uses the panoramic display system to evaluate the results of computer aided color appearance design (CACAD) research that was performed on either cathode ray tubes or other specialized CACAD workstations. At the fundamental computer graphics level, this work is expected to expand the state of the art in virtual reality by evaluating the contribution that surface reflection makes to the illusion of \"presence.\" The work explores whether expensive surface finish samples and controlled observing conditions can be replaced by computer graphics simulations and a \"virtual color proofing\" system. <br\/><br\/>The impact of the research will extend to new courses in CS and architecture.

This program of research measures various losses using a new research vehicle, the long-term organizational simulation. Participants engage in a task in which they simulate buying and selling things to each other in a competitive market for weeks at a time. In the course of buying and selling, they form impressions of each other, make long standing deals, favor some suppliers over others with speedy reactions and lower prices. Various theories predict how the losses will vary when the numbers of remote people and their locations vary, and how various interventions will help.

Such applications need to deal with sparse and very large data sets. Furthermore, such data is updated in append-only manner. In this proposal novel summarization and aggregation techniques are being developed for high-dimensional datasets which are sparse and are updated in append-only manner. These techniques are multi-resolution in nature, and exploit the efficiency with which disks can read sequentially stored information. Iceberg CUBES, which have proved to be particularly beneficial for sparse data cubes, are also being efficiently computed and materialized. Such sparse data cubes are represented using ranges, and approximations are derived by maintaining information regarding top-k and bottom-k elements. <br\/>Multidimensional data poses significant challenges not only in terms of storage and retrieval but analyzing such data becomes a fundamental problem. The focus of this research is on the issue of developing efficient representations for very high-dimensional data that are both sparse and dynamic. Efficient representations will enable fast analysis of high-dimensional data specially in the context of spatial and temporal data, high resolution images, and time sequences. The research is timely and is likely to have a profound impact on the development of efficient analysis tools for large high-dimensional datasets. The research results will contribute towards the design and development of next generation of on-line analytical processing tools sorely needed both in industrial as well as scientific communities. Currently, earth scientists often need to scale down earth-science computational models due to the complexity of spatial joins for large datasets. Similarly, datacubes for high dimensional datasets are avoided by analysts. The tools and algorithms produced will be a step towards alleviating many of these problems. The PIs frequently interact with members of the local high-tech industry to provide necessary guidance for solving problems related to the scalable management of high dimensional data. The research results will directly contribute to such efforts. The research will also serve as a vehicle for the advanced training of graduate students and the software developed will be used in both graduate and undergraduate education.","title":"Efficient Approaches to Summarize Sparse & Dynamic Datasets","awardID":"0223022","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7484","name":"IIS SPECIAL PROJECTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["536696","500153"],"PO":["563751"]},"86424":{"abstract":"Intelligence analysts must sift through massive amounts of information, using perspective gained from history and experience to pull together from disparate sources the best coherent picture of what is happening.

The hypothesis being explored is that these techniques can be combined synergistically, each overcoming limitations of the others. The team has access to detailed data about how analysts work and opportunities for feedback about prototypes through Cycorp's participation in ARDA\/NIMD's Glass Box Analysis Environment, which records the information streams analysts use while working on unclassified but representative problems.

However, most genes are far longer than the limits of accurate DNA synthesis. Thus, the rapid creation of tailored genes has not been convenient. As preliminary results we have developed a method for the computational optimization of DNA sequences that encode their own correct self-assembly. Scores of short overlapping synthetic oligonucleotides are designed to hybridize correctly with great efficiency at a high temperature, while all competing nonproductive hybridization events are identified and disfavored. Sequence properties are optimized using a formal heuristic search. Based on these preliminary results this project is developing novel methods in information technology and biotechnology for the self-assembly of long strings of mixed coding, regulatory, and intergenic regions. The DNA constructs that result may be hybridized into any plasmid expression vector and transformed into cells, or used directly as DNA templates to produce proteins in coupled in vitro transcription-translation systems. The new methods will be accurate, enzyme-free, in solution, single step, scalable, and high-throughput. They will have relevance to large-scale, high-throughput crystallization and proteomics efforts and enable the facile creation of synthetic genomes.","title":"ITR: Information Technology for Self-Assembling Synthetic Genes","awardID":"0326037","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":[226350,226351],"PO":["565136"]},"86446":{"abstract":"Constructing machines capable of learning from examples is a complex, cross-disciplinary problem that spans a wide spectrum of scientific endeavor.

In the<br\/>past, a major source of man-made interference was from automobile ignition. Now a major<br\/>source of man-made interference is from electronic devices, digital answering machines,<br\/>computers etc. Communication devices like cellular phones, and wireless computer networks are<br\/>relative new comers and are making efficient use of the spectrum using Code Division Multiple<br\/>Access (CDMA) with power control to maximize capacity with the minimum transmitter power.<br\/>These devices generate a spread spectrum which cannot be easily distinguished from Gaussian<br\/>noise without knowledge of the code to de-spread the signal. Another source of noise-like signals<br\/>comes from the new digital television transmitters. In order to avoid harmful interference and<br\/>minimize the elevation of the noise level in the environment, it is important to monitor the level<br\/>of this noise. The natural environmental noise for frequencies between 500 MHz and 20 GHz<br\/>consists mainly of about 300 K from the ground, 3K from the cosmic background, and about 5 to<br\/>30 K from the atmosphere. In the radio astronomy bands and other itreceive onlyle bands, it is<br\/>important to prevent any increase in the noise temperature while measurement of the noise<br\/>temperature in other bands can be useful information needed to optimize the efficient use of the<br\/>spectrum for various applications including radio astronomy and wireless communications.<br\/>MIT Haystack Observatory proposes to develop a monitor to measure the interference levels in<br\/>the frequency range 30 to 1500 MHz, calibrated to provide the output metric in units of degrees<br\/>Kelvin, and with sufficient sensitivity to be able to quantify, to a level of a few degrees Kelvin,<br\/>the unwanted noise in the protected receive-only bands like those for radio astronomy, remote<br\/>sensing, and deep space bands. This supports the joint initiative between the NSF and the FCC.<br\/>In phase 1, the proposers plan to study receiver and calibration designs needed to provide the sensitivity<br\/>and accuracy without significant internal inter-modulation, spurious responses and spurious<br\/>signals. In this phase they will also set specifications for the design based upon preliminary<br\/>measurements, using currently available equipment, of the RFI environment at the MIT Haystack<br\/>Observatory, in Westford, MA. In phase 2 we propose to prototype the interference temperature<br\/>monitor and test the design at Haystack. In phase 3 we propose to conduct tests of the system at a<br\/>few locations in the Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire area. In the future, depending<br\/>on the results, such a monitoring system could be replicated elsewhere to gather a data set to<br\/>characterize the RFI environment at other locations.<br\/>Broader Impact: Through this project, the proposers aim to enhance the awareness of the properties of<br\/>radio wave technology and its various applications such as radio astronomy and wireless<br\/>communications, as well as the radio frequency interference environment. Thus, a simple RFI<br\/>monitoring system will be developed for use in pre-college educational settings to acquaint<br\/>students and teachers with the measurement techniques of radio wave signals and the<br\/>environment around their schools and towns. Such data could be inter-compared using the<br\/>Internet, and Haystack Observatory will develop web-based educational materials to introduce the<br\/>study of radio waves and their various applications. In particular, the proposers will arrange for the<br\/>deployment of simple radio receivers and antennas, available commercially, to local area schools<br\/>around the Observatory to engage students in RFI measurements. A collaboration with students<br\/>and teachers in Australia, as part of the Australian SEARFE project will be promoted to enhance<br\/>international networking on this topic. A project with local area teachers as part of NSF's<br\/>program 'Research Experiences for Teachers (RET)' at Haystack Observatory is starting in<br\/>summer 2003 to initiate this activity.","title":"SP: Development of an Interference Temperature Monitor","awardID":"0338737","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["327061","551297"],"PO":["7594"]},"87249":{"abstract":"Networked Sensing, Decision, and Actuation<br\/><br\/>The interconnection of sensors, actuators, and controllers <br\/>enables local and remote supervision of physical environments.<br\/>A fundamental difference between the traditional and the networked control <br\/>problem is that the network introduces unreliable and time-dependent levels<br\/>of service (delays, jitter, losses).<br\/>In turn, network vagaries can jeopardize the stability, safety, and <br\/>performance of the controlled units.<br\/>The primary objective of this research is to devise integrated<br\/>control and communication algorithms to compensate for the<br\/>vagaries of network service.<br\/><br\/>Such control and communication strategies are targeted toward the<br\/>application-layer and their objective is to deal with<br\/>packet losses, delays, jitter, and network unreliability.<br\/>This objective necessitates an integrated approach that combines networking <br\/>(e.g., network measurement, modeling, and simulation; reliability) with <br\/>decisions based on sensor data (e.g., feedback control).<br\/>Although strategies have to be adapted to the specific application areas,<br\/>the research addresses a general methodology by drawing from the foundations<br\/>of Systems Theory and of Networking.<br\/>Control algorithms and communication protocols are evaluated according to a <br\/>methodology that combines analytical characterization, co-simulation, and <br\/>prototype construction and validation.<br\/><br\/>The broader impact of this research includes teaching, course <br\/>and curriculum development, graduate advising, and undergraduate research <br\/>experiences. <br\/>An objective of this work is to expand the presence of groups that are <br\/>under-represented in Engineering and Computer Science.<br\/>The investigators have on-going relationships with industry.<br\/>The results of this research are published and freely disseminated.","title":"SENSORS: Network Sensing, Decision, and Actuation","awardID":"0329910","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}}],"PIcoPI":["548925",228331],"PO":["561889"]},"78548":{"abstract":"Knowledge Domain Visualizations (KDVs) are a special kind of Information Visualizations (IVs) that exploit powerful human vision and spatial cognition to help humans mentally organize and electronically access and manage large, complex information spaces.

Continued advances in computing, communication, and storage technologies, combined with the development of national and global Grid systems, hold the promise of providing the required capacities and an effective environment for computing and science. A key challenge to overcome is that some of the current network control and resource sharing algorithms cannot scale to this regime. The goal of the Caltech FAST Project is to develop theories and algorithms for the future ultrascale networks, implement and demonstrate them in state-of-the-art testbeds, and deploy them in communities that have a clear and urgent need today. <br\/><br\/>A critical component of this effort is an experimental infrastructure on which to develop, test, and demonstrate new algorithms at both high speed and large delay. It is impossible to conduct this research on network simulators or in the high performance wide-area networks (WAN) available today.

For example, the fact that peer-to-peer systems do not need a central server means that individuals can cooperate without fees or an investment in additional high-performance hardware. Also, peer-to-peer systems enable the use of computations and storage resources that otherwise sit idle on individual computers. Furthermore, the decentralized and distributed nature of peer-to-peer systems makes them robust against accidental faults.<br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, the architecture of many current and proposed P2P systems assumes that the nodes can be trusted not to behave maliciously. While this may be possible to achieve with the help of a central certification authority, in many situations it is not desirable to constrain the membership of a P2P system. Consequently, the system must be able to withstand a variety of security attacks. Many of the existing systems are quite vulnerable security against very mild attacks that we call unlucky-input attacks. There is no need to do anything malicious to execute a major denial of service. Even if all processors follow the protocol to the letter, it is possible for the system to run into a situation with extremely poor connectivity (and therefore performance) or a memory overflow at some sites. Furthermore, if users leave the network at inopportune times, they may permanently remove data or disconnect some sites. Although these bad luck events may rarely happen, an adversary can significantly reduce the time required for such events without doing anything illegal such as altering the protocol or sniffing at communication between other peers. These anomalies exploit \"minor theoretical glitches\" in the existing approaches, and but they could serve as a platform for major DOS attacks.<br\/><br\/>The goal of this work is to develop a sound theoretical foundation for peer-to-peer systems that will allow fixing these problems in existing systems.","title":"Secure Peer-to-Peer Overlay Networks","awardID":"0311795","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2802","name":"TRUSTED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["343097",217432],"PO":["521752"]},"86414":{"abstract":"This project investigates the design, modeling, (re)configuration, and validation of trustworthy networked embedded systems (NES) applications that support the privacy of their users, the confidentiality and integrity of the data, the availability of the provided services, while implementing the required functionality and quality of service by developing the fundamental new science of secure network embedded systems and its implications for the emerging infrastructure.

Kumar<br\/>U of Southern California<br\/><br\/>The term fading is used to describe the unpredictable and often rapid fluctuation in received signal strength encountered in a wireless communication environment. Dropped calls in cellular communication are often attributable to fading. A very effective and recent technique used to combat fading is to use multiple antennas at both input (transmitter end) and output (receiver end). The term space-time communication channel is used to describe the fading, wireless communication channel in the presence of multiple input and output antennas. Multiple input and output can be used to either increase the reliability of a wireless communication channel or else increase the rate at which information can be transmitted by a factor potentially equal to the number of transmit antennas. When used to both increase reliability and rate of information transfer, there is a tradeoff between the increase in information rate and the corresponding reliability of the communication link. This tradeoff is referred to as the rate-diversity tradeoff. A principal goal in the present project is the design of signal sets that will allow the user to pick an operating point along the rate diversity tradeoff curve. Other goals include helping define and achieve the limits of the space-time communication channel.<br\/>More specific objectives include the design of signal sets that achieve the rate-diversity tradeoff and that are easy to decode, the study of alternative relevant notions of channel capacity such as delay-limited channel capacity, the study of other relevant channel models including those incorporating channel memory and correlated path gains, the study of the space-time channel in the presence of feedback as well as in the presence of sources having a multi-resolution capability.","title":"ITR Collaborative Research: Achieving the Rate Diversity Tradeoff in Space-Time Codes","awardID":"0326628","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["554954","562301"],"PO":["564898"]},"86304":{"abstract":"This project addresses homeland security, an issue of the highest national priority, with a goal of monitoring, preventing, and recovering from natural and inflicted disasters.

More information about the workshop can be found at http:\/\/www.caip.rutgers.edu\/ams2003\/. The proliferation of Internet technologies, services and devices, have made the current networked system designs, and management tools incapable of designing reliable, secure networked systems and services. In fact, we have reached a level of complexity, heterogeneity, and dynamism that our information infrastructure is becoming unmanageable and insecure. Furthermore, current design techniques and software tools that control and manage the information infrastructure are incapable of handling its complexity, heterogeneity, uncertainty, and security requirements. On the other hand, biological systems have developed successful strategies and techniques to handle these issues. The main goal of the Autonomic Computing Workshop is establish a world-class forum to investigate the research issues and enabling technologies toward the convergence of biological technological and information systems (called Autonomic Computing). Autonomic computing research will enable the design of the next generation of networked systems and services that are capable of managing and controlling themselves, and can anticipate their workloads and automatically adjust the configurations of their resources to meet the new loads. NSF sponsored the second through the fourth Active Middleware Services that were held in conjunction with the IEEE High Performance Distributed Computing Symposiums (HPDC-9 - HPDC-11). These three workshops were very successful, with invited and contributed research papers presented at each workshop. The proceedings of the Second AMS Workshop was published by Kluwer Academic Publishers in 2000 as a book entitled \"ACTIVE MIDDLEWARE SERVICES\" and edited by Salim Hariri, Craig A. Lee, and Cauligi S. Raghavendra. The Third and Fourth Annual AMS workshop proceedings were published by IEEE Computer Society. The success of the AMS workshops has motivated the organization of the present workshop which is the fifth workshop in this series . The fifth AMS workshop will focus on the research issues and challenges facing the development of autonomic computing systems that have the capabilities of being self-defining, self-configuring, self-healing, self-optimizing, self-anticipating, being contextually aware of their environments, are and open.","title":"NGS: Autnomic Computing Workshop (The Fifth Annual International Workshop on Active Middleware Services - AMS 2003)","awardID":"0332132","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2004-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"4080","name":"ADVANCED COMP RESEARCH PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2884","name":"NEXT GENERATION SOFTWARE PROGR"}}],"PIcoPI":["561892","558205"],"PO":["301532"]},"86447":{"abstract":"Spoken language is much more than simply audible text. The way we produce words and phrases tells our hearers much about our mental state and the intentions that underlie our words and actions. While machines have become increasingly proficient at recognizing sentences in current spoken dialog systems, they are still very poor at detecting, inter alia, whether speakers are frustrated or confident, or whether they are trying to deceive or to convey helpful information to their hearers. Despite promising work in identifying verbal and non-verbal cues to emotion and intention in acted, laboratory speech, and early results identifying limited types of emotion in more natural settings, we have only a limited understanding of reliable verbal cues (acoustic, prosodic, lexical and syntactic) to these phenomena and consequently do not know how to automatically recognize the phenomena automatically.<br\/><br\/>The PIs will first conduct a series of laboratory experiments to identify acoustic, prosodic, lexical and syntactic cues to emotion and intention in elicited (non-acted) speech. They will, in parallel, discover new features that may be useful in automatically identifying emotions and intentions such as deceptiveness, confidence, and frustration\/anger using available corpora with augmented labeling and labeling new corpora for these speaker states\/intentions. They will subsequently test these features on the laboratory recordings and identify new features that may be suggested by analysis of these recordings. The result should provide a better understanding of what auditory cues characterize certain speaker states\/intentions and which of these provide reliable features for their automatic identification.<br\/><br\/>From a practical point of view, identifying speaker state\/intentions automatically should be of considerable benefit for interactive voice response systems such as call center response systems, over the phone banking or travel reservation systems, or tutorial systems. Automatic identification of speaker state\/intentions should also provide useful information for speaker screening in a variety of applications that currently depend upon human assessment of speaker state\/intention.","title":"ITR: Recognizing and Understanding Emotion in Speech","awardID":"0325399","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"T044","name":"HOMELAND SECURITY-REC & UNDERS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"V380","name":"ARMY-INVESTIGAE EMOTION IN SPE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"V568","name":"HOMELAND SECURITY-INVEST EMOTI"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"V792","name":"HOMELAND SECURITY-EMOTION IN S"}}],"PIcoPI":["294416","517444",225933,"297874","511614","227711"],"PO":["565227"]},"88779":{"abstract":"This SGER project will investigate the socially optimal tradeoffs between open and closed software licensing.

The mechanism will embody a flexible Bayesian framework, admitting the inclusion of additional tracking guidance components as they are developed.

Unfortunately, even capturing only a byte of information per executed instruction generates on the order of a gigabyte of data per second on a modern high-end microprocessor. Hence, nontrivial traces need to be stored in compressed form to be manageable. While good compression schemes exist for traces that capture only the PCs of the executed instructions, these schemes can be ineffective on extended traces that include important additional information such as the content of registers, effective addresses, values on a bus, etc. We propose to employ techniques from the value-prediction literature to compress extended traces. Preliminary results show that our approach delivers substantially improved compression rates on the traces where it matters the most, i.e., on the traces that other algorithms cannot compress well. The extended information is important because it encapsulates the parameters that are of interest in many current research endeavors. <br\/><br\/>To enable the utilization of this kind of information in the classroom and the laboratory, high-performance compression tools need to be developed and made publicly available. This is the primary goal of this proposal.

It will be made available on the Web along with commented source code, documentation, and a tutorial.

Our research aims at utilizing a variety of tools from computer graphics to allow access to this data in a natural manner. Our specific interest is in developing novel methods for displaying how cultural artifacts change over time and space. Ultimately, we envision what amounts to a spatial\/temporal graphical browser for data related to the Earth.<br\/><br\/>A session with the hypothetical system<br\/>A user's browser displays the view from the University of Utah over Salt Lake City with the Great Salt Lake visible on the horizon. The images have the pen-and-ink and watercolor style of architectural \\presentation graphics\" with detail and texture indicated with just a few strokes, and most colors muted to make the lines prominent. This is the same style used in most manuals and textbooks. The user first moves across the rendered city in the air, looking down at the bustling people and traffic. A particular building catches the user's eye. The user clicks the mouse and a web browser brings up information known about the building, such as its being built in 1870. The user adjusts the time indicator back to 1870. Over the course of thirty seconds (based on the user's preference settings and heuristics) the adjacent buildings come and go, and a trolley system appears and disappears in front of the building. <br\/><br\/>The user is now in 1870 and has a much clearer view of the lake to the west. The user moves to the lake, and can see moving water and small amounts of human activity. The user now more aggressively moves backward in time to 9000 B.C. and watches the shores of the lake fluctuate widely as the water rises and falls. Now the user asks the system to \"flag\" areas where the database has high densities of unsynthesized data. A flag appears to the west of the lake. The user zooms to this and sees two caves. A click on the caves opens a browser window that indicates the caves are the oldest known inhabited sites in Utah, and were used over several thousand years by paleoindians. The user enters Danger Cave, and observes a group of paleoindians preparing food over a fire.<br\/><br\/> The user now turns selects \"uncertainty rendering\". Here objects in the database that are stored with a high confidence are rendered with clean lines and detailed textures. Objects stored with low confidence are drawn with sketchy lines and no color. For example, the petroglyphs near the mouth of the cave still exist and thus have high confidence. Petroglyphs in the back of the cave, if they existed, have been destroyed by rock fall and erosion. They have been created speculatively by the archeologist based on other sites, and are thus drawn with low confidence. Note that the system merely accesses archaeologic data. More sophisticated archaeologic uses would be done by other programs, just as the current Web is not used for general data manipulation. The user now exits the cave and asks for the nearest significant events in the past and future near the cave. In the future is shown the arrival of agriculture in the area around 200 A.D. In the past is shown the draining of Lake Bonneville around 10,000 B. C. Here the ancestor of the Great Salt Lake, spanning most of the state of Utah and having an average depth of hundreds of feet, lost most of its water volume through a collapsed narrow pass into the Snake River. The user selects the beginning of the past event and can see the shores of the giant lake, and a variety of wildlife including mammoths and giant land sloths. Still in uncertainty mode, there are also a few sketchily drawn humans; it is debated whether paleoindians were present in Utah that early in time. A visual flag indicates an interesting feature to the North. The user can go witness the site of the landslide.<br\/>By selecting the end of the flood, the user over thirty seconds can watch the inland sea drain, and the shorelines vastly contract. Finally, the user can zoom back to the present day to see the current cultural features and distant lake.","title":"ITR: Graphical Navigation of the Earth in Space and Time","awardID":"0312479","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4080","name":"ADVANCED COMP RESEARCH PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["560997","292838"],"PO":["565272"]},"83313":{"abstract":"Graph partitioning is a fundamental combinatorial optimization<br\/>problem that has many practical applications such as<br\/>in supporting efficient load balancing for parallel processing,<br\/>in VLSI layout, and in data clustering.

This project focuses on humanoid robots, which are becoming increasingly useful as they advance in sophistication, because they can perform in environments engineered specifically for humans, and because they make it easier for humans to interact with automation. This project focuses specifically on how to program humanoid robots; i.e. how to program their movements and interactions as easily and as effectively as possible. The focus is not on developing new algorithms for robot movement or sensing. Rather, once an algorithm is in hand, how does one program a robot to walk, wave its arms, clap its hands, or pick up an object? How does one do so in a high-level way that is devoid of unnecessary detail, yet is expressive enough to capture all desirable movements and interactions?<br\/><br\/>The core of this effort is the design of a domain-specific language called \"Dance\" that is highly abstract, easy to use, yet has enough expressive power to describe a wide range of useful robot movements. Dance incorporates ideas from the PI's previous work on domain-specific languages for computer music, computer animation, and software-enabled control. For example, Dance uses declarative event-based reactivity to give a robot the ability to respond to its environment (through tactile, aural, and visual sensors), to its own body (such as interactions between limbs), and to internal programmatic events (timers, remote messages, user commands, and so on). Innovative language research makes behaviors the objects of computation in Dance, which enables programs to abstract over (aggregate) action sequences and evaluate interactions of such sequences. The language is also amenable to formal reasoning based on a formal algebraic semantics. It is possible to prove crucial run-time properties of Dance programs based on the axioms of this algebra. The proposed work also includes a programming environment called \"Dance Studio\" that has the ability to simulate and thus visualize a running Dance program, enabling a programmer to dynamically debug her programs prior to full robot deployment.<br\/><br\/>Dance language research pioneers a control programming concept that is relevant for many applications in which complex, aggregate system behaviors or maneuvers are required, and in which such behaviors must be coordinated and assured. The research is part of, and supports, a broader agenda at Yale to create \"socially adept\" robots. Building a machine that can recognize social cues from a human observer allows a more natural human-machine interaction style, creates possibilities for machines to learn by directly observing untrained human instructors, and expands on the growing capabilities of robotic systems. Such social machines can be used as investigative tools to study many aspects of human social development. For example, a robot that is capable of perceptually identifying social cues can be used to provide a quantitative metric of social response. This metric may be a useful diagnostic tool for social development disorders such as autism. In fact research on the use of humanoid robots to diagnose and treat autism is being conducted in the broader scope of Yale's humanoid robotics program.","title":"ITR: Dance, a Programming Language for the Control of Humanoid Robots","awardID":"0325690","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["541889","541946","497125",226134],"PO":["561889"]},"86635":{"abstract":"Since the Morris worm hit the Internet, the evolution of viruses and worms has kept anti-virus analysts busy developing new scanning and detection capabilities. New viruses continue to outsmart current technologies and wreak havoc. It is clear that existing strategies do not suffice but rather only contribute to the ongoing arms race between virus writers and the anti-virus industry. This proposal addresses the question: \"What is the next big break, the next revolution in anti-virus technology?\"<br\/><br\/>The PIs propose a joint effort between CMU, Symantec and CERT to research global defense mechanisms and deployment strategies. Instead of approaching the problem from the perspective of individual nodes, this research will take on a network-wide point of view. In addition to the immediate impact, the problem presents research challenges that are extremely appealing to theorists and practitioners alike.<br\/><br\/>The preliminary study suggests that there appears to be an analogy between the principles of self-organized criticality and virus propagation-once the dynamic state of propagation crosses a critical level of distribution, the virus flourishes and attains eventual prevalence. This is in contrast to the traditional epidemic threshold that is characterized using only static birth and death rate of the virus. Understanding this critical level of distribution is an interesting problem, and it is likely to point to new methods to thwart the spread of computer viruses. Studying the analogy between mathematical models such as dynamic-state models and virus propagation is a central theme of this proposal. The PIs propose three major thrusts in this work. <br\/><br\/>1) Determine the topology underlying modern viruses and worms. It has been suggested that virus propagation obeys a power-law structure much like the physical Internet topology. However, there is no reason to believe that viral propagations would mirror the physical topology of the network. Rather, evidence suggests that they follow some sort of a social network, or a random network in the case of some worms. Our work will be the first to develop a definitive model of virus propagation topology using real attack data and user data.<br\/><br\/>2) Develop a new model that captures propagation behavior on the virtual topology. Specifically, the PIs are interested in modeling a) topology-aware propagation behavior, b) the effect of environmental factors, and c) the dynamics between infections (dissipation) and defenses (feedback force).<br\/><br\/>3) Use the mathematical models to develop and reason about network-centric defense strategies.<br\/><br\/>The PI team is part of the Center for Computer and Communications Security (C3S) at CMU. One of the center's goals is to promote security education. We are in the process of engineering a new degree program-Master in Information Security. We expect this collaborative research effort to stimulate student interests and foster further research in information security. Symantec will be an industry partner throughout this effort. Specifically, they will supply us with their proprietary database containing an extensive dataset with respect to virus incidents. In addition, two of the PIs hold joint appointments with CERT (part of the Software Engineering Institute, an FFRDC operated by CMU) and have access to a large and growing body of data associated with real virus episodes.","title":"ITR: Defending Against Virus Propagation on the Internet","awardID":"0326472","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2011-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["553884","563508",226619,"548369",226621,"311936"],"PO":["565090"]},"83368":{"abstract":"Collaborative Research: Application Specific Architecture<br\/>Customization and Co-Exploration<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>The embedded market demands processors that can achieve high levels of performance in the smallest possible area, while simultaneously minimizing power and energy dissipation.

Over 65 undergraduate students in different ethnic groups, majoring in computer science or computer engineering, in 4 minority-serving institutions were interviewed. Preliminary findings confirmed for women and minorities in science and engineering and IT issues such as: (i) the digital divide, (ii) a confidence gap in mathematics and IT; (iii) subtle biases in early socialization; (iv) the masculine environment; and (v) lack of role models and mentoring. Preliminary findings also revealed that: (i) students' perception of IT as white and male-oriented was outweighed by job opportunities in IT; (ii) students who switched from CS and CE, remained within IT-related areas, because they offered better job prospects and economic gains; (iii) students experienced technical difficulties because of lack of experience with debugging skills and inadequate problem solving skills; (iv) students had poor time management skills especially when they did not have their family's financial support for education and thus had to work part-time to support their studies. <br\/><br\/>The full study will have approximately 170 participants and will take place in 5 additional Minority Serving Institutions. By including the examination of ethnicity as well as gender as a factor, the full study aims both at deepening understanding of women's choices and at extending understanding of these choices as expressed in the literature. Cross-gender and cross-cultural comparison will provide a better understanding of the issues related to the lack of participation by women in IT disciplines and careers, and will shed light on the possible differential contribution of ethnicity to gender based choices.","title":"ITWF: Cross Ethnic Differences in Undergraduate Women's Preference for Information Technology","awardID":"0305898","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1713","name":"WORKFORCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["531861","522701"],"PO":["564181"]},"91574":{"abstract":"This goal of this effort is to develop the next general of firewalls by using filtering rules and some intrusion detection techniques.

To fully utilize the potential of such<br\/>networks, advances will be required on a number of fronts and through all layers of the network. However, in addition to dealing with most of the difficult issues of wireless communication networks, sensor networks give rise to a number of additional<br\/>issues as well.<br\/><br\/>Sensor networks must do a great deal more than just support communication. Transporting bits does not automatically lead to intelligent decision-making, and connectivity does not automatically result in coordination. In a sensor network there is a joint purpose to be accomplished by the entire network as a whole. There are fundamental questions about which bits to transmit, where to send them, and how to utilize them. Moreover, there are issues of whether to do computations locally, or to pass information to higher layers and perform partially centralized computations. These tasks must be accomplished in the face of scarce resources, notably limited time, bandwidth, and power.<br\/><br\/>One key area where breakthroughs are needed, and which is the focus of this project, concerns how to learn, adapt, and make decisions to carry out the goals of the sensor network in a complex and distributed environment. Accomplishing a joint<br\/>goal for the entire network poses significant information processing challenges. Myopic or local information gathered by the individual sensors must be fused for global<br\/>decision-making. These tasks are complicated by the large number of sensors, each of which may be heterogeneous, multimodal, possibly dynamic, and uncalibrated. In some applications the scene-sensor geometry may be unknown or only partially known, and<br\/>the environment itself will typically be complex and dynamic. <br\/><br\/>The key element that distinguishes learning, adaptation, and decision-making in sensor networks with most previous work in these areas is the distributed and local nature of the information gathering together with the rich and varied structure in the information and decisions to be made in the face of limited resources. A degenerate appeal to existing methods by sending all the data to a centralized node may be impossible or infeasible in many situations, and certainly will not be the most effective way to utilize limited resources. In this project, we address key problems in distributed learning in sensor networks, to begin to develop an understanding of the fundamental capabilities and limitations of learning and decision-making in sensor networks.","title":"ITR: Distributed Learning in Sensor Networks","awardID":"0312413","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":[217758],"PO":["562984"]},"83644":{"abstract":"Pricing has been extensively studied as a tool to relieve congestion in the Internet.

The text will make available the first known European treatise on naval architecture, and provide the first detailed historical discussion of Venetian ship design techniques in the English language. The edition will provide new texts in the history of navigation, contributing to the debate over the development and use of sea charts, and it will contribute to the growing debate over the role of astrology among non-elites in early modern Europe.

Initially, this project will focus on building a complete, unbiased model for the C2H2 zinc finger protein family. The C2H2 domain is common to many eukaryotic transcription factors. In order to develop the model, data will be collected through this project. Furthermore, computational tools will be developed to analyze the published genomes of yeast, worm, fly and human, in order to identify potential target genes of the members of the C2H2 family. A number of yeast predictions will be analyzed further with biochemical methods in order to assess the success of the method. Finally, the potential of this method as a general modeling method will be explored further, by attempting to model other protein families. Successful calculation and comparison of models for other protein families has the potential to reveal interfamily similarities and differences. An insight on the general rules that govern the protein-DNA recognition can be gained this way.","title":"Quantitative Modeling of Protein-DNA Binding Specificity","awardID":"0316255","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0703","name":"Division of CIVIL, MECHANICAL, & MANUFACT","abbr":"CMMI"},"pgm":{"id":"1266","name":"APPLIED MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0807","name":"Division of MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIE","abbr":"MCB"},"pgm":{"id":"1112","name":"Genetic Mechanisms"}}],"PIcoPI":["454963"],"PO":["324446"]},"85976":{"abstract":"This project, building a shared computational infrastructure to conduct experimental research in the areas of simulation analysis of large scale complex systems, boosts research in a variety of fields, including bioinformatics, social network analysis, geometrical and combinatorial algorithms, parallel and distributed computation, and the theory of computation. The infrastructure, consisting of a powerful high speed cluster (for intensive and distributed computation) and 64bit machines (for memory intensive computation), services the following projects:<br\/> Learning for Algorithm Design in Complex Systems,<br\/> Geometric and Combinatorial Computations on Large Random Objects, <br\/> Parallel and Distributed Algorithms, and<br\/> Exploring the Limits of Computation.<br\/>The first project develops a general learning paradigm for designing efficient algorithms to solve large-scale optimization problems. For the many complex systems where the relevant task leads to combinatorial problems that are computationally intractable, an alternative to find a solution is to learn an algorithm which is efficient for a specific problem of domain interest (in bioinfomatics, DNA assembly and alignment and protein folding, and in social networks, reverse engineering laws observed in society's communication). The second computes geometric properties of a large number of objects such as union of a large number of polygons. Techniques are applicable to VLSI, computational cartography, environmental planning, radio communication of the Moon and Mars as well as on earth, national defense, etc. Using experiments, new algorithms are developed by learning where to search in the combinatorial search space, for finding the maximum number of cliques in a graph (a classical NP-hard optimization problem with applications in cryptography and the study of protein networks with implications in physiology). The third develops and tests algorithms for the parallel simulation of large networks, and for distributed computing on large data sets. Loosely coordinated distributed network simulation and scientific computing on reconfigurable dynamic clusters are used respectively to achieve real-time simulation of large networks at the packet level and to develop a scalable computing system built from autonomous agents. The last, related to issues of computability and solvability, computes the Busy Beaver function, a heuristically productive n-state Turing machine.<br\/><br\/>The infrastructure also impacts education. Rather than the usual small artificial course projects, students will now be able to attack large practical problems. Moreover, the general algorithms will be made public to a wide audience for a wide range of applications.","title":"Simulation and Analysis of Large Scale Complex Systems","awardID":"0323324","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2890","name":"CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES"}}],"PIcoPI":["430756","385994","443288","320859","489824"],"PO":["557609"]},"83556":{"abstract":"Mueller<br\/>Whalley<br\/>Healy <br\/><br\/>Embedded systems with temporal constraints rely on timely scheduling<br\/>and a priori knowledge of worst-case execution times.

In medical imaging for example, a fundamental advance in shape matching will have important ramifications for the automated segmentation and classification of anatomical structures. In object recognition, advances in shape matching will be enormously useful in constructing new distance measures that can be used for indexing and retrieval.<br\/><br\/>Shape matching involves establishing correspondences between homologous structures in different objects. While the correspondence problem can be avoided if intensity-based approaches are used, these methods often rely on the brightness constancy assumption that is often invalid. Feature-based approaches to shape matching have to solve the correspondence problem in situations where there are significant global and local shape differences between the objects being compared. In non-rigid registration, a shape matching approach is required to objects into register. In this work, a relational shape matching approach for simultaneously solving for correspondence and non-rigid deformations is proposed. In contrast to most previous work, the shape matching objective function is set up as a pairwise correspondence and deformation problem. The template consists of a point-set and a known topology that can easily accommodate curves and surfaces. In sharp contrast to previous graph matching approaches, the data is represented as an unstructured point-set. While the resulting optimization problem may appear formidable, efficient algorithms can be designed based on recent and fundamental advances in Bayesian networks. The Bayesian network approach recasts the pairwise correspondence as a joint probability and this results in an alternating algorithm that iteratively updates joint probabilities and deformations. Assuming that efficient algorithms can be designed based on this approach, both non-rigid registration and object recognition applications can be tackled using the same framework and algorithm. Validation and evaluation of these algorithms will be done using medical imaging datasets. Comparisons will also be undertaken against our own previous NSF-funded non-rigid point matching (TPS-RPM) algorithms.<br\/><br\/>Despite mostly being confined to computer vision, shape matching has the potential to reach a much broader audience with computer graphics and theoretical physics being two concrete examples. In computer graphics, there is burgeoning interest in matching point clouds and more structured representations such as surfaces. While theoretical physics seems like an unlikely candidate at first glance, there is a deep connection between the shape matching objective functions proposed here and by many other vision researchers and general relativity; evidence of this connection can be seen in the recent work of Julian Barbour,<br\/>The End of Time, Oxford Univ. Press, 2000 (Chapter 11). These connections are just beginning to be noticed and come as a surprise to both vision and theoretical physics researchers. As shape matching in computer vision continues to make incremental (and hopefully inexorable) progress in both frameworks and efficient algorithms, it is hoped that these deep connections will result in unexpected and productive cross-fertilizations.","title":"Relational Shape Matching for Registration and Recognition","awardID":"0307712","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7339","name":"COMPUTER VISION"}}],"PIcoPI":["499432"],"PO":["317663"]},"83688":{"abstract":"ITR: Information Flow in a Heterogeneous Distributed System: Biomimetic Approaches to Embedded Coordinated Control<br\/><br\/>Proposal number: NSF-0313250<br\/><br\/>PI: Kristi A.

Specifically these tools will be used to address embedded, emergent coordinated behavior of multiple underwater robots using biological systems (fish schools) as models.

The methods to be used in this work fundamentally integrate techniques and tools from both biology and engineering, and the results have the potential for high impact in a broad range of applications. The particular applications that will be addressed in this project are emergent behaviors in mixed species schools of fish and coordinated control of autonomous underwater vehicles propelled in the carangiform style of locomotion.

This research develops models, metrics and algorithms as well as validates the results with real traces and scenarios to achieve the reliable IBGP (Internal BGP) reflection topology design, network availability assessment, and routing survivability. Router and link failures, errors in human maintenance, and changes in resource availability lead to reliability variations on different routers, links and IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) paths. Furthermore, IBGP is organized currently using clusters and route reflection topology, where different reflector and clients configurations have different reliability in IBGP operation. It is therefore important to deploy IBGP sessions on IGP paths that are more reliable, as well as place reflectors on reliable routers to avoid reflector failures and client isolations. In terms of network availability it is of crucial importance to address and manage resource availability as dynamic information, as well as to develop a QoS representation that can handle heterogeneity in global Internet routing.

For ad-hoc networks with frequent topology changes, such overhead may become a significant limit on the scalability and effective capacity. This research proposes to treat a variable topology network as a physical system that exhibits random (topology) changes. The minimum routing overhead is related to the minimum amount of information needed to identify the current state of the system (i.e. the current network topology). The distribution of topology changes is derived from the probability distributions describing the individual node mobility. Thus, the routing overhead can be related to the entropy rate of the system. Further, it is differentiated between different types of routing protocols based on the subset of changes that are relevant to the specific class of protocols under study. For example, proactive protocols keep track of any topology change, while reactive protocols track only the subset of the topology changes that affect nodes\/links actively participating in routing packets. In contrast to the previous work in the ad-hoc networks routing area, this work develops a new analytic, rather than simulative, study of routing overhead in variable topology networks and, a general treatment that provides reference curves against which the routing overhead of different competing protocols can be compared. The key new approach is the concept of information theoretic characterization of network topology variation.","title":"NR: Routing Overhead In Variable Topology Networks - A Theoretical Framework With Practical Implications","awardID":"0322956","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["434241"],"PO":["565090"]},"86504":{"abstract":"This multi-site research effort is aimed at developing a coherent, consistent, standardized Interlingual representation along with a methodology and sharable tools for annotating large bilingual corpora of parallel texts.

These bats provide an agricultural pest control service little understood by the scientific community and policy makers. The proposed effort will evaluate the nationwide ecological and economic impact of this species on both natural and agricultural ecosystems. The project is innovative in its development of information technology and unique in its complexity and scale. It requires the collaborative efforts of computer scientists, applied mathematicians, meteorologists, ecologists, and ecological economists. Proposed activities involve:<br\/>1. Sensing Technologies.-Design, develop, deploy, and evaluate algorithms and systems for thermal, ultrasonic, and radar sensing of millions of bats and insect pests. Such algorithms and systems currently do not exist but are crucial for providing a reliable census of the nationwide free-tailed bat populations and processes. Computer vision techniques will be developed to analyze nightly emergence, flight paths, and foraging behaviors of individuals and groups of bats.<br\/>2. Computational Modeling.-Design, develop, solve, and validate computational models of the agricultural-insects-bats system across temporal and spatial scales. Processes at lower levels of organization, such as the individual bat and its physiological functions, will be analyzed to solve problems posed at higher ecological levels of organization from the population to the landscape. Local population models for particular caves or bridges will be generalized to a spatially explicit regional model for Texas, and then to a spatially explicit landscape model that describes the nationwide impact of Brazilian free-tailed bats on agricultural ecosystems. Currently, no complete individual or population life-history models exist for free-tailed bats nor, indeed, for any bat species, in spite of the fact bats are ubiquitous throughout the world and are distinguished as the second largest order of mammals.<br\/>3. System Integration.-The proposed models will be integrated using both conceptual and spatial hierarchies. Results provided by the sensing technologies will be combined to represent the processes of foraging and migration. The integration of these outcomes as well as molecular tools (such as fecal DNA), entomological and agricultural information, energetics, meteorological and toxicological databases, will provide input parameters and validation data to computational models of bat populations. The models will integrate the interdependencies of dietary factors, energy consumption and allocation, weather patterns, effects of toxicants, etc. on birth and mortality rates and population sizes of bats and their prey.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts Resulting from the Proposed Activity<br\/>The importance of natural pest-control services becomes evident often only when they are degraded or eliminated by human activity. The proposed research will provide realistic estimates of the economic impact of Brazilian free-tailed bats. The proposed techniques may generalize to other species and thus have a broad impact in the fields of biology, ecology, ecological economics, and agriculture. The proposed methods of image analysis may apply to other large-scale video tracking applications, for instance, the analysis of group behavior of other bat species, insects, herding mammals (e.g., seals, caribou), colonial seabirds, the analysis of human crowd behavior, data mining of video of human motion, and video surveillance for homeland security. An important impact of the proposed research on society will be the development appropriate policy responses by federal, state, or local authorities based on the fundamentally improved understanding of the underlying biological and economic principles of natural pest control. The proposed effort addresses the goals of the ITR Program in a number of ways. It is multidisciplinary in nature, providing a new bridge between the fields of computational sciences and ecology. This may lead to novel, unanticipated insights and technologies in both fields. The proposed effort will train students in biology and computer science to fully integrate information technology and science. Graduate and undergraduate students from both disciplines will learn to conduct joint field experiments, analyze data, and work with computational models. The projects in computer science that are inspired by questions in biology promise to have a special appeal to women, and we expect that our project will encourage more women to explore the computational aspects of biology.","title":"ITR: Advanced Imaging and Information Technology for Assessing the Ecological and Economic Impact of Brazilian Free-Tailed Bats on Agroecosystems","awardID":"0326483","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1629","name":"BE: NON-ANNOUNCEMENT RESEARCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["556284","514728","557296",226627,226628],"PO":["565136"]},"86405":{"abstract":"This project proposes to extend the methods we have developed for model reduction of large-scale Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems to a new regime of problems that require adaptive models.

The tools developed in this project will be accessible via the project Web site (http:\/\/www.umiacs.umd.edu\/research\/CLIP\/BFEnt02\/), and can be applied by biologists to support ongoing scientific investigations in cancer research and diabetes, resulting in a broad impact in medical research and treatment. The educational impact includes a course on data management solutions for bioinformatics researchers and a workshop on experiment planning using data sources for biologists.","title":"Collaborative Research: Semantic Map of Biological Data Sources: Entity Identity and Path Characterization","awardID":"0223042","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0801","name":"Division of ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY","abbr":"DEB"},"pgm":{"id":"7298","name":"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["427973"],"PO":["563727"]},"86427":{"abstract":"The KEDS project is developing a toolkit for scientific discovery, which refers to the identification of new predictive models for a set of phenomena of interest from observational data about those phenomena.

Heuristic search methods are widely used in artificial intelligence. They find shortest paths for graph search problems much faster than uninformed search methods. Incremental search methods, on the other hand, are almost unknown in artificial intelligence. They find shortest paths for series of similar graph search problems much faster than is possible by solving each graph search problem from scratch. Incremental heuristic search methods have four advantageous properties:<br\/><br\/>1. Incremental heuristic search techniques speed up replanning substantially since they combine two different principles for speeding up the search. They can speed up replanning by one to two orders of magnitude compared to replanning from scratch. This is important because replanning problems are often time critical and have large state spaces.<br\/><br\/>2. The quality of the plans that result from replanning with incremental heuristic search techniques is as good as the quality of the plans that result from planning from scratch. This property is an important difference to many conventional replanning methods (such as case-based planning, planning by analogy, plan adaptation, transformational planning, planning by solution replay, and repair-based planning) that usually cannot make guarantees about the resulting plan quality.<br\/><br\/>3. Incremental heuristic search techniques are very versatile and apply, for example, to symbolic planning problems, path-planning problems, reinforcement-learning problems, and control problems.<br\/><br\/>4.

Their simplicity allows one to prove a number of properties about them, including their termination, correctness, efficiency, and similarity to A*, which makes them easy to understand, easy to analyze, easy to program, easy to optimize for efficiency, and easy to extend.

It happens when only such data is stored in the system and no direct<br\/>access to the real data is provided or is available.<br\/><br\/>Traditionally, complexity theory deals with the classical definition of<br\/>the explicitly given input data: the input is given explicitly and the<br\/>generally accepted standard is to search for algorithms having the<br\/>complexity linear, or at least polynomial in terms of the input size. Such<br\/>algorithms are viewed usually as the most efficient. However, this<br\/>significantly changes if we deal with massive data. It is sometimes<br\/>necessary to find good algorithms which deal with implicitly given data<br\/>and access only small part of the data (e.g., a random sample), or small<br\/>compressed or encoded representation of the data. The information which we<br\/>have about the data is now of size which would be substantially much<br\/>smaller than the size of the whole original input. In the extreme<br\/>situations it can be even constant (small sample sufficiently well<br\/>approximating, with high probability, the exact output).<br\/><br\/>The main theme of this research is to understand the relation between the<br\/>complexity of the problems in the classical model (where the access to<br\/>data is given explicitly) and the problems in the model in which the<br\/>access to the input is implicit.

In fact, identity fraud in welfare disbursement, credit card transactions, cellular phone calls, and ATM withdrawals totals several billion dollars each year. Recent concerns about homeland security have created additional interest in methods for personal identification. Personal identification is the process of associating a particular individual with an identity. Knowledge-based (e.g., password or PIN) and token-based (e.g., ID card or key) automatic personal identification approaches have been the two traditional techniques widely used. Since these approaches are not based on any inherent attributes of an individual, they suffer from the obvious disadvantages; tokens may be lost, stolen, or misplaced, and a PIN may be forgotten by a valid user or guessed by an impostor. As a result, these approaches are unable to differentiate between an authorized person and an impostor who fraudulently acquires the token or knowledge of the authorized person.<br\/><br\/>Biometric identification refers to identifying an individual based on his distinguishing physiological and\/or behavioral characteristics. Among the various such characteristics (e.g., face, voice, iris, fingerprints), fingerprints have been the most popular. Recent advances in fingerprint sensing technology allow these inexpensive sensors to be embedded in a variety of systems (e.g., laptops and PDAs). In spite of the deployment of large number of automatic fingerprint matching systems over the past 40 years, their performance is not perfect. The objectives of the proposed research are to (i) reliably extract fingerprint features (minutiae points), and (ii) develop robust fingerprint matching techniques based on these features even in the presence of noisy and distorted fingerprint images. We propose to use a number of statistical models both for feature extraction and matching. Proposed research will lead to more secure and robust fingerprint matching systems.","title":"ITR: Fingerprint Feature Extraction and Matching","awardID":"0312646","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"9199","name":"UNDISTRIBUTED PANEL\/IPA FUNDS"}}],"PIcoPI":["334363","480842"],"PO":["562984"]},"85526":{"abstract":"This project, enabling next generation research projects in automatic sensing and modeling, aims at acquiring a massive image capture and processing facility.

Thus a \"reference\" image\/video is assumed available, and loss of quality is measured as deviation from the reference. However, it is desirable to dispense with the reference video for practical applications, such as video-on-demand, streaming web video, video services to wireless units, and digital television. Thus No-Reference (NR) quality assessment (QA) is important. However, little progress has been made on NR QA since the models used have been simplistic and largely limited to applications involving block-based compressed visual data. However, successful algorithms for correctly predicting the quality of signals that have been distorted with other types of artifacts, such as ringing and blurring resulting from JPEG2000 image compression, remain nonexistent.<br\/>We are working on a new approach that makes use of the fact that natural scenes belong to a small set in the space of all possible image\/video signals. We are developing and adapting innovative statistical models that describe natural scenes. We have shown that distortions in image\/video processing systems are unnatural in terms of such statistics. Thus we are applying Natural Scene Statistics (NSS) models for the NR QA of visual signals that are assumed to derive from the sub-space of natural scenes. We have already shown that NSS model are effective for NR QA of still images compressed by wavelet-based methods (e.g., JPEG2000). We are developing new NSS models for both wavelet-based video compression and for modeling distortions in wireless video streams from channel burst errors and fast-fading channels.","title":"Blind Image and Video Quality Assessment Using Natural Scene Statistics","awardID":"0310973","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["485855"],"PO":["564898"]},"86505":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>0325701<br\/>Eric D.

To characterize baseline vs. anomalous behavior of the Internet requires deployment of collaborative data collection, anomaly detection and pattern recognition for complex largescale systems. The project combines the forces of leading researchers in three complementary disciplines: (i) networking and data collection; (ii) statistical data analysis and signal processing; (iii) decentralized decision-making. The research goes well beyond the state-of-the art anomaly detection for centrally administered networks. In particular tools and practical data sharing algorithms are being developed for detecting coordinated intrusions, distributed denial of service attacks, and quality-of-service degradations in decentralized networks such as the Internet. The project also includes activities with broader impact including: creation of a public network anomaly database, K-12 educational outreach, and university-industry collaborations.<br\/>The research approach is based on a modular and distributed monitoring paradigm that is organized into a three level hierarchy: local level measurement of data from servers, routers and switches; intermediate level data analysis and processing of end-to-end traffic measurements, summary statistics and alarms transmitted from the local level; and upper level decision-making and processing of information transmitted from the intermediate level. This modular structure is scalable to large networks of monitoring sites. However, this structure also imposes constraints on data analysis, which requires development of new approaches. Three approaches are being pursued: distributed spatio-temporal data analysis using wavelets over graphs; event detection and classification using distributed pattern analysis and learning; and multi-site event correlation using discrete event dynamical systems and decentralized stochastic systems.","title":"Collaborative Research: Modular Strategies For Global Internetwork Monitoring","awardID":"0325701","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["486062","564449"],"PO":["564898"]},"86516":{"abstract":"The fundamental premise of the research is that P2P networking will revolutionize the Internet and computing over the next ten years.

This problem manifests itself in many settings, including software management, configuration management and web-page evolution. The problem is particularly important as information systems are being designed (or re-designed) with a web-centered (typically XML-based) focus. The objective of this project is to extend database technology to better support the design and development of information systems that gracefully adapt to changes. Therefore, database systems must be extended with the ability to (i) manage and query efficiently temporal\/historical information, (ii) support version control for data sets and software artifacts, and (iii) unify management of data and metadata and reduce the problem of configuration management to that of temporal querying and version retrieval. The approach proposed to this challenging problem exploits XML ability to unify data and metadata and support powerful query languages. The evolution of information systems -- their data, metadata, and software artifacts -- is thus unified and modeled by time-stamped XML documents. The project will test the newly defined capabilities to be tested in a pilot study, where an existing information system for resume management and job placement are re-designed for evolution. Experiments based on past and planned changes, are used to validate the effectiveness of the solutions developed in the project.

Included in the project activities are the creation of a \"cyber-security house\", an applied cyber-security course, and a cyber-security repository for broad dissemination of the materials and results from the project. While national security is critically dependent on a continuous and correct functioning of modern computing systems, current, state-of-the-art computing systems typically do not meet the stringent requirements of security, availability, fault-tolerance, and high performance. The 2001 Computer Crime and Security Survey from CSI\/FBI describes two disturbing characteristics:(1) The number of computer crimes and security breaches are increasing, and (2) The total financial loss due to computer crimes and security breaches is increasing. One possible reason for this weakness of modern computing systems is that there is a severe shortage of skilled security professionals, resulting in a large number of computing systems being constructed by people who do not have adequate understanding of basic security principles. A fundamental reason for the shortage of security practitioners is that the principles and practices of security are typically not well covered in undergraduate education and only a handful of undergraduate programs in the USA even offer a course on computer security. The PI hypothesizes that fundamentally new mechanisms, which go beyond traditional classroom settings, are needed to address the current weaknesses associated with cyber-security technology and education. The overall goal of the project is to prepare a work force that is aware of system vulnerabilities, as well as a cadre of professionals that are knowledgeable about the recognized, best, and latest principles and practices available in security and information assurance. This project focuses on six activities: 1. Development of a \"cyber-security house\" to permit undergraduate students to learn and experiment with security principles and practices throughout their undergraduate career. This is intended to provide students an opportunity to learn and experiment with the latest cyber-security technology, keep up with the fast pace of change in cyber-security technology, and interact with other undergraduate students at different stages in their undergraduate careers. 2. Development of a new undergraduate course on applied cyber-security. This course provides hands-on experience with using the latest security tools, and designing and implementing secure systems. 3. Development of a repository of cyber-security education-related materials, making them available via the Web. The goal is to provide useful materials that are beyond course syllabi and lecture notes. 4. Dissemination of the results from this project to the CISE community. The methods for dissemination includes collaborating with faculties and students from other institutions via workshops, a TA training program, making course materials available on the Web, and publication and participation in CISE education-related conferences. 5. Increasing participation in the project activities of underrepresented groups by involving faculty and student from historically black colleges and universities, and other minority institutions. 6. Evaluation of the project results at regular intervals, and making modifications or extensions a needed. This evaluation will be based on the inputs from the students who take the new course and participate in the cyber-security house, industry who employ these students, and the instructors who teach the new course or supervise student in the cyber-security house. An important aspect of this project is the inclusion of survivability as an integral aspect of the educational topics proposed. Rather than focusing on the more traditional attack\/detection paradigm, students are taught how to design software systems that are less vulnerable to attack and that are designed to survive such attack and provide some level of continuing service.","title":"Mainstreaming Cybersecurity Research and Practice into Undergraduate Education","awardID":"0306105","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1709","name":"CISE EDUCAT RES & CURRIC DEVEL"}}],"PIcoPI":["290193",213692,"508532","510094"],"PO":["551712"]},"81874":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/><br\/>EIA-0305859<br\/>Jean C.

The purpose of the study is to determine which universities\/departments\/programs are most successful at recruiting and retaining female students, and what factors favor female success over time. The programs are hypothesized to be differentially responsive to female students due to differences in academic culture, operationalized in terms of the availability of mentorship, role models, peer support networks, grant programs, and other resources at the departmental, university, and disciplinary levels. These measures of organizational culture will be correlated with measures of student outcomes and self-reports of student experiences. Data about students' experiences will be collected through a web-based survey of a sample of 5,000 students, followed by three face-to-face interviews with an estimated 155 students, over-sampling for females, over a two-year period. In addition, faculty, administrators and staff in the study programs will be interviewed by telephone and in person. <br\/><br\/>Intellectual merit. Previous research has identified culture as among the most important factors that discourage girls and women from studying computer science. This project contributes to knowledge in this area by operationalizing culture in the context of academic IT programs and systematically investigating its contribution to student experiences and outcomes. The project will identify encouraging and discouraging factors, and produce comparative statistics, that can be used as a baseline in future research on IT education and gender, much as this project draws on findings from previous research on female students in computer science.<br\/><br\/>Broader impacts. As the need for information technology professionals continues to grow, so too does the need to engage women and girls in courses of study that will qualify them for IT-related careers. Findings of which factors encourage or discourage the success of women students can be used to inform programmatic recommendations aimed at moving more women into the IT pipeline through a diverse range of educational programs. To the extent that new IT paradigms such as are taught in schools of information, informatics, education, and business help to create those cultural associations, they can contribute to reducing the persistent gender segregation in academic IT-related programs and thus IT employment.","title":"ITWF: Toward Gender Equitable Outcomes in IT HIgher Education: Beyond Computer Science","awardID":"0305859","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1713","name":"WORKFORCE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}}],"PIcoPI":[213535,"427342",213537,"248405"],"PO":["564181"]},"85900":{"abstract":"This collaborative project (with Dandekar at Drexel, proposal 03-22795), performing an experimental investigation of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems, aims at designing and testing novel antenna systems for wideband digital wireless communication systems to provide designers with new data points. The experimental program is divided between two testbeds. The first testbed (implemented at Drexel) focuses on the electromagnetic propagation characteristics of the MIMO channel, while the second testbed (implemented at UT-Austin) makes use or the electromagnetic characterization to examine the channel impact of the higher network layers. Systems with MIMO communication links, fueled by the increasing demand for high-speed and high-quality mobile communication, use multiple antenna arrays, one at the transmitter and one at the receiver, to take advantage of the spatial dimension of the propagation channel. When properly designed, multi-array communication links can provide multi-fold increases in link throughput in addition to reductions in channel variation which in turn may be used to provide higher rates to single users, lower delay links, or to allow multiple users to coexist in the spatial channel. Because of this advantages, MIMO capability is being considered for indoor local area networks (LAN)s, cellular multimedia data networks, and broadband wireless access. However, without careful design, the results of electromagnetic interaction, such as mutual coupling, may correlate the channel coefficients, thus resulting in a loss in terms of capacity or error probability. Real experimental propagation and experimental data are needed to correlate the tradeoffs between different antenna designs, antenna placements, scattering models, channel bandwidth, and transceiver algorithms. These research involves designing and building two experimental platforms for wideband MIMO propagation channel measurement and real-time prototyping.

Although numerous improvements on RED have been proposed recently, such as Adaptive RED, SRED, REM, and BLUE, many of the fundamental weaknesses inherent in all of these AQM protocols have not been overcome, including over-parameterization, design and implementation complexity, and the lack of robustness to varying traffic mixtures. <br\/><br\/>The proposed research focuses on developing a new generation of active congestion control mechanisms based on the concept of optimal error diffusion discovered in signal processing and extensively used today in this field. Notably a duality exists between the mechanisms in packet marking or dropping with that of optimal dithering and quantization in signal processing. More precisely, (binary) quantization is analogous to packet marking where the average queue length, used as the input to RED, is quantized to \"on\" (marking) or \"off\" (no marking). The quantization (marking) error is then diffused over to subsequent quantization (marking) operations. Optimal quantization or dithering is attained with the so-called error diffusion filter, which, when applied to the AQM problem leads to remarkably efficient congestion control mechanisms coined here as Diffusion Early Marking (DEM). Unlike many AQM systems, random variable generation is not required as error diffusion attains optimal (pseudo-random) dithering, and more importantly DEM only requires a single control parameter which is designed based on the estimation of active flows or on other network statistics measuring congestion. As such, the proposed methods rely on cross level interactions for improved AQM performance. Expectation maximization (EM) algorithms and other simpler statistical methods applied on ECN markings, for instance, promise to provide adequate and robust estimates of congestion. <br\/><br\/>The mechanisms in DEM thus allow it to maintain a stable average queue length with a varying number of flows. Preliminary results on the design and optimization of DEM are remarkably promising. There are however, numerous open problems that need to be addressed prior to its implementation including: (a) methods for the optimal design of parameters controlling rate and queue-length based packet drop mechanisms, (b) fast and robust estimation of the number of active flows and network congestion based on packet header information and\/or queue dynamics, (c) diffusion mechanisms for networks with mixed traffic including web mice and elephants, (d) development of DEM differentiated service mechanisms. <br\/><br\/>The major contribution of the proposed research is on the application of the rich theories of quantization and robust estimation to the design of novel and robust AQM mechanisms that rely on cross-layer information. The new AQM mechanisms, in concert with the estimation framework to be developed, promise to adequately control the congestion of networks with various traffic mixtures and non-stationary traffic dynamics. <br\/><br\/>An important aspect of the proposed work is the testing of DEM routers with real traffic in an experimental and scalable testbed. The availability of this testbed will be valuable in providing students with a deeper understanding of difficult network concepts, such as congestion control and active queue management, and allowing then to gain hands-on experience in network traffic management and control.","title":"ITR: Optimal Diffusion Mechanisms for Fast and Robust TCP Congestion Control","awardID":"0312851","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["409073","322931"],"PO":["7594"]},"83536":{"abstract":"Wireless video sensor networks have important applications. In addition to their traditional surveillance and monitoring applications, these networks have recently found many new applications for enhancing national security, reducing the impact of security breaches on the nation's critical infrastructure, and improving the government's ability to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from both man-made and catastrophic events. This project will examine a wireless video sensor network that is designed for surveillance over an extended period of time. Consequently, this project will explore several definitions for network lifetime, taking into account the percentage of nodes required to remain alive (corresponding to network coverage) and the different priorities of nodes based on their locations. <br\/><br\/>The PIs will consider several important factors that affect network lifetime, including base-station placement and network connectivity topology. An analysis of power dissipation behavior at video sensor nodes suggests that communication consumes significantly more energy than any other node activity. This power consumption can be controlled effectively by monitoring and adjusting the power level of the transmitter and the network traffic routing topology. By adjusting the topology of the network through intelligent base station placement and network connectivity among the video sensor nodes, we can optimize the transmitter power of video sensor nodes, thus extending network lifetime. We have found that techniques and algorithms developed in the field of computational geometry can help us obtain a good understanding of the nature of the problem and identify where difficulties lie. More important, such approaches enable us to develop very useful performance bounds to characterize properties of wireless video sensor networks, which is the basis to further development of customized solutions. In this research, we plan to further explore algorithms and techniques from computational geometry to study the impact of topology control (base-station placement, temporal topology, traffic routing) on network performance and characterize basic properties for wireless video sensor networks.

In this project, new packet-based scheduling algorithms are developed and tested for high-performance Internet router operation. Fair scheduling algorithms are also incorporated in the crossbar to allocate bandwidths proportional to the request reservations of the packets. Both flow-based and port-based fair scheduling algorithms are designed similar to the deficit round-robin technique.

Both intuition and our Monte-Carlo simulation definitively indicate that the presence of such communication and load-transfer delays in distributed systems can lead to the failure of traditional load balancing algorithms. Thus, a delay-inclusive analytical framework is needed for the dynamics of task computing, and it is within such a framework that the development and optimization of delay-inclusive load-balancing policies can be realized.<br\/><br\/>The objectives of this program are to develop a general analytical framework for modeling the stochastic dynamics of delay-infested distributed systems and utilize it to develop load-balancing strategies that mitigate the performance degradation or failure caused by communication and load-transfer delays. The modeling is developed within a novel, regeneration-based queuing framework, and the load-balancing optimization will be carried out by means of statistical learning and stochastic prediction. The load-balancing strategies developed in this program will be tested in a physical distributed-system environment with realistic delays. To do so, a distributed-computing test-bed will be developed and deployed connecting existing data searching computers at UTK with a miniature clone system to be developed at UNM.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: The work proposed here is motivated by (but not limited to) practical, pressing issues arising in the current work done by the Co-PIs (at UTK) on The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National DNA Index System (NDIS) and its Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) software. The projected growth of this NDIS database and in the demand for searches of its contents necessitates migration to a parallel computing platform, and potentially to large-scale distributed systems, where the database is distributed or duplicated over geographically distant centers which are connected by means of a bandwidth-limited shared communication medium. The outcomes of this program will not only benefit the above systems but also a broad range of public, private and government database systems that perform searches over distributed sites.<br\/>The proposed research will also be utilized to improve the operation of large-scale virtual laboratories. The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at UNM has created an efficient way for the remote control of instruments and simulations over the Internet. This approach is applicable to both industry and distance education, and it is currently operational and accessible for designated users. However, this platform has not been tested with a large number of users in a real, distributed environment. The methodology in this research will be applied to enhance the performance of the existing educational platform and scale up its reach to a large network of institutions worldwide. This activity will also provide tremendous training opportunities in state-of-the-art information technology for graduate and undergraduate students.","title":"ITR Collaborative Research: Modeling and Mitigation of Communication-Delay Effects on Load Balancing in Large-Scale Distributed Systems","awardID":"0312611","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2006-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["465604","417282"],"PO":["7594"]},"83459":{"abstract":"The proposed research focuses on the dynamics of information flow and security in complex networks with respect to failures and attacks.

In a semistaticP2P network, peers are likely to remain participants in the network over long periods of time (e.g. compute servers), and are capable of providing reasonably high availability and response-time guarantees.

Built upon this routing core is support for transactional semantics, which enhances scalability by aggregating commits within a local overlay before propagating them to the global overlay. Finally, robustness and availability are incorporated by suitable replication through synthetic demand generation.

Dropped calls in cellular communication are often attributable to fading. A very effective and recent technique used to combat fading is to use multiple antennas at both input (transmitter end) and output (receiver end). The term space-time communication channel is used to describe the fading, wireless communication channel in the presence of multiple input and output antennas. Multiple input and output can be used to either increase the reliability of a wireless communication channel or else increase the rate at which information can be transmitted by a factor potentially equal to the number of transmit antennas. When used to both increase reliability and rate of information transfer, there is a tradeoff between the increase in information rate and the corresponding reliability of the communication link. This tradeoff is referred to as the rate-diversity tradeoff. A principal goal in the present project is the design of signal sets that will allow the user to pick an operating point along the rate diversity tradeoff curve. Other goals include helping define and achieve the limits of the space-time communication channel.<br\/>More specific objectives include the design of signal sets that achieve the rate-diversity tradeoff and that are easy to decode, the study of alternative relevant notions of channel capacity such as delay-limited channel capacity, the study of other relevant channel models including those incorporating channel memory and correlated path gains, the study of the space-time channel in the presence of feedback as well as in the presence of sources having a multi-resolution capability.","title":"ITR Collaborative Research: Achieving the Rate-Diversity Tradeoff in Space-Time Codes","awardID":"0325781","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["438652"],"PO":["564898"]},"86528":{"abstract":"Recent advances in processing (in particular, network processors) and storage provide the technological foundation for a new generation of continuous-monitoring measurement systems that can continuously and selectively capture, process, and store packet\/packet-header information for high-bandwidth links for periods of time ranging from hours to days.

For smooth nonlinear problems, traditional nonlinear methods, such as Newton's methods, are capable of reducing the global nonlinearities at a nearly quadratic convergence rate but become very slow once the local singularities appear somewhere in the computational domain, even if this happens to only a few components of a largenonlinear system. <br\/>The proposed algorithm is motivated by the class of nonlinear preconditioning algorithms introduced by Cai and Keyes in 2001 for solving algebraic nonlinear equations that have unbalanced nonlinearities.<br\/>In nonlinear preconditioning, the global problem is partitioned into subproblems, and subspace nonlinear eliminations are performed on all subproblems. <br\/>The subproblem are then 'glued' together by a Schwarz type domain decomposition method. Due to the subspace nonlinear elimination, the local singularities are removed, and the global system therefore has more uniform nonlinearity. A family of such algorithms will be studied using a combination of multilevel\/multigrid, domain decomposition, nonlinear preconditioning, and nonlinear elimination methods. Roughly speaking, in these algorithms, domain decomposition provides the parallelism, multilevel provides the scalability with respect to the problem size and to the number of processors on parallel computers, and nonlinear elimination removes the sensitivity to the local singularities.<br\/>Several important application problems will be considered, including the steady state incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with high Reynolds number and the optimization of a steady state biofluid problem.

Their ends are polarized in that each one exhibits unique and specific biochemical moieties. The objectives of the proposed work include establishing the scientific and technical basis for making nano-interconnects from MTs by developing end-specific capping agents to attach to the ends of the MTs, via creation of a combinatorial\/phage library. Also, specific ligands to be attached to functionalized metal pads will be identified and synthesized. Attachment control and selectivity will be achieved by creating complementary molecular patterns on the ends of the ligands and capping agents using affinity group - bifunctional reagent complexes and recombinant peptide stretches. Metallization research will provide key insights into the little known area of metal biomolecular interactions with the goal of depositing thin Cu and Au coatings on the interior and\/or exterior surfaces of the MTs to improve conductivity. Multiscale modeling and computer simulations will be used to guide research on molecular recognition at the ligand\/cap interface and on the effects of geometric and chemical factors on the controlled assembly and disassembly of MT nano-interconnects.

Motivated by the needs of smart spaces consisting of networked appliances and interactive mobile devices, the PI will revisit the idea of user-interface generation. Instead of a single, fixed user-interface generator for all applications, the PI will explore the possibility of multiple domain-specific generators. He will develop a general user-interface architecture that allows different generators to share code and their clients to incrementally customize them. To ensure generality of the architecture, he will consider the needs both of mobile and desktop computing, the latter in two domains for which user-interface generation seems to be particularly well suited, namely research applications and teaching of introductory programming. The PI's architecture is based on a model of user-interaction that treats user-interfaces as editors of logical structures of objects. It consists of several layers including external encapsulated application objects, a set of logical structures, editors of these structures, and an external toolkit. In addition, it includes objects that automatically connect objects in adjacent layers. The PI's hypothesis is that emergence of programming and user-interface conventions allows these connections to be made more or less automatically for the vast majority of applications in the domains under consideration. He will develop an algorithm for automatically identifying the behavior of the external application and toolkit objects from the patterns used in the signatures of the methods of these objects. Unlike the traditional approach of requiring an application to adapt to the (programming) interfaces provided by the tool, this algorithm will allow the tool to adapt to the interfaces provided by the application. The PI will also provide an axiomatic scheme for formally specifying the default patterns assumed by the generator, which can be customized to specify domain-specific patterns and associated semantics. Based on these formal specifications, parameterized algorithms will be developed for creating textual and graphical presentations of application objects, and automatically implementing commands to edit these presentations, including commands to undo and synchronize these objects, which require an understanding of the semantics of objects. The PI will develop efficient implementation techniques to ensure that the cost of generating and using a user-interface on a mobile device is low, including a technique to retarget a user-interface generated for a particular appliance to a new appliance with the same logical structure. The work will be evaluated by identifying a representative set of applications and devices from each of the domains under consideration.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This project will improve the state of the art in user interface generation, in that instead of requiring a separate implementation for each pair of mobile and appliance devices, just a single implementation will be needed for each mobile device. The research will lead to fundamental changes in the way introductory programming is taught, by allowing students to focus on programming concepts rather than user-interface implementation, and will also increase productivity of research projects by greatly reducing the cost of implementing the user-interfaces of demonstration applications. The software developed will be distributed via the Internet.","title":"User-interface generation for mobile and desktop computing","awardID":"0312328","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6845","name":"HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7496","name":"COLLABORATIVE SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["533215"],"PO":["565227"]},"81689":{"abstract":"Much of the past and recent research in program optimization has focused on developing new algorithms to perform a particular optimization or transformation.

While there are still avenues of promising research for particular optimizations, we are at the point where the performance gains of a new or improved optimization algorithm is usually small?an improvement of a few percent is typical. Today?s challenge for optimization research is to develop new techniques and approaches that yield performance improvements that go beyond today?s small single digit improvements. In this research, we address this challenge by investigating and developing an innovative framework and system for continuously and adaptively applying optimizations. Our system, the Continuous Compiler (CoCo), applies optimizations both statically at compile-time and dynamically at run-time using optimization plans developed at compile time and adapted at run time.<br\/>Rather than focusing on developing new optimization algorithms (e.g., a new register allocation algorithm, a<br\/>new loop interchange algorithm) or improving existing optimizations (e.g., better coloring heuristics, better placement algorithms), the proposed research focuses on understanding the interaction of existing optimizations and the efficacy of static and dynamic optimizations.

Since these processes occur over microseconds to seconds, much beyond the scope of traditional dynamics simulations, new techniques are needed to provide insights into detailed, local motions to supplement experiments. In this project, funded jointly by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Computational Math Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the PI will develop, compare, and apply two rigorous and complementary path-generation methods, Elber's stochastic path approach (SPA) and Chandler's transition path sampling (TPS), to study the conformational transitions between closed and open states for human DNA polymerase beta (pol beta) complexed with DNA template\/primer. This millisecond process is thought to be key in maintaining DNA synthesis fidelity. With these new tools, the PI will pursue several fundamental biological questions related to DNA synthesis fidelity, including the identification of slow conformational steps that steer the enzyme toward the chemistry-competent state and determination of rate-limiting steps in the enzyme's pathway. Atomic-level mechanistic insights, as well as associated free-energy barriers, will be delineated and related to enzyme function. The methodology developed is widely applicable to many other fundamental processes in molecular biophysics, and the biological findings will provide atomic-level interpretations to puzzling experimental variations in catalytic rates and error frequencies.

The goal of this project is to dissect the conformational aspects of the selectivity and fidelity of DNA repair process.

The PI will employ modeling and simulation by novel path-generation schemes that can capture large-scale long-time processes to study these polymerase mechanisms to explain fidelity. Such information has important ramifications to our understanding the fundamental DNA synthesis and repair fidelity processes.

Applications range from battlefield scenarios to responding to natural and human-made disasters. In these situations the ability to communicate, even at low rates, is extremely valuable for coordinating efforts and sharing vital information. Most ad hoc network routing and data forwarding algorithms are designed for networks that are always connected. While it is certainly desirable to maintain a connected network, various conditions may cause a mobile ad hoc network to become partitioned, meaning that there is no single-hop or multiple-hop route between some (or all) source\/destination node pairs. Node mobility, limited radio range, physical obstacles, severe weather, wide deployment area or other physical factors, might preclude some nodes from communicating with others and result in a partitioned network. <br\/><br\/>The existence of network partitioning requires a new approach other than the traditional \"store-and-forward\" routing paradigm used in most current ad hoc routing algorithms, in which messages are dropped if no route is found to reach a destination. Instead, a device should be able to buffer and carry the messages until it has a chance to forward them. This project focuses on the development of a novel \"Message Ferrying\" (MF) scheme, inspired by its real life analog, that implements this \"store, carry and forward\" routing paradigm. The main idea of the MF scheme is to introduce non-randomness in the movement of nodes and exploit such non-randomness to help deliver data. The MF scheme overcomes partitioning in a mobile ad-hoc network by using a set of mobile nodes, called message ferries. These nodes have the responsibility to carrying messages between disconnected nodes by moving around the deployed area according to known routes and communicating with other nodes they meet. By using ferries as relays, nodes can communicate asynchronously with other nodes that are disconnected. The proposed work will consist of three main components:<br\/><br\/>-The development of fundamental architectures, algorithms and protocols leading to successful designs of message ferrying systems,<br\/>-The construction of system prototypes to provide a realistic understanding of the challenges in building and deploying message ferrying systems, and <br\/>-Interfacing with on-going investigations of two contexts in which message ferrying can play an important role, namely surface transportation systems and robotic teams <br\/><br\/>This work is among the first to investigate in-depth the use of non-random node mobility to assist in providing data connectivity in a partitioned network. This will have the effect of enhancing the usability of mobile ad hoc networks in contexts where such disconnection is inevitable. It may also lead to the development of systems (e.g., on college campuses) where message ferrying is used as a low-cost, grass roots messaging solution. We are also committed to activities that will promote the broader impact of the proposed work including, the development of modules based on our research for graduate and undergraduate classes, continued emphasis on inclusion of under-represented groups within our research efforts and outreach activities to Atlanta-based historically black colleges and universities.","title":"ITR: Message Ferrying: Mobility-Assisted Data Delivery in Highly Partitioned Networks","awardID":"0313062","effectiveDate":"2003-09-15","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["550428","550429"],"PO":["7594"]},"83548":{"abstract":"Mueller<br\/>Whalley<br\/>Healy <br\/><br\/>Embedded systems with temporal constraints rely on timely scheduling<br\/>and a priori knowledge of worst-case execution times.

The second track will produce an open community toolkit that greatly expands generality and capabilities for video analysis, video input and output. In addition to these goals of moving from local to distributed users, tools and data will evolve in an ongoing process of user testing, piloting, and software packaging, involving the community and refining the tools based on their experiences. Project results at each interim milestone will be disseminated broadly for enhancing scientific and technological understanding, especially to conferences and journals and complemented by an open website for sharing ongoing research, technical developments, technical reports and software releases to be downloaded to user communities. Video Collaboratory toolkits will be made available to participating institutions with efforts made to spur adoption that will facilitate multiple communities using collaborative commentary around video. <br\/><br\/>The initial focus of our project is the human sciences, with the aim of leveraging video records to enhance the learning sciences, education, teaching and training. We also expect that video application and infrastructure work can provide significant support to the physical sciences, since video is an important data type for scientific visualization and primary empirical data, and several Grid initiatives use video databases integrally. We anticipate producing open-source video software that can be utilized in the current Grid and Middleware platform initiatives. This could enable a new primary software layer, a set of standards for video analysis and collaboration middleware, and the potential for a substantial broader impact as an outcome of this work.","title":"Collaborative Research: ITR: A Digital Video Collaboratory to Integrate IT Innovations in Video Analysis, Sharing and Collaboration into Scientific Research Communities","awardID":"0326497","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1707","name":"ADVANCED LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES"}}],"PIcoPI":["560145",226637],"PO":["564318"]},"90742":{"abstract":"The ACM Special Interest Group in Data Communications (SIGCOMM) will sponsor a one-day workshop on \"Networking Education: How to Educate the Educators?\" on August 25, 2003, preceding the annual ACM SIGCOMM conference in Karlsruhe, Germany. The goal of the workshop is to bring together faculty from a broad spectrum of academic institutions, industry engineers and scientists, and others with an interest in education to discuss curriculum design and teaching practices in the field of computer networks. This workshop is the successor of the very successful workshop \"Workshop on Computer Networking: Curriculum Designs and Educational Challenges\" held in conjunction with SIGCOMM<br\/>2002.<br\/><br\/>This workshop will focus on (i) tips and advice for new computer networking instructors, (ii) the refinement of the model curricula for a first (undergraduate) course in networking, (iii) the continuing evolution of graduate-level curricula in the area, and (iv) variations in the way that computer networking is taught around the world. The workshop will provide an opportunity to discuss these and other related issues; to share viewpoints, experiences, and materials; and to learn what others are doing, and considering doing in the area. The workshop will produce a report detailing the attendees' discussions and will serve as a springboard for future activity in the area.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit of this request is clear.

This left the Computer Networking field with a large 5 to 10 year void in the production of new professors for academia in the IT area. We see this workshop as an opportunity to regroup and make up for lost opportunities in assisting the newest group of networking educators in training the next generation of IT professionals. <br\/><br\/>This proposal requests funding to assist up to 16 United States-based faculty members to attend and participate in this workshop. The awards will be primarily targeted at faculty from 4-year colleges and universities who would not otherwise have the funds to attend the workshop or ACM SIGCOMM 2003. Given that the workshop is targeted broadly at all faculty in the computer networking area (not just those with the research funds to attend SIGCOMM), the grant will help broaden the base of participants, and serve to make the workshop a truly community-wide event.","title":"Networking Education: How to Educate the Educators?; Karlsruhe, Germany","awardID":"0349407","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2004-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":[237796],"PO":["565090"]},"81755":{"abstract":"Models to Support Performance-Engineering<br\/>of Global Computations<br\/><br\/>This Proposal focuses on modeling and scheduling methodologies that will enable global computing,<br\/>thus extending Computational Grids and high-performance distributed computing to<br\/>a global level.<br\/>There are three objectives to the work proposed:<br\/>1. develop novel models of complex emerging global and Grid computing platforms for<br\/>both resource availability and resource classi_cation, attempting to unify the performance characteristics<br\/>of both platform types.<br\/>2.

Many applications in image analysis and computer vision involve analysis of large-dimensional data by projecting them linearly to low-dimensional subspaces. In view of their computational efficiency such linear projections have become standard in certain applications. However, for recognizing objects from their images, there is seldom a discussion on finding \"optimal\" linear representations. Many societal, commercial, and scientific operations, such as homeland security and biometrics, rely heavily on image-based recognition and the recognition performance becomes a vital factor. This project aims to provide efficient algorithms for finding linear and non-linear representations that perform optimally in the context of object recognition. We propose to achieve this goal by: (i) formulating the search for optimal linear representations as that of optimization on Grassmann manifolds, (ii) using the geometry of Grassmannians to develop algorithms for finding optimal linear representations, (iii) analyzing the convergence properties and the theoretical limits of the proposed optimization techniques, and (iv) demonstrating the potential significant performance improvement on problems wherever linear representations are applicable. Since there are numerous applications utilizing dimension reduction using linear projections, including object recognition, image and text retrieval, subspace tracking, and nonlinear filtering, the potential benefits of the proposed research are tremendous. This research will be built on tools for stochastic optimization and statistical inferences on nonlinear manifolds, tools that will prove beneficial in many other applications.<br\/><br\/>This research will also enhance significantly the learning and research environment on computer vision at the Florida State University. Utilization of geometric and statistical approaches to applications in computer vision makes this a multidisciplinary effort to the benefit of all participants, including both graduate and undergraduate students.

These systems become harder to develop due to increasing complexity and functionality. Furthermore, these systems are frequently used in safety critical environments, and thus, require high assurance in reliability. The design and implementation of distributed hybrid systems remains a challenging task.<br\/><br\/>This project investigates key technologies (software tools for hierarchical modeling, and optimization-based hybrid control) for analysis and synthesis of cooperative unmanned vehicles. Multi-vehicle systems need to adapt to the task in hand and commands from a remote user. To facilitate the design of this class of hybrid systems, the following research thrusts are addressed: (1.) Hierarchical modeling of multi-vehicle systems. This thrust focuses on developing a software toolkit for modeling distributed multi-vehicle systems. This toolkit allows a modular and hierarchical approach to programming deliberative and reactive behaviors in distributed autonomous operation. Formal definitions for sequential composition, hierarchical composition, and parallel composition allow the bottom-up development of complex hybrid systems. (2.)Distributed hybrid control and optimization. This thrust addresses hybrid control of a team of vehicles using optimal control graphs and model predictive control (MPC). Determining the proper level in the control hierarchy at which MPC should be imposed is important. In the extreme, MPC can be used for the entire system; however this may not be advantageous when local controllers for vehicles have already been well established. In evaluating this trade-off, the complexity of the algorithm, computation time, and stability are considered.<br\/><br\/>The software and analysis tools developed under this effort have a broader impact, as they can also be applied to other domains such as distributed power plants, transportation systems, and formation flight systems.

The core technologies can also be extended to other information technology areas from image tracking and detection, to control of complex biological systems.","title":"ITR: Bayesian Integrated Vision, Estimation, and Control for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","awardID":"0313350","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["298117","402216"],"PO":["335186"]},"93757":{"abstract":"Project Summary<br\/><br\/>The Human Genome Project has opened the flood-gate of biological data, which has resulted in the generation of enormous amount of sequence, structure, expression, and interaction data at rates that far exceed our current capability of analyzing and interpreting them. New ideas and approaches are urgently needed to establish greatly improved capabilities for biological data analysis. Data clustering is fundamental to mining a large quantity of biological data. The goals of this project are (a) to develop a highly effective and general framework for biological data clustering, which is applicable to a large class of biological data analysis problems; (b) to demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework as a general-purpose clustering tool, through application to four challenging biological data analysis problems; (c) to implement this clustering framework as a set of library functions, in a similar fashion to LINPACK\/LAPACK, with which other researchers can build their own clustering capabilities more efficiently; (d) to provide insight on several biological problems through clustering analysis; and (e) to train students\/postdocs how to build biological data analysis tools, using our clustering framework as a training ground. The foundation of our framework is a minimum spanning tree (MST) representation of a data set and its relationships with clustering. Our preliminary studies have revealed that (i) there is a natural connection between MSTs and the concept of clustering, which can help to reduce a multi-dimensional data clustering problem to a tree-partitioning problem; (ii) clustering problems with general objective functions, defined on (minimum spanning) trees, can be solved optimally and efficiently; and (iii) MSTs provide a natural framework for solving a more general class of clustering problems, i.e., extracting data clusters from a noisy background. Additional preliminary studies have also revealed that MSTs have such rich properties related to clustering that further investigation could lead to significantly more effective ways of clustering and analyzing biological data. Our research will be organized and carried out in five tasks.<br\/><br\/>o Investigation of fundamental properties of MSTs versus clustering: We will investigate fundamental relationships between MSTs and clustering. New insights and discoveries about their relationships will be used to lay the foundation for development of more effective ways of clustering.<br\/><br\/>o Investigation and development of MST-based clustering algorithms and statistical analysis methods: We will investigate and develop a large class of MST-based algorithms for several clustering related problems. In addition, we will investigate and develop effective statistical analysis tools for assessing statistical significance and robustness of clustering results.<br\/><br\/>o Development of improved analysis capabilities for four selected application problems: We will apply our clustering framework to four biological data analysis problems: (1) gene expression data analysis, (2) regulatory binding site identification, (3) two-hybrid data analysis, and (4) phylogenetic tree clustering analysis.<br\/><br\/>o Implementation of our MST-based clustering framework as library functions: We will implement our MST-based clustering-related algorithms as APIs (Application Programming Interface), which can be used easily by other researchers in their own data analysis software. In addition, we will implement our clustering tools as a Web server for community service.<br\/><br\/>o Training and education: As MST provides such a rich set of attractive properties relevant to clustering, we will use our MST-based clustering framework as a training platform to teach students\/postdocs how to develop biological data analysis tools.<br\/><br\/>Our proposed study and development directly address the research challenges of the ITR program in the following areas:<br\/>o providing new computational, simulation and data-analysis methods and tools to model physical, biological,social, behavioral and mathematical phenomena, and<br\/>o improving our ability to understand, model and control the behavior of complex systems.","title":"ITR Collaborative Research: Combinatorial Algorithms for Biological Data Clustering","awardID":"0407204","effectiveDate":"2003-09-26","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["502611"],"PO":["565136"]},"83615":{"abstract":"This project investigates the basic question of how unlabeled data can be most effectively used together with labeled data in machine learning. The goals of this work are three-fold. First, the research aims to achieve a fundamental understanding of this problem, including new methods for reasoning about the kind of information unlabeled data can provide. Second, this research explores new algorithms for using large amounts of unlabeled data together with small amounts of labeled data and background knowledge, in order to achieve performance that greatly exceeds that available using only labeled data and more traditional methods today. The approaches used by the investigators include graph algorithms and random fields, Monte Carlo sampling and spectral methods, closely connected areas of computer science that have found application in computer vision, but that have yet to be fully exploited in machine learning. Finally, targeted applications, including text analysis, image classification, and intrusion detection for computer security, will be investigated to validate the theoretical principles that are developed, and to explore algorithms and suggest new directions for investigation.<br\/><br\/>The broader impact of this research will be to help enable new technologies to use the volumes of data that are being collected in so many new domains, and on such a great scale. Advances in our understanding of the possibilities for, and fundamental limits to, combining labeled and unlabeled data has the potential to impact many scientific fields, allowing researchers to more easily use the vast quantities of data that are available but not necessarily annotated for their own specific needs. It also may ultimately influence the future data collection initiatives that our society chooses to invest in.","title":"ITR: Machine Learning from Labeled and Unlabeled Data","awardID":"0312814","effectiveDate":"2003-09-01","expirationDate":"2006-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["485891","554195"],"PO":["491702"]}}
