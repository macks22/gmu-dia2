{"1188":{"abstract":"9503994 Samet One of the emerging areas of research is the integration of databases containing nontraditional data with conventional databases. New indexing methods are required in order to store and retrieve nontraditional data efficiently. These methods must capture the nature of the data and sort on this information. In this research the methods for integrating symbolic images into relational database systems will be extended to a more general case of images. The problem is how to match the stored image with an observed image that is presented to the database as a query, but is taken from a different viewpoint. A solution based on utilizing methods that are used in computer vision to solve these problems, and integrating these results into a relational (or any other) database system will be investigated. The solution is based on the use of geometric invariants. An additional research goal that extends this work into other nontraditional data types such as video data will also be performed. As video is becoming a common data type in information systems, data management systems should support this new kind of data. The important issue is how to extract contextual, spatial and temporal information from the video sequences in order to index on video data based on its contents. A solution that is based on gathering information about methods that are used for this purpose in computer vision, and adapting them so they can be used in the framework of database systems will be outlined. In particular, using a system the recognizes facial expressions from video sequences of a human face is suggested as a testbed. ***","title":"CISE Postdoctoral Program: Postdoctoral Research Associate in Experimental Science: Applying Computer Vision Methods to Image Databases","awardID":"9503994","effectiveDate":"1995-04-01","expirationDate":"1999-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["551003","95148"],"PO":["297837"]},"2752":{"abstract":"IRI-9509771 Ford, Kenneth M., and Canas, Alberto J.

Workshop: Smart Machines and Education: Perils and Promise This is partial funding for a workshop that is bringing together participants from a variety of disciplines that share an interest in how artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive science might serve as an enabling technology for learning. Additionally, some of the participants are interested in using what we have learned about intelligence itself (some of this from AI and cognitive models on computers) to build machines that support the learning process. Education is fast ceasing to be a child's preparation for adulthood and is becoming a lifelong process. Certainly, computers and communication will be at the center of this evolution. But beyond merely providing the interface, testing, and delivery component, what role can the specific `intelligent` capacities built into a machine play? This will be the central question that underlies the meeting's sessions on intelligent machine interaction, adaptivity, individual and group process es, and embedding of smart machines in the social milieu. The workshop is intended to help build disciplinary bridges and establish research and development agendas.","title":"Workshop Proposal: \"Smart Machines & Education: Perils and Promise\"- May 18-20, 1995","awardID":"9509771","effectiveDate":"1995-04-15","expirationDate":"1996-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6856","name":"ARTIFICIAL INTELL & COGNIT SCI"}}],"PIcoPI":[6437,6438],"PO":["54008"]},"1598":{"abstract":"This meeting was addressed by invited speakers who have made outstanding contributions to the field of computer algebra.

Scientists and engineers seeking practical ways to solve difficult combinatorial optimization problems are increasingly turning to local search and genetic algorithms. In addition, the past five years has seen a dramatic increase in researchers proposing new variants on these techniques, especially genetic algorithms. Recent work on genetic algorithms has strongly suggested the best algorithms interweave local search and genetic search techniques. This research has four main objectives: 1) produce a suite of local search methods and stochastic hill-climbing algorithms to test the difficulty of optimization problems, 2) produce a new test suite of complex problems which are resistant to local search and stochastic hill-climbing, 3) produce new hybridized genetic algorithms that can be sued to produce state-of-the-art results for applications in computer vision and geophysics, 4) conduct comparative studies of the major genetic algorithm search paradigms, including hybrids which utilize local search. In pursuit of this fourth objective, it will be necessary to compare different genetic algorithms, local search algorithms, and hybrids on both the controlled test suite of problems as well as large problems of practical importance.","title":"Comparisons and Applications of Local and Global Search","awardID":"9503366","effectiveDate":"1995-04-01","expirationDate":"1998-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6856","name":"ARTIFICIAL INTELL & COGNIT SCI"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2890","name":"CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES"}}],"PIcoPI":["164944","479306"],"PO":["565227"]},"633":{"abstract":"The semidefinite programming problem (SDP), including implementation of numerically stable interior point algorithms, mathematical properties of the feasible sets, and in particular applications of SDP in combinatorial optimization are being investigated. First, two versions of the primal-dual interior point SDP algorithm are being implemented. One version is in MATLAB and is intended as an easy to use and change software for small to medium size problems. Another implementation is in FORTRAN 90 and is intended for high performance parallel and vector\/pipelined machines and is meant to solve large scale problems. In addition feasibility of active set methods for SDP is being investigated. Next applications of SDP in general 0-1 integer programming problems are being studied. The feasibility of branch and bound SDP techniques which solve an SDP problem at each stage but may require far fewer branchings overall is being investigated. If such an approach is found to be practical, general purpose programs will be developed. In theoretical investigations, the following applications of SDP are being studied: parallel computational complexity of the Lovasz number of graphs, approximation algorithms for the minimum vertex cover problem, applications to the general matching problem, and polyhedrality of the feasible sets of SDPs under affine transformations. The connection of primal--dual method of linear and semidefinite programs to the problem of quadratically constrained quadratic programming is being investigated. In addition, those cones are being investiagted whose associated optimization problem leads to complementarity relations that are bilinear forms; programming, quadratically constrained quadratic programming and SDP are examples of such problems. For teaching plans, active participation in helping RUTCOR establish a masters program is planned. Courses in semidefinite programming and in computational biology in graduate school, and a course designed to survey various software available for optimization problems are being developed. At the undergraduate level teaching of courses in the affiliated departments of computer science, mathematics and statistics is expected. Also a textbook on SDP is in preparation.","title":"CAREER: Applications of Convex Programming in Combinatorial Optimization: A Mathematical, Algorithmic and Computational Study","awardID":"9501941","effectiveDate":"1995-04-01","expirationDate":"1999-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2890","name":"CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES"}}],"PIcoPI":["423516"],"PO":["187585"]},"568":{"abstract":"This CAREER project focuses on both research and educational goals. The research component of this project addresses fundamental questions in interactive systems such as programming environments or on-line access to travel services. A key factor for the success of interactive systems lies in their speed and, thus, in efficient algorithms for interactively handling requests. One powerful paradigm in the design of efficient algorithms is to reduce the amount of recomputation by storing essential information gathered during earlier computational steps in a suitable data structure for later use. In interactive situations an additional difficulty arises: The problem instance changes incrementally, which requires dynamic data structures. While efficient dynamic data structures are widely used, efficient dynamic data structures for graphs are still in the research phase. This project includes the following research goals: (1) Design of dynamic data structures which exploits recent progress in using approximation and randomization in the design of graph algorithms; (2) Applications of dynamic data structures to improve the efficiency of algorithms for incrementally changing problems. These applications can be used on problems which do not necessarily fit the dynamic framework. For example, using dynamic techniques, a faster algorithm for the consensus tree problem is explored. This algorithm has applications in computational biology and in the theory of databases; (3) Implementation of dynamic data structures for graphs, which extends the widely-used Library of Efficient Data Types and Algorithms (LEDA). The Educational Component of this CAREER Grant includes the goals in undergraduate and graduate education: (1) At the undergraduate level a basic goal is to redesign the senior-level algorithms course to teach the use of efficient advanced data structures by asking for implementations of algorithms in homework assignments and projects using LEDA; (2) A second basic goal is to promote the advancement of women engineers by: Counseling and mentoring female students; Giving presentations to industry and students; Participating in workshops which are sponsored by Cornell University's outreach program, Expanding Your Horizons Program, for (female) middle school students.","title":"CAREER: Design and Analysis of Efficient Graph Algorithms","awardID":"9501712","effectiveDate":"1995-04-01","expirationDate":"1996-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[1306],"PO":["150516"]},"1490":{"abstract":"This award supported the 1995 Workshop on Industrial Strength Formal Specification Techniques (WIFT'95), April 5-8, l995, Boca Raton, FL, brought together software engineering professionals from around the world to report on, analyze, and synthesize experiences related to the industrial applications of formal specification techniques.

Technology and pedagogical methods developed in testbed will be integrated into TELETECHNET, a state funded program in which Old Dominion University and community colleges will provide four-year programs. The first two years will be taught at the community colleges with the last two being provided by Old Dominion University to remote community college campuses via networked and televised course instructions. The project will consist of a one- year preparatory phase, covered by this proposal, and a three-year phase of research, development, and implementation to be covered by a follow-on proposal. Significant contributions of the proposed one-year project include: 1) refining an existing IRI prototype to provide an open-ended teaching\/learning environment with a set of basic features easy to use by students and faculty of all disciplines; 2) developing the basic concepts of new instructional methods to exploit the interactivity of the system in support of higher domains of learning; and 3) preparing to bring together a consortium of government, industry and academic individuals who are dedicated to innovative approaches to education for the 21st century. This will lay the foundation in providing Virginia with a cost-effective method of delivering high quality education remotely in support of some of the 50,000 additional students expected to enroll in Virginia's public colleges and universities by the year 2001. The proposed hardware\/software architectures use existing technologies but anticipate the wider availability of a high-speed Information superhighway and multimedia workstations in the near future. The architecture provides an open environment in which many types of teaching materials and inst ructional software can be incorporated. The prototype provides two-way video to remote sites; shared operation of X-window tools and applications; interactive note-taking; a VCR-like replay of past classes and ancillary material and a full motion video window which can display the instructor, a classroom demonstration, or any PC, Macintosh or X-window application. This instructional capability goes beyond traditional TV courses and traditional classrooms by enabling instructors and students to access multimedia generated from a variety of sources and to use group collaboration tools for interaction between two participants, among small groups, or entire classes. The system will provide audio-visual interaction and allow faculty and remote-site students to share the manipulation of software tools, such as spreadsheets or chemistry models. While the elements of IRI are currently technically feasible, a major portion of the project's efforts are directed to the developing of new student-centered teaching methods and paradigms which take advantage of the environment and to refining the hardware and software through experience of actual instructional needs. Key to the success of our approach is an interface which students and faculty from all disciplines can use with intimal training. This system will provide access to higher education, not only for traditional students, who for personal or financial reasons choose not to reside at a four-year institution. IRI will promote effective use of network and computer technology for all participating students and faculty. Exposure to technology-enabled interaction will help prepare students for the challenges of increased global competitiveness. Old Dominion University will consider the total project a success in developing a long-term self-sustaining system if half the TELETECHNET courses use IRI within five years, both faculty and students accept and benefit from this mode of teaching as demonstrated with such metr ics as cost satisfaction and there is an increase in the number of students completing four-year degrees. We will consider the one-year phase successful if we shall have used a version of the IRI system in a real class environment and identified the problems in that version. ***","title":"A Testbed for Collaborative Interactive Remote Instruction","awardID":"9552593","effectiveDate":"1995-04-01","expirationDate":"1997-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1109","name":"Division of RESEARCH ON LEARNING","abbr":"DRL"},"pgm":{"id":"7263","name":"NETWORKING INFRASTRUCT-EDUCAT"}}],"PIcoPI":["338005","22530"],"PO":["527266"]},"2430":{"abstract":"9508431 Weingarten This is a request for holding a workshop on the timely subject on Social Aspects of the National Information Infrastructure.
