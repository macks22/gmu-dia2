{"22908":{"abstract":"The idea of executing a transactional system under a lower isolation level than perfect Serializable isolation was introduced in a 1977 paper by IBM researchers, and implemented in IBM's DB2. It is now offered by most commercial DBMS systems supporting multi-user applications. Lower isolation levels permit more transactional threads to simultaneously execute an application, so processor resources are more effectively utilized. The tradeoff is that in perfect isolation, no update performed by one application thread can have any effect on data read and updated by an independent transactional thread; in lower isolation levels this is no longer the case. The intent is to use lower isolation levels only for \"safe\" applications, where the application code will not use isolation weaknesses to arrive at erroneous results. But the database field has no general method for deciding what applications are \"safe\". The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a method for evaluating large transactional application systems to determine what errors can arise at different isolation levels in common commercial use. This process of evaluation is to be known as Isolation Testing, and provides a list of all isolation problems that can occur in the workload. It is then possible to make modest changes in the database and application design to eliminate these errors and gain the advantage of a lower isolation level. Isolation Testing has the potential to make many of the largest commercial applications (e.g., banking, airline reservations) more efficient in their use of computer resources.","title":"Isolation Testing for Transactional Systems","awardID":"9711374","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}}],"PIcoPI":[57527,57528],"PO":["563751"]},"22919":{"abstract":"Unreliable failure detection has been gaining acceptance as a fundamental paradigm for fault-tolerant distributed computing.

Recently, the concepts of multiset decipherable (MSD), set decipherable (SD), and numerically decipherable (ND) codes were developed to handle some special problems in the transmission of information. Unique decipherability is a vital requirement in a wide range of coding applications where distinct sequences of code words carry different information. However, in several applications, it is necessary or desirable to communicate a description of a sequence of events where the information of interest is the set of possible events, including multiplicity, but where the order of occurrences is irrelevant. Suitable codes for these communication purposes need not possess the UD property, but the weaker MSD property. In other applications, the information of interest may be the presence or absence of possible events (or may be only the total number of events). The SD (or ND) property is adequate for such codes. This project extends the investigations carried out by several researchers on decipherability of codes. Unique decipherability, multiset decipherability, and set decipherability of codes turn out to be particular cases of a more general concept of decipherability in monoids which establishes a close connection between some classes of codes, called varieties of codes, and some classes of monoids, called codifiable varieties of monoids. This connection may allow the use of monoids to better understand decipherability of codes. Most of the procedures are based on game techniques, graph congruence techniques, categorical techniques, as well as techniques related to dominoes and to graph algorithms.","title":"Decipherability of Codes and Applications","awardID":"9700228","effectiveDate":"1997-09-15","expirationDate":"2000-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["472982"],"PO":["150516"]},"19260":{"abstract":"The essence of this research is a systematic classification of the variants of the multicast problems that present themselves in various networking and distributed systems applications, as well as algorithmic solutions to these problems in the spirit of \"competitive analysis\".

From the algorithmic point of view, which is the point of view taken in this proposal, the Multicast Problem can be defined as follows. Various network users issue online requests for a connection to certain multicast sources. The network either connects this request or rejects it (admission control decision). If a request is connected, a path with sufficient residual bandwidth is established starting at the requesting user and ending either at the source or at one of the users previously connected to the same source (route selection decision). The goal of these admission control and route selection decisions is to maximize the total number of users connected subject to the network capacity constraints. Namely, the number of connections to different sources passing through any edge should not exceed the capacity of that edge. The innovation in this research is in developing a unifying framework that simultaneously captures admission control and route selection decisions in their full generality. This framework can be generalized to include issues such as pricing policies, network design & synthesis, etc.","title":"Online Algorithms for Selective Multicast, Maximal Dense Trees, and Related Problems","awardID":"9700157","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["343097"],"PO":["150516"]},"19460":{"abstract":"Over the last decade, a dramatic increase has been observed in the ability of individual experimental scientists to generate and store data, which has not been matched by an equivalent development of adequate data management tools.

This problem will be studied in the project through an interdisciplinary approach. To directly probe brain mechanisms, neurophysiological experiments will be performed on awake behaving animals. Computer-based experiments with young children will be used to discover how children learn sequential behaviors and to test how to optimize such learning. Behavioral studies will be done on how human infants learn sequences. Cognitive and neural modeling will be used to discover brain designs and mechanisms to link the animal neurophysiological data to the human cognitive data. This interdisciplinary approach promises to produce insights that are beyond the scope of any single approach. Conducting experiments in two different animal species (monkeys and rats), in human infants, and in young children will permit identification of intelligent mechanisms that are preserved across different species. The animal studies will analyse the activity of large groups of single neurons to study how multiple neurons interact to generate intelligent behaviors. Neural modeling will probe the laws that govern these behaviors, and will make predictions that link brain to behavior. Through these analyses of how we learn and remember sequences of events, a foundation will be built for studying the neural basis of high-level cognitive operations such as planning and reasoning; for developing better educational software; and for applying models towards the solution of outstanding technological problems that require algorithms which emulate human intelligence.","title":"Learning and Intelligent Systems: Neurophysiological, Computational, and Educational Studies of Sequence Learning and Cognitive Planning","awardID":"9720333","effectiveDate":"1997-09-15","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8888","name":"LEARNING & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"1180","name":"HUMAN COGNITION & PERCEPTION"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"1191","name":"BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["562354","537408",60519,60520,"463935"],"PO":["564456"]},"29450":{"abstract":"","title":"Issues in Design of Lightwave Networks with Sparse Wavelength Conversion","awardID":"9796318","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4091","name":"NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["521840","119553"],"PO":["194325"]},"19231":{"abstract":"The purpose of this research is to design and analyze discrete algorithms solving hard combinatorial graph problems.

A bipartite graph is used to compare an optimal solution with a solution found by an approximation algorithm. It can be expected that this method will have many more applications. The research plan includes new approaches to algorithm design applicable to various problems in algorithmic graph theory including Steiner trees and the graph isomorphism problem.

The research project addresses a number of important issues in the design and interconnection of optical networks. The ultimate goal of the proposed work is to develop viable solutions for a seamless nationwide all-optical network infrastructure. The educational component includes development of graduate-level courses on all-optical networking and on internetwork architectures and protocols, integration of topics on lightwave technology in existing graduate and undergraduate introductory network courses, and active involvement of undergraduate students in network projects. In an all-optical network using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), information is transmitted as optical signals throughout the path from source to destination. By using multiple concurrent channels, each on a different wavelength, WDM has the potential to exploit the enormous information-carrying capacity of fiber and deliver an aggregate throughput that is several orders of magnitude higher than it is possible today. Given the installed base of optical fiber, and the maturing of optical component technologies, it appears that current network technologies will eventually evolve to an all-optical infrastructure. The deployment of such an infrastructure will cater to the needs of emerging bandwidth-intensive applications. However, large scale interconnection of optical networks raises a number of fundamental and challenging problems that require novel and innovative solutions. As part of his career development plan, the principal investigator proposes to address a number of these issues, including multiple access in broadcast-and-select WDM networks, traffic scheduling of unicast and multicast traffic, interconnection of photonic local area networks, architectural issues in wavelength routed backbone networks, dist ributed control, and issues related to the interaction among subnetwork and backbone protocols. Our work is expected to further our understanding of the characteristics of optical networks, and to provide insight on how to overcome some of the limitations of the technology. The objective is to produce an analytical framework that will make it possible to evaluate alternative architectures and protocols.","title":"CAREER: Towards an All-Optical Network Infrastructure: Interconnection of Photonic WDM Broadcast-and-Select Local Area Networks","awardID":"9701113","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["484227"],"PO":["234222"]},"21192":{"abstract":"The objectives of the proposed work are to (i) study frequency selective, fading communications channels and develop appropriate models to describe the channel's time variations, (ii) derive novel blind and decision feedback algorithms which explicitly take into account the time varying nature of the channel and (iii) develop the analytical tools to assess the applicability of different models under different conditions. Each time-varying tap coefficient of a frequency selective, fading channel is typically modeled as a random processes with low-pass power spectra. However, traditional adaptive techniques typically do not exploit this information. In the proposed work, Kalman filtering methods are derived to track the channel by employing a multichannel autoregressive description of the time-varying taps in a decision-feedback equalization framework. Fitting a model to the variations of the channel's taps is a challenging task because the tap coefficients are not observed directly. A linear method is proposed to estimate the channel's spectral characteristics from input\/output data, and consistency is shown. A different emerging framework will also be studied, where each time-varying tap coefficient is described (with respect to time) as a linear combination of a finite number of basis functions. Examples of such channels include periodically varying ones, where each multipath component exhibits a different Doppler shift or channels locally modeled by a truncated Taylor Series. It is shown that the estimation of the expansion parameters is equivalent to estimating the parameters of an FIR Single-Input-Many-Output (SIMO) system. By exploiting this equivalence, a number of different blind subspace methods are applicable, which h ave been originally developed in the context of time-invariant SIMO systems. Identifiability and performance issues will be investigated, as well as the effects of diversity combining, when multiple receiving antennas are available.","title":"Channel Estimation Under Frequency Selective Fading and Multipath","awardID":"9706658","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4096","name":"COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["126034"],"PO":["150411"]},"26483":{"abstract":"","title":"Graduate Research Fellowship Program","awardID":"9729223","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1101","name":"Division of GRADUATE EDUCATION","abbr":"DGE"},"pgm":{"id":"7172","name":"GRADUATE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS"}}],"PIcoPI":["398928"],"PO":["235156"]},"24074":{"abstract":"This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS) initiative. A key aim of this initiative is to understand how highly complex intelligent systems could arise from simple initial knowledge through interactions with the environment. The best real-world example of such a system is the human infant who progresses from relatively simple abilities at birth to quite sophisticated abilities by two-years-of-age. This research focuses on the development of reaching by infants because (a) only rudimentary reaching ability is present at birth; (b) older infants use their arms in a sophisticated way to exploit and explore the world; and (c) the problems facing the infant are similar to those an artificial system would face. The project brings together two computer scientists who are experts on learning control algorithms and neural networks, and two psychologists who are experts on the behavioral and neural aspects of infant reaching, to investigate and test various algorithms by which infants might gain control over their arms. The proposed research focuses on the control strategies that infants use in executing reaches, how infants develop appropriate and adaptive modes of reaching, the mechanisms by which infants improve their ability to reach with age, the role of sensory information in controlling the reach, and how such knowledge might be stored in psychologically appropriate and computationally powerful ways. Preliminary results suggest that computational models that are appropriate for modeling the development of human reaching are different in significant ways from traditional computational models. Understanding the mechanisms by which intelligence can develop through learning can have significant impact in many scientific and engineering domains because the ability to build such systems would be simpler and faster than engineering a system with the intelligence specified by the engineer and because systems based on interactive learning could rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions.","title":"Learning and Intelligent Systems: Developmental Motor Control in Real and Artificial Systems","awardID":"9720345","effectiveDate":"1997-09-15","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8888","name":"LEARNING & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"1180","name":"HUMAN COGNITION & PERCEPTION"}}],"PIcoPI":[60534,60535,"513288","189869"],"PO":["179262"]},"29420":{"abstract":"","title":"CAREER: Intelligent Planning and Control of Robotic Systems in a Perceptive Frame","awardID":"9796287","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2006-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["550894"],"PO":["335186"]},"29442":{"abstract":"","title":"Research in Multithreaded Dataflow and Hybrid Architectures","awardID":"9796310","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0406","name":"Office of INTL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING","abbr":"OISE"},"pgm":{"id":"5978","name":"EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4715","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2890","name":"CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES"}}],"PIcoPI":["13545","559679"],"PO":["197478"]},"19278":{"abstract":"It is widely believed that NP does not equal coNP. This means that there are coNP sets for which some elements require superpolynomial length proofs of membership. Are there coNP sets for which the average element requires superpolynomial length proofs of membership? Exponential length? One goal of this research is to find evidence that such sets exist. For example, what is a plausible complexity theoretic assumption under which these average case hard coNP sets exist? Such a result would generalize the study of average case complexity to work against nondeterministic algorithms. Furthermore, arguing for the existence of these sets is part of an approach to proving the independence of P not equal NP. It has already been argued that the existence of doubly exponentially -hard one way functions rules out P\/poly-natural proofs that SATISFIABILITY requires superpolynomial circuits. Furthermore, this implies that propositional proof systems with the interpolation property do not have polynomially bounded proofs that SAT is not in P\/poly. It might be possible to generalize the `natural proof\/interpolation' approach in order to prove an important independence result for SAT not in P\/poly. If average case hard coNP sets of the right type do exist, then there are no NP\/poly-natural proofs of SAT not in P\/poly. This would imply that propositional systems with the existential interpolation property do not have polynomially-bounded proofs of SAT not in P\/poly. Hard coNP sets would have two important consequences. 1) Generalize the known limits of P\/poly natural proofs to NP\/poly-natural proofs. 2) Extend independence results from systems with the interpolation property to systems with the existential interpolation property. The more powerful independence tools might be extensible to a proof system such as Extended Frege.","title":"coNP Sets Whose Average Proof of Membership is Long: TowardsIndependence Results for the P Versus NP Question","awardID":"9700216","effectiveDate":"1997-09-15","expirationDate":"1999-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[48899],"PO":["150516"]},"23140":{"abstract":"The award will support a program of research on problems of coordination in networks.

The development of these testbeds depends on the integration of the following research activities: Tissue modeling and rendering. For effective surgical training in virtual environments, deformable models of tissue are needed with sufficient accuracy, yet fast enough for real time interaction. Beginning with continuum models of solid behavior, suitable approximations will be developed that account for the compliance of tissue and the deformation of organs in the presence of a surgical tool. Methods for representing and rendering tissue shape, especially aspects that affect lighting models that provide important visual cues, will be compared. Haptic interaction with simulated models. There has been little work done or kinesthetic perception and display of compliant surfaces. Subjects' perception of compliance will be measured under a variety of conditions to provide requirements for object modeling algorithms, and for teleoperation and haptic display schemes with high fidelity. Real time data fusion and 3-D visualization. Although surgeons have a variety of data sources available, they are not integrated into a useful 3-D model. A major difficulty in integrating real time data during surgery is compensating for shape changes due to deformability.

The second challenge is to undertake a rigorous mathematical investigation of how and when one can develop efficient indexes; this is referred to as a Theory of Indexability. Indexability theory is akin to complexity theory, which has guided software developers in understanding how and when one can develop efficient algorithms. The main distinction is that indexability focuses on space\/time tradeoffs for indexes, and on the fundamental secondary-storage challenges involved in database indexing. Execution of this research agenda will produce a framework in which data domain experts (e.g., biologists, chemists, earth scientists, computer multimedia researchers, etc.) can (1) identify whether their workloads are indexable, and (2) if so, easily develop efficient indexes for their workloads, integrating these indexes with minimal effort into Object-Relational database management systems.

This method has recently been applied to address the problem of multivariate polynomial resultants. Initial successes include finding determinental formulae for some sparse resultants. The method of moving surfaces produces expressions that are more compact than previous ones, and unlike previous determinental formulae do not contain extraneous factors. Multivariate resultants provide a powerful computational tool for solving problems involving polynomial equations in several variables. While Groebner bases can also be used to solve systems of polynomial equations (as well as answer additional questions about polynomial systems), multivariate resultants are generally more efficient at eliminating variables than Groebner bases. Preliminary examples suggest that the method of moving surfaces might be even more efficient than current multivariate resultant techniques. The method of moving surfaces can be used to attack a wide variety of problems in elimination theory including: 1. constructing multivariate resultants without extraneous factors 2. building sparse resultants 3. implicitizing rational curves and surfaces 4. developing inversion formulas for rational curves and surfaces 5. intersecting rational curves and surfaces 6. intersecting algebraic curves and surfaces. The method of moving curves has already lead to a new classification scheme for rational curves; a similar scheme for rational surfaces will be investigated. While rigorous theoretical foundation for the method of moving curves based on ideal theory has been developed, the method of moving surfaces is currently substantiated only by several Mathematica examples and a few preliminary theorems. Thus the theoretical foundation is far from complete. For example, the method provides an algorithm for determining the rows of a matrix whose determinant is a sparse resultant if it does not vanish.

The method has thus far been applied to eliminating one variable from two polynomials, or two variables from three polynomials.

Duke University Challenges in CISE: TUNE: System Support for Memory-Friendly Programming The pervasive use of multi-level memory hierarchies in microprocessor-based machines makes the performance of an application primarily determined by and extremely sensitive to its memory mapping, and requires memory-friendly programming: careful layout of data structures and restructuring of code to improve data locality. Techniques for improving memory system performance manifest themselves at various levels, from high-level algorithms and data structures, through compile-time analysis and restructuring of programs, to special architectural primitives that allow an application to better manage the memory hierarchy. The lack of automatic tools for improving data locality currently forces many application programmers to manually restructure their codes. Unfortunately, the sophisticated algorithms seen in modern scientific computing require equally sophisticated restructuring techniques. These techniques require expertise in computer architecture, burden the programmer with tedious machine-specific details unrelated to program correctness, and reduce the readability, maintainability, and portability of the restructured code. For all these reasons, manual restructuring of programs of any significant size is untenable, and some kind of system support is necessary. This project targets all aspects of this problem, from developing the relevant mathematical techniques for representing and manipulating data locality, through implementing interactive and automatic data locality management tools, to proposing innovative memory architectures for future-generation systems. The efficacy of the resulting system will be demonstrated using programs representative of modern scientific computations including divide-and-conquer scientific computations such as N-body solvers (e.g., fastmultipole) and many linear algebra kernels (e.g., Strassens's matrix multiplication algo rithm).","title":"Challenges in CISE: TUNE: System Support for Memory-Friendly Programming","awardID":"9726370","effectiveDate":"1997-09-15","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2890","name":"CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0702","name":"Division of CHEM, BIOENG, ENV, &  TRANSP S","abbr":"CBET"},"pgm":{"id":"4725","name":"EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS\/CADRE"}}],"PIcoPI":["451391","530834","402271","555929"],"PO":["301532"]},"23054":{"abstract":"The objective of this research is to develop high level conceptual modeling and usage features in Object-Oriented Database Management Systems (OODBMSs) to improve data analysis and querying.

North Carolina State University Learning and Intelligent Systems: Animated Pedagogical Agent for Constructivist Learning Environments Constructivist learning environments facilitate discovery-based learning through creative problem-solving experiences.

Channels with memory are important in mobile wireless communication where they model random disturbances and distortions that vary in time due to the relative motion between the end-users and the dominant scatterers. In many applications the fast variations in the channel law are impossible to track, so that the encoding at the transmitter and the decoding at the receiver must be performed under channel law uncertainty. For this scenario Feder and Lapidoth have recently demonstrated the existence of a universal decoder. A universal decoder can be designed without knowing the channel in use, and yet it performs asymptotically as well as the optimal maximum-likelihood receiver tuned to the channel in use. The implementation of the universal decoder proposed by Feder and Lapidoth is, however, too complex, and in the proposed study a more efficient universal decoder will be sought. The issue of the transmitter design will be also addressed, and particularly the problem of designing error correcting codes that perform well on any channel in some family. Such codes should perform uniformly well and should lend themselves to universal decoding. The above problems relate to an additional problem that will be studied, namely the calculation of the compound channel capacity of a family of channels with memory. This capacity is the highest rate at which reliable communication can be guaranteed irrespective of which channel in the family is in use. This capacity is thus the ultimate bound on reliable communication when both transmitter and receiver are ignorant of the channel in use. Extension to the multiple-access channel, which models many-to-one communication (as in the reverse link from mobile subscribers to the base station in cellular telephony and in personal communications (PCS)), will be also considered. While the above problems are asymptotic in nature, a non-asymptotic analysis of the bit-error-rate that results when a convolutional code is decoded using a Viterbi decoder tuned to the wrong channel law is also proposed. This research is part of a five year career plan encompassing both teaching and research in information theory. The proposed research aims at bridging the gap between information theory and practical wireless communications and at simplifying some of the key ideas of information theory. Such simplifications will be used in order to supplement the electrical engineering and computer science undergraduate curriculum by introducing the notions of entropy, source coding, and channel coding early in a student's program.

Traditional database secondary storage indexing techniques such as B-trees and hash tables are not suitable for dealing with multidimensional data, as data access is performed by concentrating on only one-dimension at a time and large quantities of extraneous data may be retrieved. The main goal of this project is to explore and develop techniques for efficient loading, retrieval, and update of large disk-resident multidimensional data for both single machine and parallel machine architectures. Storage and processing of both point and region data are considered. The database community has independently developed a number of disk-based multi-dimensional indexing schemes, without applying results from relevant fields that may significantly improve loading and retrieval performance. Accordingly, the approach used in this project is firmly grounded within the realm of computational geometry, a discipline that has produced numerous techniques for the efficient processing of memory-resident multidimensional data. The generalization and improvement of these techniques to handle efficiently disk-resident data is an important part of this research. Additionally, the use of parallelism to provide improved load and query response times for very large data sets is also considered. The resulting indexing techniques will enable higher level database architectures to provide efficient access to the very large multi-dimensional datasets of the future, thus enabling database technology to keep up with demands placed upon it from science and business as a whole.","title":"Geometric Techniques for Multidimensional Databases","awardID":"9610270","effectiveDate":"1997-09-15","expirationDate":"2001-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}}],"PIcoPI":["158664","315564"],"PO":["563751"]},"21382":{"abstract":"ECS-9707111 Boyd Powerful new methods for various convex matrix optimization problems have emerged over the last few years. Most of this research has concentrated on the semidefinite programming problem (SDP), i. e., the problem of minimizing a linear cost function over linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). SDPs are convex optimization problems that can be solved with great efficiency using recently developed interior-point algorithms. These matrix optimization methods have had immediate practical and theoretical impact in several fields, notably control systems and combinatorial optimization. In control theory, the basic idea is to formulate the analysis or synthesis problem in terms of convex matrix optimization problems, which are then solved numerically. The current state of research on LMIs in control can be summarized: There has been intensive research on identifying control problems that can be cast in terms of LMIS, and those for which an LM1 formulation is unlikely to exist. In the latter case, bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIS) have been recognized as a unifying form. The combined activity in mathematical programming and control theory has led to very rapid progress in interior-point algorithms for solving SDPS, focusing on local convergence rates, worst-case complexity, etc., and on extending to SDP the sophisticated and efficient primal-dual interior-point methods developed for linear programming (LP). Several basic software implementations of interior-point methods for SDP have become available. These codes have proven useful for small to medium-sized problems, but tend to be too slow for larger problems, since they exploit little or no problem structure. LMls are becoming basic tools in control, much the way Riccati equations became basic tools in the 1960s. Thus, LMI\/SDP solvers are becoming part of the infrastructure of control (computation and practice), just as Riccati equation solvers are now. The same techniques can be applied in several other fields. In statistical signal processing, for example, SDP allows one to define optimization problems that involve representation and decomposition of covariance matrices. Here many challenges are still to be found in the problem formulation area (i.e., identifying statistical signal processing problems that can be cast in this framework) but it is already clear that the approach will be rewarding. Perhaps even more than in control, practical use of matrix optimization in statistics will require efficient algorithms for large-scale problems. This proposal brings together researchers in the three key areas involved: control theory, statistics, and large-scale numerical optimization, in order to address the next logical areas of research: identification of the problems in statistical signal processing that can be formulated in terms of LMIS, and the development of more powerful algorithms (and practical codes) for the matrix optimization problems that arise in control and statistical signal processing. The research effort will be complemented with a strong educational component, by integrating the effort with the newly developed course Convex Optimization with Engineering Applications. We will transition new research results in statistical signal processing directly into the course material, which will help broaden the range of applications presented in the course. The new research on numerical methods will enter the course in two important ways: first, as an advanced topic on implementation (missing from the current course), and second, by providing tools that students can use during the course, especially in projects. Another important (but less direct) educational goal is to train two PhD students in a completely interdisciplinary fashion, equipping them with skills that range from, say, robust control theory or statistics, to optimization theory and implementation of large-scale numerical algorithms. As the power of computing continues its exponential rise, researchers with this background will be increasingly valuable.","title":"Methods for Matrix Optimization Problems in Control and Statistical Signal Processing","awardID":"9707111","effectiveDate":"1997-09-15","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0504","name":"Division of MICROELECTRONIC INFOR PROCESS","abbr":"MIP"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0701","name":"Division of ELECTRICAL, COMMUN & CYBER SYS","abbr":"ECCS"},"pgm":{"id":"1518","name":"CONTROL, NETWORKS, & COMP INTE"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0701","name":"Division of ELECTRICAL, COMMUN & CYBER SYS","abbr":"ECCS"},"pgm":{"id":"5514","name":"OPERATIONS RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["403485","491111","526394"],"PO":["564728"]},"21163":{"abstract":"The goal of the project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a broad-based language for scientific and engineering computation.

Most of the time, such approximations are performed by elementary procedures with no mathematical sophistication, with the result that the calculations become enormous. The goal of this project is to build a toolbox for solving dynamical systems, specifically targeted to perturbation methods for Hamiltonian systems. The toolbox will be flexible enough to treat efficiently different classes of systems will allow researchers to explore new problems, experiment with new transformations, and verify published results. As a demonstration of usefulness, flexibility and efficiency, an analytical theory will be developed for lunar satellites at low altitude. Planners for lunar survey missions, such as the Clementine mission in 1994, seek orbits appropriate for reconnaissance. They need to predict the long-term behavior of a satellite in order to select an orbit with low eccentricity (for constant sensor altitude) and fixed pericenter (to economize fuel in maneuvers). At present, orbit selection is largely a matter of guesswork. Using crude approximations, planners choose possible orbits which are then checked by numerical integration. Without a global view of the long-term dynamics, mission planners can only hope they sampled wisely. Generating ``maps'' of long-term phase space from an analytical model will remove the guesswork.

In particular, the design of a good representation suitable to model large numbers of generic objects that is also robust to occlusion and segmentation problems, has been an stumbling block in achieving success. In this research, a new representation using appearance-based parts (ABPs) and relationships (ABRs) is proposed to overcome these problems. ABPs and ABRs are defined in terms of closed regions, segmented using the Minimum Description Length principle, whose appearance is obtained from collections of images and compactly stored in a hierarchical structure of parametric eigenspaces. This new representation allows the representation of free form objects and has several appealing features, namely (1) robustness to segmentation problems, since it is learned from segmented images; (2) robustness to occlusion steming from the fact that it is based on parts rather than on global properties; and (3) ability to handle large object databases, due to its hierarchical nature. As part of this research a probabilistic model of the discriminatory power of the proposed representation will be also developed. This model will be used in a Bayesian framework, based on the PI's previous work, to design a recognition system. The new representation and the associated probabilistic model, coupled with a Bayesian reasoning engine, will enable the system to automatically recognize and locate generic objects in cluttered scenes. The main contributions of this research are: (1) a new object representation capable of representing large databases of generic objects that is also robust to segmentation problems and occlusion; (2) a probabilistic model of the discriminatory power of the proposed representation and a recognition system based on a Bayesian framework that does not require the use o f ad hoc heuristics; and (3) a rigorous experimental protocol to characterize the performance of the system in the presence of occlusion.","title":"Object Recognition in Cluttered Scenes Using Appearance-Based Parts and Relationships","awardID":"9712598","effectiveDate":"1997-09-15","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["549740"],"PO":["179262"]},"23088":{"abstract":"This research investigates computer support for learning, working, and collaborating.

Most human beings have the ability to close their eyes while in a room with a half dozen people talking and separate out the various strands of conversation while physically localizing the speakers. This is something computers cannot yet do: it is easy to scatter a half dozen microphones about a table around which many people are speaking, but standard algorithms cannot use the signals from those microphones to separate, localize, and track the speakers. This project is exploring algorithms to perform simultaneous acoustic source separation, localization, and deconvolution, using modular architectures. Different modules encapsulate different pieces of knowledge: what the acoustics of a room can do to a sound, what human speech sounds like, what it means for sources to be separated, how sources tend to move about in space. The knowledge is combined in probabilistic framework, yielding estimates of the separated source waveforms and physical locations. These algorithms have the potential to improve devices like speaker phones, cellular telephones, stereos, computer speech recognition systems, burglar alarms, and hearing aids.","title":"CAREER: Bayesian Source Separation and Localization Using Modular Neural Networks","awardID":"9702311","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-10-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6845","name":"HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6856","name":"ARTIFICIAL INTELL & COGNIT SCI"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0701","name":"Division of ELECTRICAL, COMMUN & CYBER SYS","abbr":"ECCS"},"pgm":{"id":"1518","name":"CONTROL, NETWORKS, & COMP INTE"}}],"PIcoPI":[50284],"PO":["564456"]},"24991":{"abstract":"CDA-9724613 Bansil, Arun Northeastern University Acquisition of a High-Performance Computation\/Visualization Laboratory for Scientific Research Northeastern University is acquiring a symmetric multiprocessor, a network of workstations, and a cluster of high-performance graphics workstations to support scientific visualizations, the execution of medium scale science and engineering computations, and the development of scalable codes using standard programming languages and tools.

They are suitable for applications that require multiple locomotion gaits over different types of terrain, or that combine mobility with flexible manipulation in ways that could not be anticipated at the time of initial design of a conventional robot. The focus of this work is task-directed self-reconfiguration, with an emphasis on robots that can self-organize to support multiple locomotion gaits and on robots that can sequence locomotion and manipulation gaits. This research will explore several designs for self- reconfigurable modules. The potential of each design will be evaluated by geometrically characterizing the class of three- dimensional robotic structures that can be built with it. This research will also consider control and planning approaches to self-reconfiguration. For each module design, control and coordination algorithms will be developed and evaluated.

The packages are generically programmed as C++ template classes with abstract underlying arithmetics; they can be compiled with a variety of fast libraries for the basic field, floating point, and polynomial operations. A server\/client interface seamlessly attaches the packages to all widely-used general purpose symbolic systems such as Maple and Mathetmatica. Parallel execution of the implemented algorithms will be facilitated. Black box objects are stored as functions. For instance: a black box polynomial is a procedure that takes values for the variables as input and evaluates the polynomial at that given point; a black box matrix is a procedure that takes an arbitrary vector as input and computes the matrix times vector product. The FoxBox system is a package for computing greatest common divisors and factoring black box polynomials. The aim is to eliminate algorithmic bottlenecks in FoxBox and add black box linear algebra. For sake of speed, the project focuses on algorithms over finite fields. Efficient server\/client bridge code to a variety of general purpose systems will be developed.

The allowance of floating point coefficients in a symbolic, i.e., parameterized model, is crucial for a symbolic approach to problems from the physical world. Moreover, floating point arithmetic is faster than exact arithmetic, especially for algebraic numbers. Several numerical models, such as a-posteriori iterative improvement and sensitivity analysis for perturbed input data, will be considered.

An interactionist perspective leads to a computational model in which the earliest knowledge structures are influenced by both native structure in the agent and its exposure to the world. `Physical schemas` are learned that form stable, dynamical relationships between the agent and the world based on closed-loop `physical primitives.` A preimaging technique is used to form context-dependent categories spontaneously in order to improve the quality of sensory and motor behavior. Declarative models are lifted from the sensorimotor substrate in the form of `figurative schema.` This representation includes explicit predictive models of sensation and affect, and thus captures some of the underlying semantics of behavioral policies. An integrated robot system is used as the experimental platform. The implications of this work extend to developmental psychology, epistemology, and psycholinguistics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Computational agents built on these principles refer ultimately to the physical world for meaning --- the same physical world that shapes human conceptual structure.

The world's telephone companies are well on their way to total conversion to ATM which is expected to take about 25 years. Utilizing a small 53-byte cell structure, ATM enables effective communication between a large variety of broadband technologies that are currently evolving. Accordingly, there is strong interest in formulating a switching architecture suitable for ATM-based wide area network, for which several studies can be found in the literature. Often, these studies reported specific switching architectures along with performance data such as throughput and delay, but little in the way to indicate their effectiveness as large, wide area switches. This project entails comprehensive investigation in developing a framework for wide area ATM switching. Based on the extensive experiences derived from our recent prototyping effort for the Washington University Multi-Channel Switch (WUMCS), we incorporate several important technological constraints in the investigation of the characteristics of wide area switches, such as scalability, synchronization, high performance, fault tolerance, fairness, and modularity. Use of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) is necessary in order to provide the extremely high clocking and data transfer rates needed in wide area switches. The number of integrated circuit (IC) chips in a switch translates directly to the cost and implementation complexity. We attempt to minimize the IC count in the switch by implementing each switch module with the maximum possible throughput in a single IC. Significant effort is devoted to the investigation of various options in the design of switch modules that result in the maximum possible throughput, while taking into consideration constraints associated with VLSI such as die size, electrical propagation delay, power dissipation, and pin limitation. An important goal of the proposed work is to determine the VLSI chip limi ts of various switching architectures in terms of maximum throughput, maximum number of input\/output channels, and maximum achievable channel speed, when implemented in a single IC. Since any realistic wide area switch requires throughput that is not achievable in a single IC, we investigate methodologies of scaling up the switch by interconnecting switch modules. We explicate the benefits to a wide area switch of integrating multi-channel switching which balances loads across the switch modules in a switch. In the project , we develop switch architectures which are optimized for VLSI implementation, and conduct comprehensive analytical studies on their efficacy under varying traffic and network conditions. In addition, there will be a significant amount of implementation. The proposed implementation work will comprise of: * Design and development of switch ICs * System board construction * Software controller development * Demonstration testbed development The first part of the implementation work will be the definition of the functional requirements for the switching system, followed by the design specifications for the switch ICs and the software controller. IC design will be the first actual electronic design step. We will most likely employ a schematic capture process for the IC design, utilizing VHDL mostly for the functional and logical verification. We will utilize a conservative CMOS technology from a reputable foundry. The estimated IC size for switch module is 150 square milli meters, and the IC will require about 350 pins and consume 1.5 watts. We expect that the system board will be 12 inches by 16 inches in dimension, implement the line interface, timing, switching, and header translation functions for 10 giga bits per second throughput. By the conclusion of this project, we expect to have created a promising methodology for guiding the development of wide area ATM switches. Our overall goal is to suggest methods to alleviate the size and speed l imitation of current electronic switches by proposing scalable and simple-to-implement architectures that can support very high bandwidth and a variety of traffic types seen in wide area networks. Given the growing deployment of ATM in local area networks and the increased interest in using it in wide area networks, we believe that the proposed work is very timely and can serve to establish a framework for future work to follow.

Hierarchical Bayesian models are developed for each problem with an emphasis on common features. The techniques used to compute posterior probabilities from these models are Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.

Classification and segmentation can be used to assist human users of images, as in highlighting suspicious tissue in a medical image or defects in an imaged circuit, or they can be used for the automatic extraction of features in intelligent browsing of large databases. All three operations have in common the goal of efficiently representing an image as a whole, by optimally trading off quality and cost or distortion, an din decomposing the image into useful components.

The intelligent PCS network will be required to provide channel access with a minimum of call blocking, negotiate quality of service, allocate resources, and track users throughout their sessions. It is proposed to develop a series of expert systems that will optimize random access, resource allocation, and mobility management protocols. These expert systems will use a number of technologies and techniques from the fields of neural networks, artificial intelligence, and knowledge representation. There are three levels of agents in the proposed intelligent PCS network: mobile user, Base Station Controller (BSC), and the Mobile Switching Center (MSC). It is assumed that the PCS system is cellular, with several BSC's interacting with a single MSC. It is proposed to determine a means for representing and exploiting the information available to each type of agent. At the physical layer, in-band transmitted power levels will be tracked by a grid of low-cost sensors (radiometers). The sensors will provide power measurements as a function of time and location. In the proposal it is shown that this information can be used in the development of a BSC-based intelligent ALOHA multiple access scheme. Neural networks are described that can efficiently use the sensor data to estimate the number of users involved in individual collision events. This information is used in turn to estimate the number of backlogged users and to select an optimal backoff algorithm, thus maximizing Aloha channel throughput. The sensor grid can also be used by the BSC and MSC to support resource allocation, handoffs, and the tracking of scheduled user transmissions. In the proposed research program, sensor-based expert systems will be developed for three distinct phases of PCS operation: system planning and layout, multiple access, and adaptive resource allocation. Higher level information can be acquired and used at the BSC's and the MSC. The BSC's will obtain information regarding the local users' bandwidth and quality of service requirements as a function of time. The BSC's will also track local channel conditions, and develop a detailed propagation model for the cell. The model will be used to as an aid to power control within the cell. The BSC is expected to act as an autonomous agent in local resource allocation and power control. The MSC will be responsible for allocating resources between cells. An allocation protocol will be developed to move resources between cells in response to traffic information acquired by the BSC's and passed to the MSC. The BSC's will also pass propagation and user tracking information to the MSC. The MSC will use this information to create a global propagation and user tracking model that will support the handoff decision process. An effort will be made to develop usage tendency profiles for individual users. The collection of user profiles will be used to develop models for global resource allocation.","title":"Predictive, Sensor-Assisted Wireless Multimedia Systems","awardID":"9725251","effectiveDate":"1997-09-15","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["204732","450625","516488"],"PO":["194325"]},"38765":{"abstract":"","title":"CAREER: Structural Properties and Irrelevant Attributes: Implications for Learning and Complexity","awardID":"9896085","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"1999-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["518057"],"PO":["150516"]},"25587":{"abstract":"9726389 Goldberg, Kenneth University of California-Berkeley Challenges in CISE: Planning and Control for Massively Parallel Manipulation Increased miniaturization of mass-produced products such as disk drives, displays, and sensors requires fundamental innovations in design and parts handling.

The idea is to move parts using planar forces and moments that require a minimum of sensing and servoing. The shape of the field, as defined by the magnitude and direction of the force at each point, can be designed to position, align, sort, and assemble arrays of small parts in parallel. Planar force fields have enormous potential for precise parallel assembly of small parts. The goal of the research is to develop an entirely new methodology for precision part manipulation and to demonstrate it with new theory, algorithms, and high-performance devices. This research has the potential to parallelize the manufacture of a new generation of consumer and industrial products.","title":"Challenges in CISE: Planning and Control for Massively Parallel Manipulation","awardID":"9726389","effectiveDate":"1997-09-15","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"01","name":"Office of OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR                  ","abbr":"O\/D"},"div":{"id":"0111","name":"Office of CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"OCI"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2890","name":"CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES"}}],"PIcoPI":["409023","520937"],"PO":["301532"]},"23057":{"abstract":"A critical issue in recognizing 3D objects and in registering surfaces is the definition of a ound measure of similarity between 3D shapes. Although shape similarity metrics have been proposed in the case of 2D shapes, only partial results have been obtained for 3D shapes. Part of the problem is that it is difficult to define the necessary pose-independent reference frame on a 3D surface. This research investigates representations of 3D shapes that lead to a natural definition of shape similarity that can be built directly from point sets without requiring feature extraction, segmentation, or surface fitting. These representations may be adjusted to be either a global representation of a surface (e.g., for object recognition) or a more local representation (e.g., for tracking of local surface patches.) They lead naturally to 3D shape matching algorithms directly applicable to object recognition problems. Beyond their application to 3D object recognition, these representations will provide a framework for the analysis of 3D shapes. Of particular interest is the study of shape classes and generic object recognition. The shape representations and the associated matching algorithms are validated through scenarios motivated by real applications. In one application, object recognition is used for building and identifying geometric models of industrial parts. In a second application, the shape similarity technique is used for registering views of terrain and landmark surfaces in a natural environment for mobile robot navigation and mapping.","title":"Point-Based Surface Representation for Shape Similarity and Object Recognition","awardID":"9711853","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["520920"],"PO":["475621"]},"23178":{"abstract":"Integration of multiple Internet sources poses many novel challenges such as handling semistructured data, creating views without complete knowledge of the source structure, adapting to the limited query interfaces (capabilities) of the sources, and answering queries referring to virtual objects which are the result of complex information fusion operations. Recent works have provided flexible, though very often inefficient, ways to rapidly develop mediators that achieve the above goals. This research develops data structures, algorithms and systems which can enhance the performance, often by orders of magnitude, and improve the user interface without compromising the development flexibility. Data guides are proposed for describing the concepts (or combinations of concepts) that significantly appear in each source and in the integrated view created by the mediator. Data guide computation algorithms use (1) the mediator specification, (2) the parser of the source data, and (3) actual data of query results. Mediators and user interfaces are extended to make use of the data guides upon query processing and query formulation. This research also develops algorithms that (1) further extend the mediator's ability to adapt to the limited capabilities of the sources, (2) use knowledge (e.g., dependencies) of the source data to enhance the performance of object fusion queries, and (3) optimize the delivery of partial answers. This research will demonstrate how flexible integration systems (such as systems for constructing virtual malls by integrating multiple Web shopping sites or systems for fusing all available financial information relating to a company) can be rapidly developed while still achieving the performance of hard-to-built custom made integration systems.","title":"Integration of Information from Internet Sources","awardID":"9712239","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6845","name":"HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6857","name":"DIGITAL LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES"}}],"PIcoPI":["525612"],"PO":["563751"]},"24047":{"abstract":"9720170 Landau, David P.

The performance gains that can be achieved by using observations taken at multiple sensors are well known. However, generally is too costly to transmit all the data generated by each sensor to some central location to use in making a signal detection decision. It is therefore of great interest to study distributed detection schemes, which provide acceptable performance while requiring only limited transmissions. Research on distributed signal detection schemes for cases with dependent observations has been lacking. The goal of this project is to develop the foundation of a theory for understanding distributed detection schemes for cases with dependent observations from sensor to sensor. The theory will predict when the optimum distributed processing schemes will be different from the optimum isolated sensor processing schemes. The theory will also explain why this occurs. The approach draws heavily on weak-signal results we have already developed and on recent preliminary results. Specifically, we are attempting to represent the optimum sensor processing in terms of known functions and unknown constants, as we have done in the weak signal cases. Using such a representation should allow one to determine when the optimum isolated sensor processings will be optimum and to explain why the optimum isolated sensor processings are not optimum in some cases. While the focus is on developing much needed theory, the results will be immediately useful in many applications. Furthermore, some emphasis is being devoted to developing design algorithms and to the study of nonparametric distributed detection schemes for cases with uncertain statistical models. Such studies will produce tools and techniques for pressing practical problems.","title":"A General Theory for Distributed Signal Detection","awardID":"9703730","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["380971"],"PO":["564898"]},"20186":{"abstract":"This project deals with the compression of information for efficient transmission and storage. The information can be of the most general kind, but the approach here takes into account the redundancy in the data which expresses itself as a spectral distribution .

In this scheme, the spectral characteristics as well as the characteristics of the signal, which pertain to the human perceptive systems such as the hearing or visual system, can be exploited. We are addressing several fundamental issues in the design and implementation of subband codes. The optimization of orthonormal as well as biorthogonal subband coders is being considered in this project. We are also addressing the cases of nonuniform subband coders, which are most appropriate for the case of audio and image coding; and the theory of sampling and reconstruction of non bandlimited signals, showing how such a theory can be exploited in quantization and compression of data. This aspect of the research generalizes the family of oversampled analog- to-digital converters to the case of non bandlimited signals. Another topic under investigation is a special class of subband coders called cyclic coders, which are potentially capable of greater coding efficiency. This class is especially useful for the compression of short blocks of independent data.","title":"Optimization Issues in Digital Filter Banks","awardID":"9703755","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["321961"],"PO":["564898"]},"23234":{"abstract":"This project concerns equational reasoning, with emphasis on word and unification problems.

The approach to word problems will use the rewriting paradigm, concentrating on procedures and data structures for computing complete\/canonical sets of rewrite rules. In particular, the method using SOUR graphs for completing rewrite systems will be investigated, particularly the way in which SOUR Graphs can be used to develop procedures for solving the word problem in certain classes of theories. The first part of the research will be to examine the procedure in its simplest form, on string rewriting systems. Once methods are developed to solve the word problem in its simplest form, those methods will be moved back into pure equational logic, and finally into full first order equational logic. For ground equational theories, the plan is to investigate techniques for computing congruence closures based on the rewriting paradigm developed in studying Shostak's congruence closure method. Applications to combinations of decision procedures will be investigated. The relationship between the congruence closure method and SOUR graphs will be investigated and exploited. In unification, the concentration is on semantic unification, where some of the function symbols have semantics associated with them, usually specified in the form of an equational theory.

This research develops a novel way of summarizing and indexing images and other pictorial data based on their appearance, and more specifically on their color, shape, and texture content. These descriptors, called image signatures, are uniform, compact, flexible, robust, and intuitive. The notion of the Earth-Mover's Distance between signatures is introduced and used to give a metric structure to the image space. This metric structure, together with additional geometric information, is then exploited to provide efficient nearest-neighbor search algorithms, as well as to compute distance-preserving embeddings of the image space, or portions thereof, into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Such embeddings, obtained using multi-dimensional scaling, allow the user to visualize intuitively both local image neighborhoods of interest, or the entire image space at once. The user is able to navigate around the image space intuitively, with a sense of continuity and comprehensiveness, unlike current systems which typically present fragments of the data-base in a disconnected fashion.

Each language in the family is distinguished by the domain of values for the program variables. Prolog is the best-known language in the family and can be viewed as CLP in the domain of infinite trees. This research focuses on CLP over a real-number domain (CLP(R)). Implementations of CLP(R) generally restrict constraints to linear equations and inequalities, and the resulting languages have proven expressive enough for a variety of scheduling, warehouse location, cutting stock, options trading, and crew rostering problems, as well as AI puzzles. However, CLP(R)'s usefulness is limited by the large search space required for most problems and by the complexity of the constraint satisfaction algorithm. Stated more simply, it is not always possible to benefit from CLP's expressiveness, since many useful problems take too long to solve. The goal of this research is to identify CLP(R) applications that would be feasible if execution could be sped up, and to find ways to cut down on execution time through a more efficient constraint satisfaction algorithm. ***","title":"Applications and Efficient Execution of Constraint Logic Programming Over a Real-Number Domain","awardID":"9619523","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}}],"PIcoPI":["552411"],"PO":["150697"]},"25489":{"abstract":"9726118 Harrington, James Eason, Reginald NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Special Project: 7th Annual MU-SPIN Conference (1996) and Supplemental Support for on-campus Regional Training Workshop This interagency transfer purpose is to partially support a large conference and supplemental smaller workshops on high performance computing and communications and infrastructure development for minority institutions.

Image and video processing systems are difficult to design because they consist of a variety of algorithms implemented by a variety of electronic devices and software programs. In industry, it is common practice to divide the design of an image or video processing system into simpler parts and design the parts separately. Until all of the individual parts are designed and built, it is difficult to guarantee that the parts will work together, and know how the decisions in the design of an individual part will affect the cost and quality of the entire system. As an alternative, this research explores design techniques and computer tools that allow all the parts of an image and video processing system to be designed at the same time. The principal investigator is establishing a research and education program in the design and implementation of image and video processing systems. The research focuses on automating the design of scalable software and hardware for image and video processing systems. The performance of a scalable implementation improves as more processors are allocated to the task, until the number of processors reaches upper limit. Scalable hardware can expand to a variable number of processors, whereas scalable software adapts to the processors that are available. Scalable software is available on desktop computers, and scalable hardware is commonly used in high-performance computing. The education program trains undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art design methods and technologies. As part of this training, the investigator is introducing new courses in communication system design, image and video processing, and embedded software systems.

Distributed deduction couples the traditional aim of making computation faster by parallelization, with the aim of investigating new forms of automated reasoning, that may arise from the combination of deductive computing and distributed computing. The research will consider the coarse-grain parallelization of contraction- based strategies, that are among the most successful strategies available, especially on equational problems. The objective is to design new techniques to subdivide a theorem-proving problem among concurrent deductive processes, in such a way that each of them has less work than a sequential process, and a proof may be found faster. This part of the work will consist in the definition and implementation of distributed strategies with these features. Theorem-proving strategies are evaluated usually by testing their implementations. The long-term goal of the theoretical part of this research is to make possible some complexity analysis of theorem-proving strategies prior to implementation, so that useful features may be recognized sooner. Recent work by the proponent shows that progress in this direction is feasible. This project will develop a methodology of analysis, that covers both forward reasoning and backward reasoning, sequential and parallel strategies. As part of the project the methodology will be applied to analyze selected features of strategies, such as contraction, lemmaizing\/caching and forms of parallel search. The two parts of the project are deeply connected, because the methodology for strategy analysis is based on a model of the search space and search process, which is used also as a fundamental tool of analysis to achieve the objectives in distributed deduction. The educational component of this project comprises two objectives in course development. The first one is the evolution of an undergraduate cour se in programming language concepts into a course where the concepts are learnt in functional and logic programming. The purpose is to offer to the students some exposure to paradigms that are underrepresented in the curriculum. This is important, since long-lasting programming maturity requires the flexibility fostered by the practice of multiple paradigms. The second one is the development of a graduate course in artificial intelligence. It will be a course in logical methods for artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on fully automated deduction. The students will acquire a solid understanding of some of the most important concepts in the logical foundations of computer science, together with the preparation for seminars or research projects in deduction. Both lectures and assignments will emphasize the practical consequences of the theory, and students will conduct experiments with state-of-the-art theorem provers.","title":"CAREER: Distributed Deduction with Contraction and Foundation of Strategy Analysis","awardID":"9701508","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2890","name":"CISE RESEARCH RESOURCES"}}],"PIcoPI":[49815],"PO":["179846"]},"20550":{"abstract":"9704703 Ryder, Barbara G. Rutgers University CISE Postdoctoral Research Associates in Experimental CS :Data-Flow Testing for Difficult-to-Find Bugs Data-flow coverage criteria are heuristics for judging the quality of software test suites and determining when enough testing has been done. The analysis required for data-flow testing of programs in languages such as C is currently impractical on large programs. Achieving near 100% satisfaction of the coverage requirements constitutes the real expense of data-flow testing. However, this is not necessarily related to the real expense of testing, which is looking for the difficult-to-find bugs. With the hypothesis that difficult-to-find bugs are correlated with statement hazard level, statement hazard is introduced to measure the unexpected effects of executing a program statement. Preliminary experiments indicate that a small proportion of program statements are highly hazardous. Hazard of a side-effect is defined as the degree to which its side-effects are unexpected by the programmer. Thus, experiments to determine the relation between hazardous statements and bug detection are described. These experiments build on other successful experiments in analyzing data-flow testing effectiveness, but additionally pay special attention to those bugs that are difficult to find. Determining the correlation between hazardous statements and difficult-to-find bugs will improve the effectiveness of data-flow testing and reduce its cost, making data-flow testing feasible in an industrial environment.","title":"Postdoc: Data-Flow Testing for Difficult-To-Find Bugs","awardID":"9704703","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"1999-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["438877"],"PO":["297837"]},"20121":{"abstract":"MESSENGERS is a distributed programming system based on the principles of self-migrating threads, which carry their own identity and behavior in the form of programs.

These applications have important uses in a wide range of activities from education and health care to entertainment. Their full deployment will clearly have a huge impact on the quality of our lives and the society as a whole. Such applications, however, are very bandwidth demanding, very sensitive to congestion, and require real-time and reliable communication. Although appropriate protocols, such as the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol and an enhanced version of Internet's TCP\/IP protocol (with RSVP), already exist, Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning remains one of the fundamental open problems that need to be addressed before real-time applications can be reliably supported. If congestion is not an option, restricting the number of users that are allowed in the network becomes an extremely useful tool in guaranteeing QoS. The central goal of this research is to devise such an admission control procedure and test its performance in practice. To provide QoS guarantees the network should prevent congestion which causes packet losses due to buffer overflows and excessive delays. A worst case based admission control algorithm (which allocates to calls bandwidth equal to their peak rate) leads to significant underutilization of the network resources, since traffic is typically bursty, i.e., the peak rate is not sustained for long. To achieve more efficient use of the resources the proposed approach will permit some congestion phenomena which will be occurring infrequently enough to allow for the provision of statistical QoS guarantees. More specifically, it is desired to operate the network in a regime where loss probabilities and probabilities of excessive delays are particularly small (e.g., on the order of 10^{-6}). Real-time app lications can tolerate such small frequencies of congestion phenomena. This research will draw upon methods developed in applied probability, optimization, and optimal control theory, and will use, extending whenever necessary, many of the ideas developed recently by the PI. Calculating congestion probabilities for non-trivial traffic models is particularly hard. The proposed work will therefore resort to asymptotic results using large deviations theory (a subfield of applied probability) as the main analytical tool. Issues that are considered as prerequisites for successful admission control will be first resolved. Among them the proposed research will address: -Traffic Modeling. The aim is to propose models that capture the statistical properties of the traffic which are relevant to admission control. -Performance analysis. The goal is to asymptotically estimate congestion probabilities in a multiclass and multihop network environment. The final product of the proposed work will be an admission control algorithm that provides statistical QoS guarantees to admitted calls and possesses the following characteristics: -Support for multiple service classes. Applications will be bundled in service classes based on the statistical character of the traffic they generate and on their QoS requirements. -Full utilization of available bandwidth. The controller will be flexible enough to investigate different bandwidth allocation strategies among service classes and deny admission only when there is no feasible allocation that guarantees QoS to all connected calls. -End-to-End QoS guarantees.

Most of these systems have chosen to use asynchronous replication schemes in which updates to replicas are not synchronized. Although these schemes perform reasonably well for single object updates (i.e., environments such as file-systems), they are not suitable when a single update involves multiple objects (i.e., transactional environments). This project investigates the benefits of using synchronous and asynchronous broadcast mechanisms for managing replicated databases. Broadcast primitives, viz., reliable broadcast, causal broadcast, and atomic broadcast, will be used to design new protocols for synchronous replication. In synchronous replication, transactions accessing replicated data are synchronized with other transactions in the system.

Query optimizers are one of the main means by which modern database systems achieve their performance advantages. Given a request for data manipulation or retrieval, an optimizer will choose an optimal plan for evaluating the request from among the manifold alternative strategies. Optimization for the basic relational model is considered a solved problem by many. However, new application areas such as knowledge discovery, on-line analytical processing, and complex multimedia objects, have kindled renewed research in optimization. Current optimizers have often proved inadequate to the needs of these new application areas. Researchers have developed optimization techniques, and several prototype optimizers, to support new applications. This research addresses engineering questions related to the use of new optimizers for new applications: which operators to use; which search strategies to employ; and which transforms to utilize. These investigations use the Columbia query optimizer framework and visualization environment developed at PSU and OGI. The project interacts closely with companies which produce database management systems and the hardware on which they run. The research results will help database optimizer implementors make better choices in the design of their systems, leading to better performance and more expressive query languages for commercial database systems.","title":"Collaborative Research: Query Optimization Engineering","awardID":"9619977","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}}],"PIcoPI":["483300"],"PO":["563751"]},"20881":{"abstract":"Error control codes have been extensively used to achieve high reliability in computer and communication systems.

A traditional sequential file model does not allow applications to express the parallel nature of their resource demands, or to exploit the full parallel file system bandwidth. This research proposes new application-level input\/output interfaces to express parallelism that cannot be automatically detected.

The demonstrated benefits of application supplies access pattern information; while file system policy control drive attempts to standardize system and application-level programming interfaces.

In particular, a new architecture for visual information representation is detailed based on the notion of programmable terminals, essentially considering the decoder as a Turing machine. In such a framework, the algorithm becomes itself the content, rather than just being used to process content. The benefits of such an approach are numerous, and can be appreciated by considering the revolutionary benefits derived from the transition of computer usage from the days of simple text terminals for number-crunching mainframes to today's powerful graphical user interfaces that host Web browsers. Computers were initially considered as calculation devices, but are not mostly used to generate elementary forms of algorithmic content, such as windows, menus, icons, fonts, etc., that empower users to perform advanced text document creation, distribution, access, etc. The proposed framework generalizes this paradigm to the case of digital images and video, and allows its use in a wide range of applications. The shift towards algorithmic representations requires both theoretical and applied innovations. From a theoretical standpoint, it is shown that a new mathematical theory can be developed (called Complexity Distortion Theory), providing a universal mathematical framework in which all coding techniques (from traditional entropy coding to model-based video coding) can be appropriately analyzed. This theory builds on the notion of a programmable terminal and promises significant results for real systems that operate under time and space constraints, or when compression is only one of the representation requirements. From a practical, applications-oriented standpoint, this new approach allows the elimination of decades of lag of audio-visual information representation with respect to modern software design. A software-based archi tecture is described, centered around a new programming language paradigm (FLAVOR - Formal Language for Audio-Visual Object Representation), and developed to provide the basis for real, functioning systems. Several applications and application domains are discussed in which the proposed approach can have a fundamental impact, empowering users with seamless creation, manipulation, and access to visual information.","title":"CAREER: Theory, Software Tools, and Applications for Algorithmic Visual Information Representation","awardID":"9703163","effectiveDate":"1997-09-15","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["218124"],"PO":["564898"]},"11488":{"abstract":"The goal of this research project is to design, analyze and simulate restartable algorithms for on-line reorganization in parallel database management systems (DBMSs). The approach includes the description of explicit logging operations to assure consistency and preserve incremental improvements in the face of possible system failures at any site. Each algorithm is carefully detailed to work with standard concurrency and recovery modules in large DBMSs. Most large databases will soon be managed by parallel DBMSs (i.e., DBMSs on clusters of workstations, each managing its own collections of disks, connected by LANs and running the same software), so parallel algorithms are important. Earlier work in a centralized setting, by the Prof. Salzberg and her students Chendong Zou and Allyn Dimock, included algorithms for shrinking sparsely populated B-trees and for moving records (for example, to improve clustering). This project continues this work and expands it to a parallel setting. The project investigates the question of incrementally and lazily updating distributed dictionaries and indexes when records are moved from disks at one site to disks at another. This project represents the only work on on-line reorganization done in an academic setting which considers recovery and logging. Prof. Salzberg collaborates with Svein-Olaf Hvasshovd and Svein-Eric Bratsberg of Telenor Research (Norway's telephone company) using the parallel DBMS ClustRa as a testbed for the algorithmic work.

Algorithms that determine the order in which users are to be equalized and decoded will be obtained, error propagation effects for multiuser decision feedback detection will be quantified, and a characterization of error exponents for decision feedback receivers for coded systems will be sought.

In order to study the aforementioned issues, an accurate characterization of compressed video traffic is required. Accordingly, we will first capture, digitize, and compress (via compression standards) several video streams (e.g., movies), whereby the picture dynamics (in terms of scene changes, panning, zooming) varies from one movie to another.

This promising combination of techniques --- lexicalized grammar formalisms and the multi-pass parsing method to make them practical, along with similarity-based estimation to aid in solving data sparsity problems --- has the potential to improve language modeling beyond the asymptote that it has reached, with applications in improving speech recognition, information retrieval, and many other language-processing applications.","title":"Advances in Language Modeling through Lexico-Grammatical Methods","awardID":"9712068","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6845","name":"HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["379957"],"PO":["564456"]},"26767":{"abstract":"","title":"Graduate Research Fellowship Program","awardID":"9729822","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0705","name":"Division of ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND CENT","abbr":"EEC"},"pgm":{"id":"1360","name":"HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1101","name":"Division of GRADUATE EDUCATION","abbr":"DGE"},"pgm":{"id":"7172","name":"GRADUATE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1101","name":"Division of GRADUATE EDUCATION","abbr":"DGE"},"pgm":{"id":"7175","name":"MINORITY GRADUATE FELLOWSHIPS"}}],"PIcoPI":["398928"],"PO":["89977"]},"25689":{"abstract":"The research will investigate how modern organizations, comprising interlocked ensembles of people and information technologies, can be understood as `intelligent organizations.` As modern organizations redefine how they develop, process, and assimilate information and manage knowledge, they are increasingly being conceived as large-scale, distributed `cognitive' systems, with properties and processes such as organizational memory, organizational learning, and organizational intelligence.

K is highly heterogeneous, and quantifying the K distribution is a prerequisite to understanding contaminant migration. Over the past decade an increasing number of studies have documented the existence of fractal scaling in K distributions. However, the scaling appears to be of a variable nature that is characterized by a special family of PDF's known as Levy-stable processes. Different sets of increments display properties of different members of the Levy-stable class, which suggests a type of fractal known as a universal multi-fractal. It has been shown recently that the universal multi-fractal paradigm, which includes monofractals as a special case, is successful in modeling the fractal scaling in most K data sets, and the desire to exploit this observation fully is the motivation of the present proposal. The 3 objectives are: I) Develop procedures for the generation and data conditioning of 3-D multi-fractal structures; II) Evaluate multi-fractal effects on solute transport by simulating tracer tests conducted at the highly heterogeneous MADE site; and III) Determine the behavior of plume-scale apparent dispersivity involving multi-fractal scaling and compare the results to that derived from conventional statistical theories. Meeting these 3 objectives will increase understanding significantly of fractal scaling in porous media and the effect on contaminant transport.","title":"Multi-Fractal Scaling of Hydraulic Conductivity Distributions and the Effect on Plume-Scale Contaminant Transport","awardID":"9706048","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"06","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES             ","abbr":"GEO"},"div":{"id":"0603","name":"Division of EARTH SCIENCES","abbr":"EAR"},"pgm":{"id":"1579","name":"HYDROLOGIC SCIENCES"}}],"PIcoPI":[52879,"369796"],"PO":["376131"]},"11950":{"abstract":"Some signal design\/analysis problems relevant to wireless communication are under investigation. Problems in the first class relate to a code-division multiple-access (CDMA) communication scheme in which the receiver makes optimum multi-user decisions. The effect the selection of a particular sequence family has on the performance of the system is under study. One measure of performance is the capacity, i.e., the number of active users that the system can support. Signature sequences influence this number through their periodic and aperiodic correlation properties. These correlation values tend to diminish performance by reducing the minimum Euclidean distance between distinct multi-user signal sets. Preliminary investigations turned up an interesting example involving Gold sequences of small length in which correlations reduced the Euclidean distance between a multi-user signal and its nearest neighbour to zero. The obvious upper bound on capacity obtained by replacing each aperiodic correlation by the maximum over the entire sequence family provides much too conservative an estimate. Thus improved upper bounds are currently being sought. This requires a better understanding of the distribution of aperiodic correlation values obtained by picking a randomly-delayed random subset of the entire family of signature sequences. This distribution is under study both for a family of signature sequences in general as well as for specific families known to be efficient with respect to periodic correlation measures. The understanding gained, will be used in the design of improved signal sets. For example, preliminary investigations suggest that when communicating data using phase-shift keying, improved performance will result if each user's phase transitions never exceed 90 degrees since this has the effect of distributing the aperiodic correlations across the real and imaginary axes as opposed to simply the real axis. The second class of problems under investigation deals with the IS-54\/IS-136 North American digital cellular standard. Here the goal is to come up with an efficient forward error-correction (FEC) scheme well matched to the IS-54\/136 channel. The motivtion came from previous work in which a nonlinear binary FEC code identified by the author (the Nordstrom Robinson code) turned out under soft-decision decoding, to improve uniformly upon the performance of the convolutional code used in the current IS-54 standard. This was to the surprise of many in both industry and academia as the binary code is of short block length (16) and has a small minimum distance (6), whereas the IS-54 employs a rate 1\/2 convolutional code of contraint length (6). The reason for this improved performance is under investigation and attempts are under way to identify the code best matched to this channel. Some other problems of a miscellaneous nature, all relevant to improved wireless communcation are also being studied.","title":"Topics in Signal Design and Signal Analysis for Wireless Communication","awardID":"9612864","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4096","name":"COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["562301"],"PO":["150411"]},"22961":{"abstract":"This project aims to analyze imperative, object-oriented programs for type signature information, which can help automate several programming tasks that are currently performed manually.

Present day communication systems are primarily designed for data communications at a fixed rate and are poorly matched to video data, which is more tolerant of errors and is characterized by fluctuating rates. The quality of wireless channels can also vary greatly, and the video coding and transmission should be adapted to these changing conditions. Existing hardware implementations are equally inflexible, being designed independently for pre-specified conditions and a fixed power consumption. The match between current video compressors, wireless modems, and their hardware is thus often very poor. This research addresses the joint design of video communication components to maximize the overall system design of video communication components to maximize the overall system performance. While achieving unprecedented performance in low-power image and video transmission over wireless channels, this research also develops a powerful and general new methodology for directly coupling chip design with signal processing algorithms and overall system optimization. The research obtains dramatic improvements in end-to-end video transport over wireless communication links through adaptive, joint optimization of source coding, channel coding, and VLSI computation. Instead of selecting fixed operating points for the source coder, channel coder, and the VLSI hardware, dynamically adjustable coders and hardware supporting a variety of operating points is being developed.

The symbols in the database are not necessarily classified in advance thereby permitting variation in the quality of the match. Queries to the database involve matching contextual, and spatial constrains.

The spatial constraints include topological relations such as overlap, encloses, and intersects as well as distance and direction. The symbols are not restricted to point objects thereby also including objects with extent such as lines and areas.

In this new scheme, termed Multiply-Detected Macrodiversity (MDM), the signals at multiple base stations are detected and used as input to a Decision Algorithm, which provides an optimal decision of what was transmitted. The MDM scheme shows considerable improvement in the Bit-Error Rate (BER), especially when the mobile is close to the boundary between cells. As the boundary between cells is exactly the region in which the quality of the mobile's signal is mostly impaired, the MDM scheme has the effect of equalizing the BER throughout the system coverage area. The Decision Algorithm of the MDM scheme requires as an input, in addition to the separate detections of the receivers, also an estimation of the quality of the received signals, so that appropriate\"weightings\" of these signals can be applied in the post-detection combining process. To obtain estimates, usually some sort of channel measurement is performed; e.g., the signal power (S-diversity) or the Signal-to-Interference-Ratio (S\/I-diversity). In such cases, the measurement process complicates the design of the transmitter\/receiver hardware and the operation of the system. Furthermore, the measurements are subject to high variance and need to be averaged over time. To avoid the disadvantage of the measurement-based quality of signal estimation, we propose here to investigate the use of channel coding to evaluate the transmission characteristics of a wireless channel for macrodiversity reception. The proposed channel estimation schemes use side information generated during the decoding process.In summary, we intend to study the use of the MDM combining with coded channel estimation in the case of a single site equipped with multiple,widely-separated receivers and in the case of multiple cell sites. In the latter case, we will investigate the use of both post-detection and predetection combining (with quantization of the recei ved signal), comparing the performance in the schemes in the presence of channel impairments characteristic to the mobile communication environment.","title":"Coded Diversity Combining and Channel Estimation for Wireless Data Communications","awardID":"9706592","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4096","name":"COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["450625","438934"],"PO":["150411"]},"23237":{"abstract":"This project concerns equational reasoning, with emphasis on word and unification problems.

The approach to word problems will use the rewriting paradigm, concentrating on procedures and data structures for computing complete\/canonical sets of rewrite rules. In particular, the method using SOUR graphs for completing rewrite systems will be investigated, particularly the way in which SOUR Graphs can be used to develop procedures for solving the word problem in certain classes of theories. The first part of the research will be to examine the procedure in its simplest form, on string rewriting systems. Once methods are developed to solve the word problem in its simplest form, those methods will be moved back into pure equational logic, and finally into full first order equational logic. For ground equational theories, the plan is to investigate techniques for computing congruence closures based on the rewriting paradigm developed in studying Shostak's congruence closure method. Applications to combinations of decision procedures will be investigated. The relationship between the congruence closure method and SOUR graphs will be investigated and exploited. In unification, the concentration is on semantic unification, where some of the function symbols have semantics associated with them, usually specified in the form of an equational theory.

The focus of the work is the development of a general, scalable architecture to support fast querying of very large image databases with user-specified distance measures. This includes the development of distance-measure-independent algorithms and data structures for efficient image retrieval from large databases. Methods for merging the general, distance-measure-independent algorithms with other useful techniques that may be distance measure specific, such as keyword retrieval and relational indexing, are being pursued. The problem of providing users with multiple distance measures of many different varieties is being studied. New methods for combining distance measures and a language in which users can specify their queries without detailed knowledge of the underlying metrics are being designed. A prototype system is being implemented to test the developed methods, and evaluation is being performed on both a large general image database and a smaller controlled database. The results of this research will be: (1) techniques that facilitate rapid retrieval of images by eliminating huge portions of the image database from the search, making content-based retrieval feasible on very large and growing databases; (2) new, high-level methods by which users can combine distance measures to form meaningful queries, so that content-based queries can become a standard way to query image databases; and (3) a general framework for content-based retrieval that can accommodate new distance measures as they are developed by other research efforts.

And yet the whole classical approach to dynamic database indexing has long since become inappropriate and increasingly inadequate: we are moving rapidly from the conventional one-dimensional world of fixed-structure text and numbers to a multi-dimensional world of variable structures, objects and images, in space and time. This project is based on a new multi-dimensional indexing technology which rejects conventional benchmark criteria in favor of a natural principle intuitively understood by users: the more information given to guide a query, the faster the response - regardless of any particular instantiation pattern. As a result, conventional relational indexing becomes much more flexible, with some classes of query improving on average by an order of magnitude, while retaining the logarithmic storage and update characteristics of the B-tree. But the main feature of the technology is its applicability to a much wider range of data types -- from nested relations to logic clauses, and from spatial objects to pictorial images. Two specific areas show particular promise: the efficient indexing of large rule bases, and substantially improved performance of very large and mission-critical GIS (geographic information systems) applications.

Whereas much research has gone into concurrency, resulting in a wealth of results integrated into a fairly mature theory, recovery has remained limited to mostly implementation-specific knowledge.

Motivated by these inadequacies and by the need to support recovery for applications such as information retrieval, workflows, and mobile computing this project is developing means for specifying the recovery requirements of an application, identifying the recovery abstractions and protocols needed to realize complex recovery requirements, working toward the modular construction of recovery based on standard abstractions and protocols, developing ways to demonstrate the correctness of this construction, and enumerating the tradeoffs involved in implementing given recovery requirements. All of these facilitate the adjustment of recovery to changing infrastructure support and application requirements.

More specifically, we ask the questions of how to efficiently locate users within massively accessed internet (we refer to a network of networks as an internet), based on the micro-networking communication environment and how to limit the multimedia connection admission in such an environment, as to guarantee quality of service to already accepted connections. Our approach is based on the idea of User Mobility Profile (UMP). As a user roams within an internet, the system continuously collects information on the users' mobility and connection patterns. This information is used to anticipate the future location of the active users, thus, reduces the search space and, consequently, the cost of locating the user. This is achieved through the dynamic calculation of location area. In our approach, the location area is defined per mobile and is calculated, using the UMP, ``on the fly,'' as the user roams between different networks. Calculation of the location area is done as to minimize the user's mobility management cost. Furthermore, the statistical knowledge of users' future positions embedded within the UMP allows prediction of resource utilization and, thus, reduces the probability of resource shortage. The result is that multimedia connections can be supported with a much stricter Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees. To achieve the goal of guaranteed QoS, we employ a new concept, called the Shadow Clique, which is the representation of the probability of user's future locations, given its current position in the network. The Shadow Clique is, in fact, a digest of the UMP and allows easy and fast determination of the future resource requirements in different network s. In our research we will address the following issues using both analytical and simulation tools: 1. The optimal strategy for UMP information reporting and collection 2. The use of the UMP for reducing the registration requirements and the user location costs 3. Methods for grouping the networks into paging groups, as to reduce the mobile paging costs, subject to delay constraints 4. The use of the UMP to create the Shadow Clique digest 5. The use of the Shadow Clique concept to predict the future network resource utilization 6. The use of the Shadow Clique concept in the Connection Admission algorithm It is obvious that as the six topics are highly related, a close collaborative interaction and continuous exchange of information and results is essential for the success of this project. To estimate the potential impact of our work, one must envisage the future use of the Internet services and the mobile applications. These are responsible for much of the recent research in the Mobile Multimedia field. However, before a wide-spread use of the mobile applications can be realized, the fundamental questions of how to manage the mobility of such large volume of users and how to manage the resources for multimedia communication need to be addressed. Our proposal is a significant step in this direction.","title":"Mobility Resource Management for Multimedia Mobile Computing","awardID":"9704393","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["562752"],"PO":["194325"]},"23710":{"abstract":"9714102 This project sponsors a Workshop on Higher-Order Operational Techniques in Semantics (HOOTS II) held at Stanford during December 8-12, 1997.

Transformations do not always yield good optimizations, particularly where the cost\/benefit tradeoffs are not highly obvious.

This method has recently been applied to address the problem of multivariate polynomial resultants. Initial successes include finding determinental formulae for some sparse resultants. The method of moving surfaces produces expressions that are more compact than previous ones, and unlike previous determinental formulae do not contain extraneous factors. Multivariate resultants provide a powerful computational tool for solving problems involving polynomial equations in several variables. While Groebner bases can also be used to solve systems of polynomial equations (as well as answer additional questions about polynomial systems), multivariate resultants are generally more efficient at eliminating variables than Groebner bases. Preliminary examples suggest that the method of moving surfaces might be even more efficient than current multivariate resultant techniques. The method of moving surfaces can be used to attack a wide variety of problems in elimination theory including: 1. constructing multivariate resultants without extraneous factors 2. building sparse resultants 3. implicitizing rational curves and surfaces 4. developing inversion formulas for rational curves and surfaces 5. intersecting rational curves and surfaces 6. intersecting algebraic curves and surfaces. The method of moving curves has already lead to a new classification scheme for rational curves; a similar scheme for rational surfaces will be investigated. While rigorous theoretical foundation for the method of moving curves based on ideal theory has been developed, the method of moving surfaces is currently substantiated only by several Mathematica examples and a few preliminary theorems. Thus the theoretical foundation is far from complete. For example, the method provides an algorithm for determining the rows of a matrix whose determinant is a sparse resultant if it does not vanish. So far, the method has never failed to produce a non-vanishing determinant, but no proof exists that the method will never fail. A constructive proof will be sought. The method has thus far been applied to eliminating one variable from two polynomials, or two variables from three polynomials. The general problem of eliminating n-1 variables from n polynomial equations will be studied.","title":"Resultants and Implicitization by Moving Surfaces","awardID":"9712345","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"1999-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":["254152"],"PO":["187585"]},"23238":{"abstract":"The \"computational geometry to mathematical programming\" (CGtoMP) reduction strategy has three parts. 1) Formulate a task involving complex interactions between non-convex geometric objects as an optimization problem. 2) Develop algorithms of computational geometry that reduce the geometric problem to a non- geometric optimization problem. 3) Solve the optimization problem using techniques from mathematical programming: linear, quadratic, convex, and integer programming.

However, attempts to execute such specifications using traditional logic programming techniques usually do not terminate, and are thus impractical. This project seeks to create a logic programming system which can solve such problems and draws on recent research in tabled and constraint logic programming. Tabled logic programming, particularly the XSB system, terminates for large classes of programs, and permits reasoning in the presence of inconsistent information through its semantics for default negation. Constraint logic programming allows problems in theories such as the real numbers to be expressed declaratively and solved automatically. The project will create a unified computational basis for the two paradigms using XSB as a starting point. For certain problems in the verification of concurrent systems and in program analysis, large programs based on C already have been replaced with a few hundred XSB rules with no loss in efficiency. The project will increase the number of such problems for which a logic-based specification leads to an efficient, practical system. ***","title":"CAREER: Principles, Practice, and Applications of Tabled Logic Programs","awardID":"9702681","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}}],"PIcoPI":["52829"],"PO":["397849"]},"19828":{"abstract":"This research develops a novel database system architecture that efficiently supports queries over rich data types like multi-media, time-series, matrices, and documents. Complex data types are modeled as Enhanced Abstract Data Types (E-ADTs), which are software modules with a common interface. While the uniform interface leads to extensibility, it also exposes semantic information that can be used for query optimization. The E-ADT architecture is demonstrated through the development of the PREDATOR database system. The project studies optimizations that are essential to efficiently support each data type, and extensions of these techniques across multiple data types. While initial results demonstrate major performance improvements compared to existing database systems, several issues are being explored further. What should be the contents of a toolkit for data type development? Can the mechanism for extensible types be extended to implement a heterogeneous database system? How does one build an extensible database system in a Web environment? The project is developing solutions to all these issues and demonstrating them in PREDATOR. The educational goal of the project is to provide a freely available, full-function, modern database system for the database community to use for educational and research purposes. To this end, the code base of PREDATOR is being released, and the functionality of the system is being augmented with many standard database features.

This is a growing trend, spurred by the large investments needed to upgrade and expand networks, especially in the case of ATM technology --a single large switch can cost millions of dollars. Typically, work focuses on individual problems as they arise, and the resulting algorithms (whether completely heuristic or based on thoroughly grounded techniques) heavily depend on many particular details of the problem at hand. A similar approach is used by researchers at universities. Other than completely general optimization techniques --such as general purpose integer programming codes or heuristics such as simulated annealing-- which usually do not prove satisfactory, no successful common approach exists. However, network layout problems of all flavors do share many common components. Our views on this matter were spurred by our experience with practical ATM layout problems. In ATM network layout several interrelated subproblems arise. There is a transmission system subproblem: on every link enough capacity must be installed to carry the traffic routed on it. There is a similar switch sizing subproblem (except that capacity is installed at nodes, not links). There may be a further subproblem concerning allocation of terminations at switches, again of a similar nature. Finally, different types of routings may be allowed, for example, requiring survivability. An algorithm for a complex problem of this type may therefore need to handle each subproblem well (in case that subproblem is cost-dominant in a particular application) but would also need to integrate the different components into a coherent single unit (for example, the edge transmission system subproblem will interact with the switch sizing subproblem). Network design problems can be classifed as mixed-integer programs: the y involve variables that must take integral values (e.g. the number of transmission systems to install in a particular link) and also continuous variables (mainly traffic routing decisions, which are effectively modeled without requiring integrality). From a computational viewpoint these problems are typically very difficult. Purely heuristic algorithms are notoriously unreliable in terms of the quality of the solutions they provide. At the other end difficult network design problems routinely trounce high-performance general-purpose integer programming algorithms. See problems \"dano3mip\" and \"danoint\" of the MIPLIB family (http:\/\/www.caam.rice.edu\/~bixby\/miplib\/miplib.html) and other problems in the PI's previous work. A final argument in favor of a general-purpose network design algorithm, concerns one way in which network design is used in practice. No network planner will commit to an expenditure of several million dollars on the basis of a single run of an optimization algorithm, no matter how good a track record this algorithm has. Typically, an algorithm would be used in the context of a study where a design tool is run repeatedly. Here it is crucial to get fast, good-quality estimates. The research supported by this award focuses in developing a generic network design tool. We plan to develop several fairly independent components of such a tool, principally: * Fast, approximate algorithms for continuous linear programs arising in network layout problems, in particular, parallelizable versions thereof for a shared-memory environment. * General \"cutting-plane\" techniques for the mixed-integer programs we are interested in, and * Fast rounding heuristics to quickly obtain good feasible solutions.","title":"Next-generation algorithms for network layout","awardID":"9706029","effectiveDate":"1997-09-15","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["283751"],"PO":["194325"]},"22622":{"abstract":"This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's \"Connections to the Internet\" announcement, NSF 96-64.

In parallel, an experimental physical layer wireless modem has been developed that implements many advanced algorithms from communication theory. This project uses these past developments to produce high quality research to: -> Develop new algorithms for important wireless data communication applications; -> Produce techniques to analyze the performance and stability of these algorithms,; -> Deploy and experiment with new algorithms on realistic wireless channels to verify the theory and to formulate more accurate analytical signal models. Symbol-by-symbol MAP demodulation is important in a wide variety of digital communication applications. Turbo codes have recently sparked significant interest due to their near capacity performance and their relatively simple demodulation architecture. MAP decoding is very important in Turbo decoding and the project will explore methods to reduce complexity of standard Turbo decoding in a principled fashion and explore noniterative techniques for Turbo decoding based on approximations to optimal MAP decoding. Additionally MAP demodulation is very important in interleaved coded systems commonly used in wireless communications. This project explores soft output algorithms for use in time-varying frequency flat and frequency selective fading channels. In particular, we are exploring high performance demodulators for time-division multiple-access applications like IS-136 and for digital television. In high capacity applications, interference suppression has greatly increased in significance. This project will extend the model-based MAP paradigm to develop high performance demodulators for signals in the presence of co-channel interference using both a conventional single antenna modem and ''space-time'' modem architectures. Another unique feature of our project is that we consi der soft output demodulation\/decoding in an integrated framework with receiver front-end design (e.g., equalization, synchronization). Such an approach is essential for operating at the low SNR's necessary to take advantage of powerful codes (e.g., Turbo codes). A further unique aspect of this project is that we intend to study the resulting algorithms in a much greater depth than is traditionally attempted. This project will apply sophisticated analytical techniques to analyze the performance and stability of many of the proposed algorithms. This analysis will provide a greater insight into the performance of these algorithms than can be achieved via simulation study alone. We also intend to implement and field test many of the proposed algorithms. We currently have a working wireless modem and new algorithms can be added by a simple change of software. This combination of algorithm development, algorithm analysis, and algorithm implementation will lead to significant new insight into communication theory especially in the wireless area. This combined approach will also provide a more well-rounded educational experience for the student participants.","title":"Model-Based Signal Processing for Digital Communications","awardID":"9706372","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4096","name":"COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["282307"],"PO":["150411"]},"22105":{"abstract":"It funds a major study that will assess issues and derive research topics and policy recommendations for the nature and use of National Information Infrastructure technologies, and for the generation, distribution, and protection of information content that flows within those technologies.

This probe can be programmed to collect pertinent information at any layer in the protocol hierarchy (including application-specific information). * An efficient probing mechanism for endsystems (i.e., workstations and servers) that can collect relevant performance satistics from both applications and kernel resident protocols (such as TCP\/IP in Unix). The endsystem probes introduce minimum interference with protocol operation and can be dynamically and remotely invoked and configured for the information of interest. * A highly flexible and highly efficient software network man agement agent design that extends the functionality and scalability of the network probe by filtering data based on programmable criteria (such as protocol header attributes or application-level frames).

The different layers are typically assigned different ``responsibilities,\" so that the general network design problem can be decomposed into simpler, more manageable problems. However, the independent design of the different layers - which ignores the detailed nature of their mutual interactions, shared constraints, and cumulative impact on the network's overall performance - can lead to inefficiencies. Future wireless communication networks will be required to provide wide coverage and high capacity to mobile users generating bursty multi-media information. This heterogeneous traffic will impose upon the network time-varying quality of service (QoS) constraints. Since many multi-media applications have delay-sensitive information with varying reliability requirements, such as numerical data, voice, and video, the project will take end-to-end delay and data integrity as its dominant system constraints. The goal of this project is, in the broadest sense, to take a more global view of end-to-end performance, to better understand the interactions among the layers, to develop techniques that improve system performance through joint optimization over the various layers and to do so in the context of a end-to-end delay constraint. One key theme of the proposal involves the optimization of system performance in the context of multiple users, particularly in a system which does not employ a cellular-type architecture. This requires the development of techniques that, on the one hand, address the deleterious effects of multiple-user interference at the physical layer, yet also incorporate end-to-end QoS objectives, especially delay, just as with the development of routing and scheduling algorithms. Another major theme will be the determination of the optimal distribution and the real-time dynamics of error control functions implemented across t he layers of the network, subject to specified end-user requirements. This requires investigation of inherent tradeoffs between error-rate and decoding delay of FEC employed at the physical layer, as well as the interactions among error control functions, including retransmission strategies, invoked at higher levels.","title":"Optimization of Delay Constrained Wireless Communication Networks","awardID":"9725568","effectiveDate":"1997-09-15","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["507610","328469","235820","522738"],"PO":["194325"]},"20974":{"abstract":"The aim of this project is to develop an analytical framework that provides new understanding of the interaction of voice and data in an integrated voice\/data CDMA system. The insights obtained from this study will be further used to develop new algorithms. The effect of the variability of data and its impact on the capacity and performance of the voice service in such a multimedia wireless system will be analyzed. New easily implemented real-time strategies for call admission, and control after call setup will be derived for the data service with delay sensitive voice being given priority. The effect of variable quality of service (QoS) the different classes of service may require will be included in the analysis framework and methodology. Further, the interaction between protocol layers will be included in the study and design of access control schemes for data. Specifically, we will analyze the interactions of end-to-end protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) with data access control schemes on the radio link. Analytical Methodology: Analysis of these problems encounters two serious difficulties. Even if all the information (e.g., distributions of relevant random variables) was available, exact analysis appears to be beyond current theory leading to computationally tractable solutions. Secondly, the needed distributions are often not available. We develop instead simple, reasonably accurate, analytic methodology which uses only means and variances, when appropriate, and distributional assumptions when necessary. Data Control Strategies: Recognizing that voice is delay sensitive, we develop data access control strategies. One type of real-time control is based on readily measurable quantities related to voice quality and uses broadcasted permission probabilities to the data users. The proposal will investigate the varied questions associated with the optimization of the data control algorithms. We will develop and analyze such control strategies for both conve ntional and multiuser receivers. Interaction between Protocol Layers : Serious problems can arise when protocol layers are designed independently but end up with unexpected interactions. We address this in the context of a data access control strategy operating under TCP. We investigate the problems due to such interactions and appropriate modifications in the light of the interactions. Significance of this Project: This project will provide a more complete understanding of the complex issues of voice\/data integration. This will include development of analytical methodology which is convenient to use and consistent with the limited information expected to be available. New effective real-time algorithms will be developed for both conventional and multiuser receivers. Further, the study of the interactions between data link retransmission schemes and higher layer reliability protocols (like TCP) should provide valuable insights into system design for optimum coexistence of diverse traffic. The work will thus provide a better understanding of the complex interactions both between service types with different traffic characteristics and different QoS requirements, and between different protocol layers. This will lead to improved design of real-time algorithms for data.","title":"Capacity and Protocols for Integrated Voice\/Data CDMA Systems","awardID":"9706036","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4096","name":"COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["475434","67495"],"PO":["150411"]},"22811":{"abstract":"9711141 Warsi, Nazir A.

To evaluate the impact on scientific applications, optimizations will be implemented as passes in the Stanford SUIF compiler and tested on benchmark suites such as Perfect, NAS, and SPEC for both scalar and parallel architectures.","title":"Data Layout Optimizations for High-Performance Architectures","awardID":"9711514","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2876","name":"DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["157565"],"PO":["250083"]},"20414":{"abstract":"The goal of this project is to investigate the use of adaptive techniques to minimize the power consumed by peripherals in mobile computing systems. Since battery life is one of the most critical resources in the mobile computing environment, good energy conservation methods can dramatically increase the utility of mobile systems. The investigators have previously demonstrated that new adaptive techniques from the machine learning community are very effective in solving disk spin-down problem (deciding when to shut down the disk in order to maximize power savings) on traces of disk activity. The project will continue this work in two directions. The first direction is to compare the performance of the new techniques with that of other adaptive algorithms for the spin-down problem. The second direction involves applying similar machine learning methods to wireless modems (radios). In addition to the power savings gained by turning off the radio when the network interface is not needed, adaptively choosing the broadcast power level may also lead to significant energy savings.","title":"Predictive Power Conservation","awardID":"9704348","effectiveDate":"1997-09-15","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2876","name":"DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["92323","540846"],"PO":["250083"]},"20436":{"abstract":"Project URL: http:\/\/www.ee.gatech.edu\/research\/labs\/bwn\/projects\/nsf http:\/\/www.ee.cornell.edu\/~haas\/nsf.html In this proposal, we deal with two central issues in Multimedia Mobile Computing, namely Mobility Management and Connection Admission. More specifically, we ask the questions of how to efficiently locate users within massively accessed internet (we refer to a network of networks as an internet), based on the micro-networking communication environment and how to limit the multimedia connection admission in such an environment, as to guarantee quality of service to already accepted connections. Our approach is based on the idea of User Mobility Profile (UMP). As a user roams within an internet, the system continuously collects information on the users' mobility and connection patterns. This information is used to anticipate the future location of the active users, thus, reduces the search space and, consequently, the cost of locating the user. This is achieved through the dynamic calculation of location area. In our approach, the location area is defined per mobile and is calculated, using the UMP, ``on the fly,'' as the user roams between different networks. Calculation of the location area is done as to minimize the user's mobility management cost. Furthermore, the statistical knowledge of users' future positions embedded within the UMP allows prediction of resource utilization and, thus, reduces the probability of resource shortage. The result is that multimedia connections can be supported with a much stricter Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees. To achieve the goal of guaranteed QoS, we employ a new concept, called the Shadow Clique, which is the representation of the probability of user's future locations, given its current position in the network. The Shadow Clique is, in fact, a digest of the UMP and allows easy and fast determination of the future resource requirements in different network s. In our research we will address the following issues using both analytical and simulation tools: 1. The optimal strategy for UMP information reporting and collection 2. The use of the UMP for reducing the registration requirements and the user location costs 3. Methods for grouping the networks into paging groups, as to reduce the mobile paging costs, subject to delay constraints 4. The use of the UMP to create the Shadow Clique digest 5. The use of the Shadow Clique concept to predict the future network resource utilization 6. The use of the Shadow Clique concept in the Connection Admission algorithm It is obvious that as the six topics are highly related, a close collaborative interaction and continuous exchange of information and results is essential for the success of this project. To estimate the potential impact of our work, one must envisage the future use of the Internet services and the mobile applications. These are responsible for much of the recent research in the Mobile Multimedia field. However, before a wide-spread use of the mobile applications can be realized, the fundamental questions of how to manage the mobility of such large volume of users and how to manage the resources for multimedia communication need to be addressed. Our proposal is a significant step in this direction.","title":"Mobility and Resource Management for Multimedia Mobile Computing","awardID":"9704404","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2003-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["438934"],"PO":["234222"]},"22988":{"abstract":"This project investigates the interaction between text compression and text retrieval, and aims to build a parallel text retrieval system called Codir that allows compression-domain text indexing and retrieval.

Astonishingly violent \"fish wars\" have erupted, leaving cooperative arrangements in disarray, fishing communities economically depressed, and fish stocks at risk of collapse. This project is designed to reexamine, in the light of modern game-theoretic concepts, the core reasons for this instability of cooperative management, and to identify new institutional arrangements which might prove to be more stable. The work proposed involves formulation and analysis of game-theoretic models of a bi- national jointly managed ``shared'' fishery, where the stocks are harvested sequentially as they migrate across national boundaries. The models are necessarily dynamic, since strategic interactions are conditioned by past performance, as well as by projected future circumstances. Emphasis is placed on pervasive uncertainty and the role of incomplete information that is common in decision making. Specific issues to be studied are: 1)institutional incentives which have led to over-investment in fleets and processing facilities; 2) tradeoffs between long term goals of conservation and sustainability and short term goals of socioeconomic stability; 3) strategic interactions, conditioned by the particular ecological structure of the ecological community of harvested fish species; and 4) the design of institutional arrangements which can promote stable cooperative joint management of a marine fishery in uncertain and unanticipated circumstances.

University of California - Berkeley CISE Postdoctoral Research Associates in Experimental CS: Design and Simulation of Algorithms and Mechanisms for Precision Assembly (This award supports CES associate Karl Bohringer.) Progress in miniaturization of mass-produced commercial products requires improvements and innovation in precision assembly. Products such as magnetic storage systems, palmtop and wearable computers, or telecommunications devices often require submicron-level assembly operations. Increasingly, the components for such assemblies are batch-fabricated in MEMS (micro electro mechanical system) technology, often yielding thousands of components in one parallel fabrication run. In contrast to the highly automated fabrication of MEMS components, current assembly techniques are rather limited. Conventional, sequential pick-and-place assembly is extremely inefficient or impractical for such applications, because of the small size of the components and the high accuracy required. Instead, novel techniques are proposed for parallel self-assembly. Active surfaces (i.e., surfaces that can generate two-dimensional force vector fields) permit the precise positioning, orienting, and sorting of small parts with little or no sensor feedback. Vibration and fluidic agitation can generate a motive force for parallel assembly. Mechanical compliance, using micro-chamfers and latches, can be exploited to reduce the degrees of freedom of the components. Detailed models are developed to describe precision parallel assembly using three techniques: mechanical vibration, fluidic agitation, and active surfaces. The motive force response for each of these techniques is analyzed, and simulations with a modeling system are performed. Physical experiments are performed to confirm that our models accurately reflect measured behavior.","title":"Postdoc: ECS Postdoctoral Associate: Design and Simulation of Algorithms and Mechanisms for Precision Assembly","awardID":"9705022","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"1999-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["520937"],"PO":["297837"]},"11638":{"abstract":"This project studies the computational complexity of finding approximate solutions to NP-optimization problems through an investigation of the structure of complexity classes in the bounded query hierarchy. Many questions about these complexity classes remain open. For example, it is not known whether a polynomial time Turing machine using a linear number of oracle queries to an NP-complete set can recognize more languages than one which uses only log n queries. Recent works have established close connections between NP-approximation problems and the bounded query hierarchy. As a result, there is a direct correspondence between open questions of whether finding an optimum Traveling Salesman tour can be reduced to finding a 2- approximate tour (one that has at most twice the length of the optimum tour). If such a reduction were possible, it would imply that there is no significant difference in the complexity of finding approximate versus optimum solutions for many NP-complete problems. This would drastically alter the present understanding of the nature of NP-completeness. The conjecture motivating this research is that such a reduction does not exist. However, currently, its existence is not known to violate any of the common intractability assumptions (e.g. that P NP or that the Polynomial Hierarchy does not collapse).

Advanced ZPL is intended as the programming language for scientific and engineering computations that are to be run on parallel supercomputers. Unlike ZPL (and other antecedent data parallel languages) Advanced ZPL is suitable for general parallel algorithms. Advanced ZPL contains ZPL as a proper subset, giving it full support for data parallel computation. In addition, Advanced ZPL provides the capability to express thread parallelism, task parallelism and pipelining. ZPL provides array data structures, while Advanced ZPL adds general data structuring capabilities. Control over data motion and computational granularity are provided. The goal is to produce a precise specification with which to write sample applications. Based on these applications users can assess the convenience and expressivity of Advanced ZPL, and compiler writers can formulate ways to produce efficient, portable code for it.","title":"Advanced ZPL Compiler","awardID":"9710284","effectiveDate":"1997-09-15","expirationDate":"1998-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"4725","name":"EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS\/CADRE"}}],"PIcoPI":["346688"],"PO":["79544"]},"21739":{"abstract":"As the number and significance of concurrent software systems continue to increase, the need for reliable methods to ensure that these systems behave as intended becomes more pressing. A number of very different analysis techniques have been proposed by researchers, but experience with these techniques is limited chiefly to simple academic programs and little is known about which techniques and tools are most appropriate for particular problems, or how to use the techniques effectively in practice. This project involves carrying out a series of experiments to gain information on the applicability of these techniques to real concurrent programs. These experiments include the analysis of several real programs as well as controlled experiments with special programs designed to isolate particular features identified in the analysis of real programs as having significant impact on the utility of one or more of the analysis tools. The results of those experiments will provide guidance to software developers, feedback to researchers developing analysis techniques, and a set of benchmark programs and properties that can be used in the development and evaluation of additional analysis techniques.","title":"Experimental Study of Static Analysis Techniques for Concurrent Software","awardID":"9708184","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"4725","name":"EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS\/CADRE"}}],"PIcoPI":["536736"],"PO":["179487"]},"23928":{"abstract":"As computer communication networks evolve from offering best-effort service to offering real-time services with stringent Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees (e.g. video), the need for improved fault management techniques increases. Network fault management is an open problem that continues to increase in complexity. A major cause of the increase in complexity of this problem is the heterogeneity of networks. Networks of today are comprised of a variety of technologies (e.g. Wireless, ATM, Ethernet), that are expected to support a diverse set of networked applications (file transfer, WWW, video conferencing). The fault management problem has been studied in varying degrees for different technologies, but there are many open issues 29 , 40 , and we are unaware of any methods that can effectively be applied across technologies. Current methods are largely ad hoc and rely on the expertise of a human network manager. Even within single-technology networks (e.g. Ethernet LANs), strategies developed for one network, cannot be easily generalized to other networks. In addition, the rate of change within a network makes it difficult for the network manager to maintain a high enough level of expertise to develop and maintain effective fault management strategies. New techniques that can be generalized and applied across technologies are needed to ensure network reliability in an efficient manner. The long-term goal of this research is to automate as much of network management as possible. Within network management, we will first focus on fault management. Along these lines, the plan is to develop methods for fault management that (1) can be applied across different technologies, (2) can generalize from network to network, and (3) can adapt to changes in the network. Previous research 12 , 13 , 14 has demonstrated that adaptive statistical techniques can be used for network fault detection. These types of techniques use the network measur ements to learn the behavior of the network and can thus be generalized. The goal for this planning period is to identify a set of problems within fault management that can be addressed using rigorous, generalizable methods. Fault management encompasses a large, complex set of problems that have not been well studied or defined. Before methods are evaluated, the problems to be addressed must be identified. Each network technology will be studied in terms of fault management, and a set of issues that are common across all or most of the technologies will be extracted. For each of the problems that are identified, the feasibility of using automated techniques and generalization will be evaluated. Preliminary results will be obtained using the TCP\/IP test network. The result of the planning activities will be a research direction that is focused on a set of feasible problems that are widely applicable across network technologies. A web page will be created for the fault management research planning project. The web page will contain a description of the activities and results obtained. The URL of the web page will be http:\/\/www.nml.csam.iit.edu\/~planning\/.","title":"A Foundation for Generalized Network Fault Management","awardID":"9714750","effectiveDate":"1997-09-15","expirationDate":"2000-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["560175"],"PO":["150490"]},"22917":{"abstract":"With the widespread use of object-oriented programming languages, including C++ and Java, programs that do a significant amount of heap storage allocation are becoming increasingly widespread and important. This project investigates aggressive implementation policies that can improve reference locality in allocation-intensive programs, both in languages with and without garbage collection. Specifically, the approach followed here uses profile-based optimization and predicts the objects that are likely to be highly referenced at the time they are allocated. It also investigates object splitting, in which the representation of objects is split into multiple parts, and the more frequently referenced parts are co-located. There are three primary contributions arising from this research. First, it investigates the empirical properties of programs in languages that use manual (e.g., C++) and automatic (e.g., Java) storage reclamation. It shows that C programs exhibit exploitable behavior, and it expands these results to other languages. Second, this project develops, evaluates and compares alternative algorithms for identifying and exploiting predictable reference behavior. Finally, it shows that prototype implementations of the algorithms being investigated can significantly increase performance in substantial programs.","title":"Improving the Locality of Reference in Heap-Allocation Intensive Programs","awardID":"9711398","effectiveDate":"1997-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2876","name":"DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":[57552],"PO":["250083"]}}
