## Overview

The raw award data is warehoused by the NSF and obtainable through the nsf.gov website,
[here](_http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/download.jsp_). There is also a RESTful endpoint which
can be used to download the data by year:

    http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/download?DownloadFileName=`2014`&All=true

Each file that is downloaded is a zipped XML file with a listing of all awards for that year.
So for instance, a POST request to the above URI will return a zipped XML file that contains
all the award data for the year 2014. The schema for the XML data can be seen
[here](_http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/resources/Award.xsd_). It will be elaborated upon below
in order to formulate ideas for and detail assumptions made when parsing the awards into a
cleaned form which will be stored in a SQL database. The goal of this effort is to produce a
high quality representation of the data with minimal redundancy and maximum clarity, while
ensuring the XML representation of the awards is interpreted correctly.

## XML Schema Breakdown

Each year is downloaded as a zip file and is named using the year: `<year>.zip`.
Each zip file contains a bunch of XML files, each containing info for exactly one
award. These files are named using the award ID: `<awardID>.xml`. Each XML file has
a `rootTag>`, followed by an `<Award>` tag which contains the following elements:

## NSF Organization Hierarchy

The NSF is organized into a hierarchy of sub-organizations. There are two top-level types of sub-organizations.

1.  Directorate: in charge of multiple divisions.
    1.  Division: in charge of multiple programs.
        1.  Program: each program has only one controlling division.
2.  Office: can be organized into multiple subordinate offices and divisions, as well as multiple subordinate programs.
    *   Each office/sub-office may have arbitrarily many sub-offices/divisions.
    *   Programs encompassed by offices are uniquely controlled by only one office.
    *   Offices can be thought of like directories in a file system, where programs are files and sub-offices
        are sub-directories.
    *   Some offices are further divided into branches, but these are not tied to programs, so they are not
        particularly interesting for a program-centric dataset.

Unique identifiers:

1.  Directorate/Division: both uniquely identified by a string abbreviation; see the
    [NSF orglist](http://www.nsf.gov/staff/orglist.jsp)
3.  Program: uniquely identified by the program code, which is 4 characters, where characters can be digits or letters.
    * note that the same program may be identified by a variety of different codes
        - each uniquely identifies the program
        - different codes are generated by the same program if:
            1.  it moves from one division/office to another
            2.  it's purpose changes significantly
            3.  other miscellaneous reasons motivated by accounting needs cause it to
4.  Institution: no fundamentally unique identifier; the address/name combo is probably the least ambiguous.

### American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009

The economic stimulus package of $787 billion (Also known as the "Recovery Act",
was signed into law by the President on February 17, 2009; it is the economic
stimulus package of $787 billion. "Making supplemental appropriations for job
preservation and creation, infrastructure investment, energy efficiency and
science, assistance to the unemployed, and State and local fiscal stabilization,
for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2009, and for other purposes".

### Funding Opportunity Announcement

A publicly available document by which a federal agency makes known its intentions
to award discretionary grants or cooperative agreements, usually as a result of
competition for funds. Funding opportunity announcements may be known as program
announcements, notices of funding availability, solicitations, or other names
depending on the agency and type of program. Funding opportunity announcements
can be found at Grants.gov/FIND and on the Internet at the funding agency's or
program's website.

### Assistance Awards

Awards that entail the transfer of money, property, services or other things of
value from the Federal government to a recipient to accomplish a public purpose
of support or stimulation. In the case of NSF, assistance awards involve the
support or stimulation of scientific and engineering research, science and
engineering education or other related activities. NSF is authorized to use
grants or cooperative agreements for this purpose.

#### Grant

A type of assistance award and a legal instrument which permits an executive
agency of the Federal government to transfer money, property, services or
other things of value to a grantee when no substantial involvement is anticipated
between the agency and the recipient during the performance of the contemplated
activity. Grants are the primary mechanism of NSF support. NSF awards the following
two types of grants.

##### Standard Grant

A type of grant in which NSF agrees to provide a specific level of support for a
specified period of time with no statement of NSF intent to provide additional
future support without submission of another proposal.

##### Continuing Grant

A type of grant in which NSF agrees to provide a specific level of support for
an initial specified period of time, usually a year, with a statement of intent
to provide additional support of the project for additional periods, provided
funds are available and the results achieved warrant further support.

#### Cooperative Agreement

A type of assistance award which should be used when substantial agency involvement
is anticipated during the project performance period. Substantial agency
involvement may be necessary when an activity is technically and/or managerially
complex and requires extensive or close coordination between NSF and the awardee.
Examples of projects which might be suitable for cooperative agreements if there
will be substantial agency involvement are: research centers, policy studies, large
curriculum projects, multi-user facilities, projects which involve complex
subcontracting, construction or operations of major in-house university facilities
and major instrumentation development.

#### Cost Reimbursement Award

A type of grant under which NSF agrees to reimburse the grantee for work performed
and/or costs incurred by the grantee up to the total amount specified in the grant.
Such costs must be allowable in accordance with the applicable cost principles
(e.g., OMB Circular A-21, Cost Principles for Educational Institutions or OMB
Circular A-122, Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations). Accountability is
based primarily on technical progress, financial accounting and fiscal reporting.
Except under certain programs and under special circumstances, NSF grants and
cooperative agreements are normally cost reimbursement type awards.

#### Fixed Amount Award

A type of grant used in certain programs and situations under which NSF agrees to
provide a specific level of support without regard to actual costs incurred under
the project. The award amount is negotiated using the applicable cost principles
or other pricing information as a guide. This type of grant reduces some of the
administrative burden and record-keeping requirements for both the grantee and NSF.
Except under unusual circumstances, such as termination, there is no governmental
review of the actual costs subsequently incurred by the grantee in performance of
the project. There typically is a requirement for the grantee to certify that the
approximate number of person-months or other activity called for in the grant was
performed. Payments are based on meeting specific requirements of the grant and
accountability is based primarily on technical performance and results.

### Grantee

The organization or other entity that receives a grant and assumes legal and
financial responsibility and accountability both for the awarded funds and for
the performance of the grant-supported activity. NSF grants are normally made
to organizations rather than to individual Principal Investigator/Project
Director(s). Categories of eligible proposers may be found in
[GPG Chapter I](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf08_1/gpg_1.jsp).

### Principal Investigator/Project Director (PI/PD)

The individual designated by the grantee, and approved by NSF, who will be
responsible for the scientific or technical direction of the project. If
more than one, the first one listed will have primary responsibility for
the project and the submission of reports. All others listed are considered
co-PI/PD, and share in the responsibility of the scientific or technical
direction of the project. The term "Principal Investigator" generally is
used in research projects, while the term "Project Director" generally is
used in science and engineering education and other projects. For purposes
of this Guide, PI/co-PI is interchangeable with PD/co-PD.
