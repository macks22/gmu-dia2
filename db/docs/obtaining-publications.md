## Overview

It will likely be useful to obtain additional publications for each
award in order to have additional textual information related to the
award. This will be useful for community detection via topic modelling
approaches, as well as to provide additional features or enrich existing
features for other purposes. 

## Methodology

The most immediately apparent way to do this
is to scrape the references from the NSF award listings. The NSF offers
a [search service at nsf.gov](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/). This
can also be accessed programatically with POST requests:

    curl -d "AWD_ID=0963183&HistoricalAwards=false" http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward

The result of this POST request is an HTML page with a listing of information
regarding the award. Most interesting for our purposes is a section at the
bottom titled: "PUBLICATIONS PRODUCED AS A RESULT OF THIS RESEARCH". This section
contains citations for papers that were published as a result of the research
funded by this particular award. This list of citations is not present in the XML
data for each award, so it will be necessary to scrape the HTML pages to obtain
the citations, then parse them into the relevant fields:

### Data Storage

#### Publication

    *********************************
    Field              Type
    *********************************
    id (PK)            int
    title              string
    journal            string
    volume             string (int?)
    pages              string
    year               int
    uri                string
    award_id (FK)      int
    *********************************

#### Author

    *********************************
    Field              Type
    *********************************
    person_id (FK)     int
    pub_id (FK)        int
    *********************************
    
#### Person

    *********************************
    Field              Type
    *********************************
    id (PK)            int
    fname              string
    lname              string
    middle_init        char
    email (unique)     string
    *********************************

#### Example

For example, the following publication listing is from the POST request above:

Yuwen Sun, Lucas F Wanner, Mani B Srivastava.
"Low-cost Estimation of Sub-system Power,"
Proceedings of the Third International Green Computing Conference (IGCC'12), 2012.

Shafiee, A., Brandenberg, S.J., and Stewart, J.P..
"Laboratory investigation of the cyclic and post-cyclic properties of Sherman Island peat,"
GeoCongress, San Diego, 2012.

Reinert, T., Brandenberg, S.J., Stewart, J.P., and Lemke, J..
"Remote monitoring of consolidation of peaty organic soil beneath a model levee,"
GeoCongress, San Diego, 2012.

Zainul M Charbiwala, Paul D Martin, Mani B Srivastava.
"CapMux: A Scalable Analog Front End for Low Power Compressed Sensing,"
Proceedings of the Third International Green Computing Conference (IGCC'12), 2012.

Reinert, E.T., Brandenberg, S.J., Stewart, J.P., and Moss, R.E.S..
"Dynamic field test of a model levee founded on peaty organic soil using an eccentric mass shaker,"
15th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering, Lisbon, Portugul, 2012.
    
The first of these would be parsed into the following record:

    Publication
    ************************************************************************************************
    Field              Value
    ************************************************************************************************
    id (PK)            0
    title              "Low-cost Estimation of Sub-system Power"
    journal            "Proceedings of the Third International Green Computing Conference (IGCC'12)"
    volume             NULL
    pages              NULL/ALL
    year               2012
    uri                NULL
    award_id (FK)      0963183
    ************************************************************************************************

This record would then be matched up with each person, and if the person does
not already exist in the db, he/she would be added, then matched as an author.
