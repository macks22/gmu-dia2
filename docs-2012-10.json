{"204314":{"abstract":"This project designs algorithms for the integration of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PEVs) into the power grid. Specifically, the project will formulate and solve optimization problems critical to various entities in the PEV ecosystem -- PEV owners, commercial charging station owners, aggregators, and distribution companies -- at the distribution \/ retail level. Charging at both commercial charging stations and at residences will be considered, for both the case when PEVs only function as loads, and the case when they can also function as sources, equipped with vehicle-to-home (V2H) or vehicle-to-grid (V2G) energy reinjection capability. The focus of the project is on distributed decision making by various individual players to achieve analytical system-level performance guarantees.<br\/><br\/>Electrification of the transportation market offers revenue growth for utility companies and automobile manufacturers, lower operational costs for consumers, and benefits to the environment. By addressing problems that will arise as PEVs impose extra load on the grid, and by solving challenges that currently impede the use of PEVs as distributed storage resources, this research will directly impact the society. The design principles gained will also be applicable to other cyber-physical infrastructural systems. A close collaboration with industrial partners will ground the research in real problems and ensure quick dissemination of results to the marketplace. A strong educational component will integrate the proposed research into the classroom to allow better training of both undergraduate and graduate students.

The ability to detect patterns in natural scenes serves critical biological needs while posing substantial computational difficulties for machine intelligence. Research on human and computer perception of pattern regularity has primarily focused on bilateral symmetry, despite a wide variety of regular patterns beyond reflection. A unique feature of the proposed project is to use symmetry group theory as an organizing principle for the study of both human and computer perception of patterns. Symmetry group theory, instantiated by its subgroup hierarchy, provides a formal and exhaustive categorization of all regular patterns. <br\/><br\/>The project sits at an interdisciplinary nexus between computer science, psychology, neuroscience, and mathematics. The outcomes of this research could potentially transform the theory of human pattern perception and make a quantum leap in robust automatic detection of real world regularities. Because patterns are ubiquitous, this research impacts all information processing systems challenged by large digital datasets that are hard to explore manually. Its impact is strengthened further by a systemic outreach to the respective research communities through interdisciplinary workshops, publications, data sharing, classroom lectures, postdoc and student training.

Software increasingly is used in safety-critical medical devices. Given the safety-critical nature of software controlling medical devices, regulatory agencies are endowed by the government with authority to allow only software meeting with high standards of quality to be put into use. For example, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibits a medical device from being marketed unless it can be reasonably trusted as safe and effective. Moreover, if a device on the market is reported to fail and cause health consequences to patients, the FDA has the right to take corrective actions, such as post-market reviews of the device to find the root cause of the failure. As medical device technology evolves, so does the software upon which the technology often relies. Changes in device software, after it has been approved or cleared by the FDA, may compromise the safety of that device. Assessing the safety of such changes presents special challenges to regulators at the FDA. To address these challenges in the context of regulation at the FDA, the research develops differential analysis techniques using the technology of dynamic symbolic execution to assess the effects of software changes on device safety. The research explores new techniques for addressing unique requirements and challenges posed by differential analysis in the context of FDA regulation. These techniques also advance the fundamental state of the art in differential analysis. Among the broader impacts of the project includes integration of the research into education programs and enhancement of teaching and research infrastructure.","title":"Differential Analysis on Changes in Medical Device Software","awardID":"1160603","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2014-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}}],"PIcoPI":["562727","549909"],"PO":["565255"]},"193391":{"abstract":"The motivation behind this research is to enable broader (and valid) usage of recent breakthroughs in the field of compressed sensing by improving the performance of sparse signal reconstruction algorithms. Compressed or sparse sensing is a new way to recover an analog signal (signal reconstruction) from a small number of measurements when the signal's support - points where the signal in question assumes nonzero values - is finite. Sparse signals are the counterpart to band-limited signals in conventional Nyquist sampling. What makes this approach so attractive is that the number of samples required to achieve \"perfect\" reconstruction is generally very small, and fast optimization algorithms can accomplish reconstruction. The first step in this research program will be to find ways to exploit prior knowledge about the nature of the support of the signal. The ultimate goal is to develop algorithmic approaches (theoretical\/practical) to aid practitioners in formulating realistic assumptions in applications ranging from wireless communications, machine learning, DNA micro arrays, and various problems arising in image reconstruction. <br\/><br\/>The research focus is on designing polynomial reconstruction algorithms that could provably bridge the gap between sparsity to measurement density ratios (S\/MDR) recoverable by the current state-of-the-art algorithms and the best possible situation where the S\/MDR approaches 1.

More broadly, the objective is to obtain theoretical guarantees on the performance quality (complexity, precision etc.) of certain practically feasible optimization algorithms.

To address growing societal challenges, the current reactive approach to medical practice, which is focused on disease management, must be transformed into a proactive approach that empowers individuals to manage their personal wellness. We propose a multi-disciplinary investigation into a novel systems framework that will empower individuals to adopt permanent lifestyle changes that result in sustained PWM.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: A goal-seeking systems framework that enables the integration of medical protocols and behavioral analysis protocols with emerging technologies and devices is developed in this project. The approach empowers individuals by (a) suggesting actions that they are most likely to perform, (b) ensuring that the resources required for the suggested actions are accessible, (c) reinforcing their desire to achieve the target consequences through incentives, and (d) enabling them to track their personal progress toward their target consequences. The goal-seeking framework seeks to find good-enough solutions and does not require a precise model of the underlying solution. As long as the measured consequences of the selected actions are within an acceptable tolerance limit, the decision-maker allows the system to evolve. The ability to tailor the tolerance limit to an individual, vary the limit over time, and incorporate humans in the decision-making loop all make the approach attractive.

Both commercial and open-source visualization tools offer a wealth of visualization techniques, enabling scientists to explore their data and generate individual images which capture key aspects of the subject under study. However, an important need of scientists - creating animations for storytelling - is not sufficiently supported. Scientists make extensive use of animation in the form of videos that explain complex structures or processes. Surprisingly, most visualization packages provide very limited support for making animations. The objectives of this project are to: (1) design an interactive animation interface seamlessly integrated with the visualization interface, and develop optimal strategies for controlling camera movement based on key-frames specified by the user; (2) create a prototype system to assess how well the proposed integrated interface enhances users' ability to create visualization animations for storytelling; and (3) through case studies and a user study, investigate whether animations created using the system effectively illustrate complex processes and spatial relationships.

In this light, this project addresses the following fundamental research questions: how do we expressively identify groups of entities based on predicates over individual entities' and groups' contexts, and how do we define, assess, and share the context of both individuals and groups?<br\/><br\/>This project diverges from existing work in its perspective on context and context-awareness. Existing work is largely ego-centric, focusing on how to use knowledge of a single entity's situation to impact its own personal, local behavior. As groups become a defining force of applications in domains as diverse as the Internet of Things, delay-tolerant networks, and intelligent transportation systems, the notion of a shared view of the context will be of primary importance. A second key differentiator is the project's focus on the quality of distributed knowledge about both context and group membership. Making these quality metrics available to applications is essential to enabling effective decision-making based on context information.<br\/><br\/>The project addresses issues surrounding context-awareness that pervade our everyday lives. In addition, the project includes an integrated impact plan that uses technology transfer to engage the public and evaluate the research.

These problems generally require dexterity, complex perception, and complex physical interaction. Yet, many such problems can be reliably addressed with human\/robot collaborative (HRC) systems, where one or more humans provide needed perception and adaptability, working with one or more robot systems that provide speed, precision, accuracy, and dexterity at an appropriate scale, combining these complementary capabilities.<br\/><br\/>The project focuses on multilateral manipulation, which arises when a human controls one or more robot manipulators in partnership with one or more additional controllers (humans or autonomous agents). Complex operations in surgery and manufacturing can benefit from the extra degrees of freedom provided by more than two hands, and training often depends on hands-on interaction between expert and apprentice. Example applications include surgical operations, which typically involve several physicians and assistants, and other medical tasks such as turning a patient in bed and wrapping a cast to constrain a hand. Multilateral manipulation also applies in manufacturing, for example for threading wires or cables, aligning gaskets to obtain a tight seal, and in many household situations, such as folding tablecloths, wrapping packages, and zipping overfilled suitcases so they will fit inside diabolically-designed overhead airline compartments. Multilateral manipulation often arises with deformable materials or multi-jointed objects with more than six degrees of freedom (DOF). The extra DOFs in materials introduce challenges such as computational complexity, but they also can accommodate minor inconsistencies through redundancy and provide system damping. This project advances the fundamental science of multilateral manipulation guided by specific applications from surgery and manufacturing.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Multilateral manipulation systems have the potential to improve healthcare, improve American competitiveness and product quality in manufacturing, and open the door to new service robot applications in the home. The project will be guided by an Advisory Board of experts from industry and medical practice. Project results will be disseminated through yearly conference workshops, open-source software tools integrated into common robotics software environments such as Robot Operating System (ROS), and the investigators' research and course webpages, to encourage integration of our approach into research projects and courses at many institutions. Outreach programs, public lab tours, and mentoring of minority students will broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering. These activities will encourage participation in STEM activities and provide student and postdoctoral researchers with mentoring experience.","title":"NRI-Large: Collaborative Research: Multilateral Manipulation by Human-Robot Collaborative Systems","awardID":"1227536","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2016-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8013","name":"National Robotics Initiative"}}],"PIcoPI":[520937,520938],"PO":["534411"]},"196462":{"abstract":"Continuous real-time tracking of the eye and field-of-view of an individual is profoundly important to understanding how humans perceive and interact with the physical world. This work advances both the technology and engineering of cyber-physical systems by designing an innovative paradigm involving next-generation computational eyeglasses that interact with a user's mobile phone to provide the capability for real-time visual context sensing and inference. This research integrates novel research into low-power embedded systems, image representation, image processing and machine learning, and mobile sensing and inference, to advance the state-of-art in continuous sensing for CPS applications. The activity addresses several fundamental research challenges including: 1) design of novel, highly integrated, computational eyeglasses for tracking eye movements, the visual field of a user, and head movement patterns, all in real-time; 2) a unified compressive signal processing framework that optimizes sensing and estimation, while enabling re-targeting of the device to perform a broad range of tasks depending on the needs of an application; 3) design of a novel real-time visual context sensing system that extracts high-level contexts of interest from compressed data representations; and 4) a layer of intelligence that combines contexts extracted from the computational eyeglass together with contexts obtained from the mobile phone to improve energy-efficiency and sensing accuracy.<br\/><br\/>This technology can revolutionize a range of disciplines including transportation, healthcare, behavioral science and market research. Continuous monitoring of the eye and field-of-view of an individual can enable detection of hazardous behaviors such as drowsiness while driving, mental health issues such as schizophrenia, addictive behavior and substance abuse, neurological disease progression, head injuries, and others. The research provides the foundations for such applications through the design of a prototype platform together with real-time sensor processing algorithms, and making these systems available through open source venues for broader use.

This approach addresses the problem of physiological monitoring today that requires skin contacts such as electrodes for ECG, and hence cannot scale to widespread monitoring of patients and healthy adults for years. The key challenge is to develop high-resolution sensing on low-power mobile platforms that can separate out the weak motion signals of heart and lung, from the gross motion of the body and the sensor. The project is developing theory and design for a compressive ultrawideband (UWB) RF sensor that achieves two orders of magnitude reduction in the required sampling rate to make it feasible to realize in a low-power mobile form factor. EasySense employs dynamic compressive sensing algorithms to improve the quality of sensing through temporal integration of information and employs interference subspace cancelation methods to cancel out motion artifacts using data obtained from accelerometers and gyroscopes. The project is implementing all the needed hardware, firmware, embedded software on the sensor node for sampling, processing, and wireless communication, and mobile phone software for data collection, storage, and visualization. EasySense is evaluated against traditional physiological sensors via lab and field studies on human subjects involving stress and exercise protocols.<br\/><br\/>By realizing contactless sensing of physiology in the field environment, EasySense will enable long-term physiological monitoring at large-scale that is essential for determining potential causes and early biomarkers of fatal diseases of slow accumulation such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases.

It also becomes possible to optimize the agents and their communications to improve performance. Cyber-physical systems (like robots, self-piloting aircraft, etc.) modify themselves to improve performance break those conditions in that some agent modules negotiate their own communications and decide their own actions, sometimes taking advantage of the physics of the world in ways we did not anticipate.

As many as 20% or more of all hospital admissions occur within 30 days of a previous discharge. Such rehospitalizations are not only expensive but are also potentially harmful, and most importantly, they are often preventable. Providing special care for a targeted group of patients who are at a high risk of rehospitalization can significantly improve the chances of avoiding rehospitalization. Estimating the predictive power of the clinical data collected during the hospitalization of a patient and effectively making predictions from such diverse patient records requires new analytical models. This project develops a 'rehospitalization analytics' framework that can identify, characterize and reduce the risks of rehospitalization for patients using a wide range of electronic health records. Specifically, the research objectives of this project are to develop: (i) integrated models that can effectively leverage multiple heterogeneous patient information sources and transfer the acquired knowledge about rehospitalization between different hospitals and patient groups in the presence of only few patient records, (ii) novel adaptable time-sensitive models that make predictions of the risk estimates in the presence of inherent concept drifts in the clinical data, and (iii) new regularization methods that can effectively extract the population-specific risk factors despite the presence of multiple correlations and grouped categorical clinical predictors. The methods are evaluated using heart failure patient records collected at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. The performance of the proposed models is compared against the state-of-the-art statistical and clinical tools that are currently applied for risk prediction.<br\/><br\/>This project aims to provide a comprehensive, accurate, and timely assessment of risk of rehospitalizations, and has the potential to direct more aggressive treatments towards specific high-risk patients. Predictive models developed in this project could be widely adopted and have nation-wide impact because the source data is often available at the hospitals. This has the potential to improve the lives of patients, by reducing exacerbations, and reducing overall health care costs by reducing the number of hospitalizations. The computational models developed in this project could also be applied to other chronic diseases that have high rates of utilization and could benefit from improved targeting of intervention\/resources.

While security is a phenomenon mediated by the technical workings of computers and networks, it is ultimately a conflict driven by economic and social issues that merit a commensurate level of scrutiny. Today's online attackers are commonly profit-seeking, and the implicit social networks that link them together play a critical role in fostering the innovation and the efficiency underlying cybercrime markets. Further, the socio-economic lens can provide vital insights not only for understanding attackers, but victims too. Today's consumers, corporations, and governments make large investments in security technology with little understanding of their ultimate return-on-investment. And the ease with which we adopt online personas and relationships has created a collective blind spot that attackers exploit all-too-easily.<br\/><br\/>Grappling with these socio-economic dimensions is of fundamental importance for achieving a secure future information infrastructure, and developing a sound understanding of them requires research grounded in empiricism. Accordingly, the project has four key components: (1) pursue in-depth empirical analyses of a range of online criminal activities; (2) map out the evolving attacker ecosystem that preys on online social networks, and the extent to which unsafe online behavior is itself adopted and transmitted; (3) study how relationships among these criminals are established, maintained, and evolve over time; and (4) measure the efficacy of today's security interventions, both in the large and at the level of individual users. Across all of these efforts, the aim is to identify bottleneck elements where interventions might most effectively undermine entire ecosystems of abusive and criminal activities. Consequently, this research has the potential to dramatically benefit society by undermining entire cybercrime ecosystems: disrupting underground activities, infrastructure, and social networks through strategic intervention. The work will also create numerous educational opportunities, including undergraduate and graduate education as well as workforce education for security professionals, law enforcement, civil regulatory agencies, and legal scholars and professionals tasked with countering modern Internet threats.","title":"TWC: Frontier: Collaborative: Beyond Technical Security: Developing an Empirical Basis for Socio-Economic Perspectives","awardID":"1237076","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2017-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"8060","name":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace"}}],"PIcoPI":["565195"],"PO":["565239"]},"189565":{"abstract":"Development in humans and other higher organisms creates complex,<br\/>precisely defined multicellular structures and patterns.

The demonstrator task is a canonical example of human-robot coexistence: sharing a refrigerator. The robot must be able to extract specified items from a refrigerator that may also be accessed and altered by humans. We will develop the beginnings of a solution based on the following principles: such manipulation tasks can be solved by a hierarchical two-level planning strategy, consisting of a high-level metaplanner making use of low-level primitives; the low-level primitives should include push-grasping, sweeping, and other nonprehensile actions that take advantage of mechanics to manipulate cluttered environments when simple grasp-and-carry is impeded; and uncertainty in the state of the environment and its physical properties should be accounted for at both the metaplanner and primitive levels.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Although not all outreach goals can be completed within the revised scope, cluttered tasks are critically important for an aging population of about 35 million people (one in eight) in the United States.

The PIs are developing a new approach to preventing coercion attacks using the concept of implicit learning from cognitive psychology. Implicit learning refers to learning of patterns without any conscious knowledge of the learned pattern. Using a carefully crafted keyboard-based computer game the PIs plant a secret password in the participant's brain without the participant having any conscious knowledge of the trained password. This planted secret can be used for authentication, but participants cannot be coerced into revealing their secret since they have no conscious knowledge of it. <br\/><br\/>This project explores three directions for using implicit learning in computer security. First, the PIs are developing implicit learning tasks designed to be used in challenge-response authentication. Second, the PIs are experimenting with methods to demonstrate implicit knowledge by measuring electrical activity along the scalp using off the shelf EEG devices. Third, the PIs are conducting user experiments to demonstrate that participants are able to properly authenticate, but cannot consciously recognize the trained secret. This project is a collaboration between computer security researchers and cognitive psychologists. Ultimately, the project aims to understand how the brain represents implicit knowledge. This in turn will lead to new coercion resistant security mechanisms for high-security applications.","title":"TWC: Medium: Collaborative: Neuroscience Meets Computer Security: Designing Systems Secure Against Coercion Attacks","awardID":"1228645","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2016-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"8060","name":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace"}}],"PIcoPI":["521488"],"PO":["565239"]},"200246":{"abstract":"This project supports a Future Internet Architecture (FIA) principal investigator meeting in October 2012.

These problems generally require dexterity, complex perception, and complex physical interaction. Yet, many such problems can be reliably addressed with human\/robot collaborative (HRC) systems, where one or more humans provide needed perception and adaptability, working with one or more robot systems that provide speed, precision, accuracy, and dexterity at an appropriate scale, combining these complementary capabilities.<br\/><br\/>The project focuses on multilateral manipulation, which arises when a human controls one or more robot manipulators in partnership with one or more additional controllers (humans or autonomous agents). Complex operations in surgery and manufacturing can benefit from the extra degrees of freedom provided by more than two hands, and training often depends on hands-on interaction between expert and apprentice. Example applications include surgical operations, which typically involve several physicians and assistants, and other medical tasks such as turning a patient in bed and wrapping a cast to constrain a hand. Multilateral manipulation also applies in manufacturing, for example for threading wires or cables, aligning gaskets to obtain a tight seal, and in many household situations, such as folding tablecloths, wrapping packages, and zipping overfilled suitcases so they will fit inside diabolically-designed overhead airline compartments. Multilateral manipulation often arises with deformable materials or multi-jointed objects with more than six degrees of freedom (DOF). The extra DOFs in materials introduce challenges such as computational complexity, but they also can accommodate minor inconsistencies through redundancy and provide system damping. This project advances the fundamental science of multilateral manipulation guided by specific applications from surgery and manufacturing.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Multilateral manipulation systems have the potential to improve healthcare, improve American competitiveness and product quality in manufacturing, and open the door to new service robot applications in the home. The project will be guided by an Advisory Board of experts from industry and medical practice. Project results will be disseminated through yearly conference workshops, open-source software tools integrated into common robotics software environments such as Robot Operating System (ROS), and the investigators' research and course webpages, to encourage integration of our approach into research projects and courses at many institutions. Outreach programs, public lab tours, and mentoring of minority students will broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering.

Such acoustic models may suffer from data sparsity and may fail to capture coarticulation appropriately because the span of a tri- or quin-phone's contextual influence is not flexible. In a small vocabulary context, however, research has shown that ASR systems which estimate articulatory gestures from the acoustics and incorporate these gestures in the ASR process can better model coarticulation and are more robust to noise. The current project investigates the use of estimated articulatory gestures in large vocabulary automatic speech recognition. Gestural representations of the speech signal are initially created from the acoustic waveform using the Task Dynamic model of speech production. These data are then used to train automatic models for articulatory gesture recognition where the articulatory gestures serve as subword units in the gesture-based ASR system. The main goal of the proposed work is to evaluate the performance of a large-vocabulary gesture-based ASR system using American English (AE). The gesture-based system will be compared to a set of competitive state-of-the-art recognition systems in term of word and phone recognition accuracies, both under clean and noisy acoustic background conditions.<br\/><br\/>The broad impact of this research is threefold: (1) the creation of a large vocabulary American English (AE) speech database containing acoustic waveforms and their articulatory representations, (2) the introduction of novel machine learning techniques to model articulatory representations from acoustic waveforms, and (3) the development of a large vocabulary ASR system that uses articulatory representation as subword units. The robust and accurate ASR system for AE resulting from the proposed project will deal effectively with speech variability, thereby significantly enhancing communication and collaboration between people and machines in AE, and with the promise to generalize the method to multiple languages.

It funds the planning of the technical and organizational aspects. To understand community requirements, it involves workshops and outreach to gather community requirements. <br\/><br\/>To fully understand the behavior of a complex physical phenomenon such as a burning building, it is often necessary to understand both large-scale effects such as the buildup of heat on each floor, and small-scale effects, such as how a steal beam in the foundation deforms as it gets hotter. Computational simulations that study such effects in tandem are called \"multi-scale\" simulations, and are exceedingly difficult to write. This is because the computational models that represent the different scales differ widely, and the software components used to simulate each scale are often incompatible. Combining these disparate components requires painstaking and error prone programmer labor.<br\/><br\/>This project will conceptualize an institute devoted to providing solutions to scientists investigating multi-scale problems. The project centers around reaching out to computational scientists and computer systems researchers to determine both what kinds of programming abstractions may be useful for different computational models and how to best adapt existing abstractions to the challenges of multi-scale simulation. The goal is to enable the establishment of an institute that will study the use of various programming abstractions to bridge the gap between differing software components, hence easing the pain of writing multi-scale simulations. The ultimate effect will be to allow multi-scale systems to be simulated accurately and efficiently, providing deeper insights into the behavior of complex physical systems.","title":"Collaborative Research: Conceptualizing an Institute for Using Inter-Domain Abstractions to Support Inter-Disciplinary Applications","awardID":"1216809","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2014-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"01","name":"Office of OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR                  ","abbr":"O\/D"},"div":{"id":"0111","name":"Office of CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"OCI"},"pgm":{"id":"8004","name":"Software Institutes"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2878","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CCF"}}],"PIcoPI":["562414","550995",517389,517390,"556631"],"PO":["565247"]},"193262":{"abstract":"Information retrieval (IR) systems are inherently temporal.

ICNet). The nation?s physical infrastructure is at increasing and critical risk from climate-driven stressors due to both ambient and periodic extremes in precipitation, temperature, and wind. Climate nonstationarity poses challenges that have been broadly recognized by the road and bridge engineering community. However, relatively few infrastructure researchers incorporate climate change into their work due to significant knowledge and data barriers. A network of collaborators in the transportation infrastructure research and practitioner community is essential to develop and maintain the capacity needed to keep pace with rapid advancements in climate modeling, error propagation and adaptation arenas. A distinctive part of the strategy is to build a knowledge resource using processes designed by our social science ICNet members to support knowledge-sharing and prioritization among ICNet researchers and to link that knowledge to the community of user institutions. This will be accomplished by (1) fostering collaboration among the infrastructure research and practitioner community who have the expertise to conduct this research, (2) identifying key questions and hypotheses, common data needs and standards required to generate and expand new research, (3) building and populating a knowledge commons that will serve as a web-based resource for the community, (4) strengthening the linkages between researchers and practitioner communities to successfully address adaptation challenges for a sustainable infrastructure in the future, and (5) developing and exploring the efficacy of processes of knowledge access and network development to improve technology transfer. The ICNet RCN will develop the institutional networks needed to accelerate research methods in climate change transportation infrastructure impacts and adaptation. It will also advance the science of sustainable engineering under emergent environmental conditions. The ICNet will topically address a concrete societal need to discover new ways to deal with uncertainties of planning for human systems in the environment of nonstationary natural and earth systems. A goal of the project is to develop science to build bridges and roads that will last longer in the future and require less money and energy to maintain. The knowledge-linking strategies that will be explored are designed to build conduits with societal institutions in New England that are responsible for long-range infrastructure adaptation standards and policies and demonstrate an approach transferable to other regions and adaptation problems. This will help maximize the benefits of the knowledge network and will also play a role in its own sustainability. The RCN will also provide opportunities for, and already reflects in its steering committee and participants, strong leadership of women in engineering, cultural diversity, and over 80% of the graduate degree granting Civil Engineering Departments in the region and will advance education in sustainable engineering at institutions with significant underrepresented groups in the region.","title":"RCN-SEES: Engineering Research Collaboratory for Sustainable Infrastructure in a Changing Climate","awardID":"1231326","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2016-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2878","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CCF"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0702","name":"Division of CHEM, BIOENG, ENV, &  TRANSP S","abbr":"CBET"},"pgm":{"id":"1664","name":"Research Coordination Networks"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0702","name":"Division of CHEM, BIOENG, ENV, &  TRANSP S","abbr":"CBET"},"pgm":{"id":"7231","name":"CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":[523369,523370,"431406",523372,523373],"PO":["565364"]},"193186":{"abstract":"This project addresses the challenge of making avatars used in tutoring systems and other learning technologies more engaging and more effective learning guides. One focus is on making the movements of an avatar more lifelike; a second focus is on understanding how to effectively integrate gestures indicating friendliness with gestures used for promoting concept learning. Design of avatar gestures draws on the literature on the roles of gesturing in communication, the literature on grounded and embodied cognition, and the literature on mathematics. The focus of this Cyberlearning: Transforming Education Exploration proposal is on designing avatar gestures for promoting learning of mathematical equivalence. Analysis of the effects of those gestures and extraction of preliminary guidelines for gesture design will lay the groundwork for extending gesturing capabilities of avatars across disciplinary content areas.

But learners can be put off by avatars that are emotionless, and avatars technology does not yet combine gesturing and \"talking\" in the way good tutors and teachers do as they are trying to help learners learn difficult concepts. This project addresses both of those issues -- giving avatars enough personality so that learners will engage with them more readily and willingly and giving avatars the capability of gesturing in ways that are congruent with the concepts they are expressing. There are a variety of challenges in addressing these issues, some technical, some social, and some cognitive. The project team is addressing all three types of issues, working towards design principles for avatars that move and engage more naturally and that can gesture as people do when explaining difficult content. Enhancing the interactions between computers and people in ways that promote both sustained engagement and learning will improve the effectiveness of intelligent tutoring systems and other learning technologies across disciplines and across the ages of learners.","title":"EXP: Collaborative Research: A System of Animation Gestures for Effective Teaching Avatars","awardID":"1216984","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2014-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8020","name":"Cyberlearning: Transforming Ed"}}],"PIcoPI":[517507],"PO":["562669"]},"198895":{"abstract":"The National Science Foundation (NSF) is pleased to announce the selection of Harvard University?s Robert Wood, an Associate Professor of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, to receive its 2012 Alan T.

This approach addresses the problem of physiological monitoring today that requires skin contacts such as electrodes for ECG, and hence cannot scale to widespread monitoring of patients and healthy adults for years. The key challenge is to develop high-resolution sensing on low-power mobile platforms that can separate out the weak motion signals of heart and lung, from the gross motion of the body and the sensor. The project is developing theory and design for a compressive ultrawideband (UWB) RF sensor that achieves two orders of magnitude reduction in the required sampling rate to make it feasible to realize in a low-power mobile form factor. EasySense employs dynamic compressive sensing algorithms to improve the quality of sensing through temporal integration of information and employs interference subspace cancelation methods to cancel out motion artifacts using data obtained from accelerometers and gyroscopes.

Such acoustic models may suffer from data sparsity and may fail to capture coarticulation appropriately because the span of a tri- or quin-phone's contextual influence is not flexible. In a small vocabulary context, however, research has shown that ASR systems which estimate articulatory gestures from the acoustics and incorporate these gestures in the ASR process can better model coarticulation and are more robust to noise. The current project investigates the use of estimated articulatory gestures in large vocabulary automatic speech recognition. Gestural representations of the speech signal are initially created from the acoustic waveform using the Task Dynamic model of speech production. These data are then used to train automatic models for articulatory gesture recognition where the articulatory gestures serve as subword units in the gesture-based ASR system. The main goal of the proposed work is to evaluate the performance of a large-vocabulary gesture-based ASR system using American English (AE). The gesture-based system will be compared to a set of competitive state-of-the-art recognition systems in term of word and phone recognition accuracies, both under clean and noisy acoustic background conditions.<br\/><br\/>The broad impact of this research is threefold: (1) the creation of a large vocabulary American English (AE) speech database containing acoustic waveforms and their articulatory representations, (2) the introduction of novel machine learning techniques to model articulatory representations from acoustic waveforms, and (3) the development of a large vocabulary ASR system that uses articulatory representation as subword units. The robust and accurate ASR system for AE resulting from the proposed project will deal effectively with speech variability, thereby significantly enhancing communication and collaboration between people and machines in AE, and with the promise to generalize the method to multiple languages. The knowledge gained and the systems developed will contribute to the broad application of articulatory features in speech processing, and will have the potential to transform the fields of ASR, speech-mediated person-machine interaction, and automatic translation among languages. The interdisciplinary collaboration will facilitate a cross-disciplinary learning environment for the participating faculty, researchers, graduate students and undergraduate students Thus, this collaboration will result in the broader impact of enhanced training in speech modeling and algorithm development.

To cope with this demand and provide high throughput and low latency to applications, wireless network protocols need to solve a fundamental problem: they need combat noise, interference from other nodes as well as exogenous sources, and channel fading. These factors cause wireless channel conditions to vary with time, making it<br\/>challenging to achieve high performance. This proposal posits that an ideal solution to this problem is to design a network architecture over a rateless code. In a rateless wireless network, the sender encodes data without any explicit estimation or adaptation, implicitly adapting to the vagaries introduced by noise, interference, or fading. The receiver processes data (symbols or bits) as it arrives, decoding it, until the message is received successfully.<br\/><br\/>The building block for any rateless network is a strong coding scheme, without which such a vision remains purely conceptual. This proposal introduces a novel rateless code for wireless channels, the spinal code, which uses a pseudorandom hash function over the message bits to produce pseudorandom bits that in turn can be mapped directly to a dense constellation for transmission or can be used along with the traditional physical layer. Effectively, the use of a hash function allows for low-complexity code design without loss of performance. The proposal develops Cortex, a rateless wireless network built atop spinal codes. The proposed work will lead to contributions in the following areas: protocols using spinal codes and algorithms for encoding and decoding them, theoretical results investigating the rates achievable using these algorithms, and an implementation and experimental evaluation of spinal codes and higher-layer protocols.<br\/><br\/>A good rateless system has the potential to achieve high performance under challenging conditions while also reducing the complexity of wireless architectures. Over the duration of this proposal, the PIs plan to interact closely with a few companies that have the ability to influence standards and build commercial systems using the proposed ideas. The education plan includes the introduction of rateless ideas into the undergraduate curriculum, particularly MIT's \"Introduction to EECS-II\" course (\\url{http:\/\/mit.edu\/6.02}), which introduces the excitement of CS\/EE by cutting across the layers, going from packets to bits to signals.

However, recent successes in commercial robots appear to foreshadow an explosion of promising robotic applications for individuals with disabilities. Not only can robots be tasked to assist with Activities of Daily Living (ADL) but they can also help individuals through rehabilitation exercises such that therapists and family members can provide assistance in other arenas. The major barrier is that, to date, most assistive robotic devices are not designed for children. And although robotic systems for rehabilitation can generally be used to record information about motor performance during active movements, these systems are not ideal for rehabilitation with respect to children. This causes a unique challenge for deploying such robotic devcies for this target demographic.<br\/><br\/>To overcome this barrier, state-of-the-art techniques must be created to facilitate the interaction necessary for robots to be useful for therapeutic rehabilitation with respect to children. Based on the fact that logically, animate playthings naturally engage children, the goal of this project is to fuse play and rehabilitation techniques using a robotic design to induce childrobot interaction that will be entertaining as well as effective for pediatric rehabilitation. Of importance within this proposed work are approaches that allow therapists to provide instruction to robots on rehabilitation tasks that can be remapped to play behaviors specific to the individual child. In addition, robots must have internal perception and inference algorithms that allow them to learn new play behaviors and incorporate them to evoke corresponding behaviors in the child.<br\/><br\/>Major research questions are (1) How can child play behavior most effectively be assessed and shared with an assistive robot, (2) How can this knowledge be captured and generalized into behaviors useful for rehabilitation and (3) What are the most effective robot interfaces for communicating these behaviors both to the therapist for evaluation and the child for directing movement.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: The objective of this research effort is to further rehabilitation techniques for children by developing and validating the core technologies needed to integrate therapy instruction with child-robot play interaction in order to improve pediatric rehabilitation. A principal goal of the research endeavor is to examine how evaluation of upper and\/or lower limb body movement can be achieved through robot observation and how different rehabilitation exercises can be recoded to allow the mapping of therapist instruction to play behaviors. The focus is on using human-centered capabilities to enable robots to assist in rehabilitation exercises, an ability that is increasingly needed, especially given the desire to have daily therapeutic activities performed safely and consistently in almost any home environment.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: The successful development of a framework that builds upon proven human-centered observation techniques has the ability to tremendously increase the capabilities of robots that interact with children in a safe and effective manner. The significance of the approach will be emphasized in terms of providing assistance for children with cerebral palsy, but the results of this effort could lay the basis for similar efforts for children with varying disabilities. The PIs plan to incorporate these approaches into courses designed for robotics and software engineering. In addition, the education plan will incorporate many of these ideas into a \"boot-camp\" workshop for underrepresented students. Undergraduate research projects and demonstrations to middle-school students are anticipated to inspire and encourage the next generation of engineers and scientists and acclimate them into a new robot-integrated world.","title":"NRI-Small: Robot Movement for Patient Improvement - Therapeutic Rehabilitation for Children with Disabilities","awardID":"1208287","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8013","name":"National Robotics Initiative"}}],"PIcoPI":[513203,"558854",513205],"PO":["565049"]},"193670":{"abstract":"This project focuses on how to reveal the whole from only partial measurements. Often, physical variables can only be incompletely measured. For example, the state-of-the-art techniques to record brain activity (multi-electrode recordings of local field potentials or fMRI measurements) give only a partial account of the activity patterns of large numbers of neurons. In the course of this project, Fritz Sommer, Ph.D., and his collaborators from the University of California, investigate and develop methods for recovering complex multi-dimensional data structure from incomplete measurements. In the general case, when measurements are made (or \"subsampled\") at a rate lower than a mathematical limit called the Nyquist limit, the original signal cannot be fully reconstructed. However, the recent theory of compressed sensing (CS) demonstrated that subsampling below the Nyquist limit can be lossless if the signal to be compressed has sparse structure. The established theory of CS explains when full recovery from incomplete measurements is possible and provides efficient algorithms for full data reconstruction. This result is extremely relevant because many important classes of sensor signals, such as natural images and sounds, have an approximately sparse structure.<br\/><br\/>The current project explores whether the principle of CS can allow reconstruction of data structure from measurements that subsample an unknown signal in an unknown fashion. Standard CS cannot reconstruct the signal in such situations because the algorithm requires knowledge of how the signal was subsampled and what its structure is. Dr. Sommer and his team plan to develop methods for data reconstruction that can be performed with the subsampled data alone. The idea is to combine CS, a principle about measuring a signal with sparse structure, with sparse coding (SC), a principle for learning efficient representations of signals with sparse structure. Preliminary results suggest that this combination of methods, called adaptive compressed sensing (ACS), can indeed \"learn\" the map for recovering the full data from the subsamples alone (Isely et al. 2011). The team will investigate under what conditions a similar result holds for the large class of real-world sensor data that are not exactly sparse but can be well-approximated by sparse representations. Also being developed are methods on how to draw inferences and make decisions based on incomplete measurements. In particular, a pilot investigation in collaboration with Dr. Bosco Tjan's lab at the University of Southern California will explore whether ACS can be applied to improve the decoding of fMRI data.","title":"RI: Small: Making sense of incomplete sensor data","awardID":"1219212","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7327","name":"CRCNS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":[518654],"PO":["564318"]},"193472":{"abstract":"High-throughput technology now allows measuring the activities and interactions of tens of thousands of molecules in the cell simultaneously, opening new doors to systems-level scientific exploration in biology. Advanced computational methods are in development to analyze the huge amount of data to extract patterns that represent knowledge and to construct predictive models that have the promise to determine the characteristics of an organism, such as cancer outcomes or plant growth phenotypes. To help achieve these goals, this project aims at developing efficient and effective computational algorithms and tools to integrate heterogeneous and noisy high-throughput data, and to analyze them in ways that treat genes as inter-connected rather than independent components of the cell. <br\/><br\/>Biological networks are mathematical models that describe the interactions among molecules in the cell and are critical to the modeling and understanding of complex biological systems. However, the large sizes and complexity of biological networks as well as the noisy and incomplete data pose critical challenges to network-based data analysis. To tackle these challenges, a practical and intuitive strategy is to analyze\/utilize such networks on the level of functional pathways, i.e., genes\/proteins involved in similar biological processes, which would significantly reduce the complexity of biological networks and improve the understanding of complex phenotypes. As the current knowledge of functional pathways is rather limited for most species, this project will develop a set of algorithms and software tools for fully automated discovery of dense subnetworks as candidate functional modules, and develop functional module-oriented algorithms for analyzing\/utilizing biological networks for several real applications. First, this project will develop algorithms to improve network quality and network module discovery using information embedded in network topology. For networked (e.g. protein-protein interaction) data, topology is utilized to improve edge reliability, and subsequently module discovery, using a novel topological similarity measurement based on random walks on graphs. For non-networked (e.g., transcriptomic) data, global network topology is utilized to construct an \"optimal\" network that enables fully automated module discovery without any user-specified parameters. Second, this research will develop computational methods to systematically investigate the relationship between network topology and biological functions, which is expected to advance the current understanding of the organizing principles of biological networks, and facilitate prioritizing genes in disease studies. Finally, this project proposes a novel Steiner tree based algorithm for identifying potential causal genes associated with cancer phenotypes, and a novel similarity metric to compare patients based on pathway\/subnetwork-level gene expression patterns, which can be easily combined with existing clustering\/classification algorithms for network-based prediction of cancer outcomes. <br\/><br\/>The final outputs of this project will include both bioinformatics tools for integrative data analysis and databases of biological knowledge discovered from different input datasets. These tools and resources will be made freely available on the web, which can be used by a broad range of researchers who are interested in bioinformatics algorithm development or applications. These tools and resources will be applied to study several biological processes of central interests to collaborators, who have committed to validate some of the computational predictions. These include identifying novel plant hormone response genes, predicting and characterizing DNA damage response genes, and predicting metastasis potentials for breast cancer patients, by integrating protein-protein interaction and transcriptomic data. This project will also contribute to the advancement of computing with the development of novel network link prediction and module discovery algorithms and network-constrained clustering\/classification methods that are expected to have immediate applications in other domains besides biological sciences. The activities undertaken as part of this research will be incorporated into several courses and will expand the educational and research opportunities available at the University of Texas at San Antonio, a minority-serving institute where the majority of undergraduates are from under-represented minorities, and is expected to increase the geographic and ethnic diversity and encourage the participation of minority groups in bioinformatics and computational biology research.","title":"III: Small: Topology-based approaches to integrated analysis of transcriptomic, protein interactomic and phenotypic data","awardID":"1218201","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0808","name":"Division of BIOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"DBI"},"pgm":{"id":"1165","name":"ADVANCES IN BIO INFORMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"7658","name":"PROCESSES STRUCS & INTEGRITY"}}],"PIcoPI":[518186],"PO":["565136"]},"193362":{"abstract":"Software developers create the software that society increasingly relies on, and in turn software developers rely on program analysis tools to help them create that software.

With increases in life expectancy leading to larger aging populations, there is growing need to make healthcare services available anywhere and anytime. In addition, healthcare costs rise significantly when diseases are identified at a later stage. Thus, early detection of diseases can potentially lead to better healthcare at lower costs. Achieving widely available healthcare and ensuring early detection of diseases require complex medical control systems to monitor the condition of the human body. However, unsafe operation of these medical device control systems and failures of medical device control can cause harmful physiological conditions and even life and safety hazards. Verifying patient safety under the operational control deployed in medical devices is critical. For example, infusion-pump control systems must prevent drug overdose. <br\/><br\/>The goal of this project is to develop spatio-temporal hybrid automata (STHA) formal modeling and analysis techniques for medical device control operations to verify patient safety. Specifically, this project focuses on three principal scientific challenges: formal modeling of control operations that can respond to time-varying physiological processes and to spatio-temporal variation of physiological parameters; characterizing aggregate effects of multiple medical devices operating simultaneously; and formal safety analysis of medical devices. This project involves collaboration between researchers at U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Arizona State University. The research results will contribute theoretical foundations for assurance of patient safety when using medical devices. The project will contribute technology for developing highly reliable medical devices and increase public confidence in their use, while enabling safer and cheaper healthcare.

This project explores a fundamentally new approach to malware detection that promises to be faster, more effective, and cheaper than current tools.<br\/><br\/>The evolution of malicious software, or malware, has seen increases in both malware's capabilities and sheer volume. Recent malware makes use of a number of sophisticated technologies including polymorphism, public key encryption, and peer-to-peer architectures. These advances are driven by significant resources put into malware development by both criminal enterprises and countries. Traditional malware detection tools rely on slow manual processes and the recent advances in malware have outrun the ability of existing tools to cope.<br\/><br\/>This project uses a new approach to the malware crisis that centers around constructive use of crowd-sourcing. The key insight is that the collection of machines on the Internet contains information that can be used to automatically classify software as either legitimate or malicious. This information includes not only the behavior of malware on individual machines but also the behavior of the aggregate population. For example, the aggregate statistics of how software propagates across the network can provide insight into whether the software is malicious.<br\/><br\/>A key component of the proposed work is binary translation-based dynamic signatures. Traditional malware detection tools have used static signatures, but polymorphic techniques have made this approach significantly more difficult.

This hierarchical structure is critical to humans' unique ability to tackle complex, large-scale tasks, since it allows such tasks to be decomposed or broken down into more manageable parts. While some progress has been made toward understanding the origins and mechanisms of hierarchical behavior, key questions remain: How are task-subtask-action hierarchies initially assembled through learning? How does learning operate within such hierarchies, allowing adaptive hierarchical behavior to take shape? How do the relevant learning and action-selection processes play out in neural hardware? <br\/><br\/>To pursue these questions, the present proposal will leverage ideas emerging from the computational framework of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). HRL builds on a highly successful machine-learning paradigm known as reinforcement learning (RL), extending it to include task-subtask-action hierarchies. Recent neuroscience and behavioral research has suggested that standard RL mechanisms may be directly relevant to reward-based learning in humans and animals. The present proposal hypothesizes that the mechanisms introduced in computational HRL may be similarly relevant, providing insight into the cognitive and neural underpinnings of hierarchical behavior. <br\/><br\/>The project brings together two computational cognitive neuroscientists and a computer scientist with expertise in machine learning. The proposed research, which includes both computational modeling and human functional neuroimaging and behavioral studies, pursues a set of hypotheses drawn directly from HRL research. A first set of hypotheses relates to the question of how complex tasks are decomposed into manageable subtasks. Here, fMRI and computational work will leverage the idea, drawn from HRL research, that useful decompositions \"carve\" tasks at points identifiable through graph-theoretic measures of centrality. A second set of hypotheses relates to the question of how learning occurs within hierarchies. Here, fMRI and modeling work will pursue the idea that hierarchical learning may be driven by reward prediction errors akin to those arising within the HRL framework. The project as a whole aims to construct a biologically constrained neural network model, translating computational HRL into an account of how the brain supports hierarchically structured behavior.","title":"CRCNS: Collaborative Research: Neural Correlates of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning","awardID":"1207833","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7327","name":"CRCNS"}}],"PIcoPI":[513006,513007],"PO":["564318"]},"200216":{"abstract":"This project explores process composition tools as applied to elections, concentrating particularly on mail-in and Internet voting.

Most existing models in this regime rely heavily on parametric assumptions where the components of the model are typically assumed to be discrete or multivariate Gaussian, or the relations between variables are linear, which may be very different from the actual data generating processes. Furthermore, existing algorithms for discovering the latent dependency structures and learning the latent parameters largely are restricted to local search heuristics such as expectation maximization. Conclusions inferred under these restricted assumptions and suboptimal solutions can be misleading, if the underlying assumptions are violated or if the suboptimal solutions differ greatly from the globally optimal ones. This project aims to develop a novel framework which can (i) discover and take advantage of latent structures in the data, while (ii) allowing parts to handle near-arbitrary distributions, and (iii) allowing the models to scale to modern massive datasets in a local-minimum-free fashion. <br\/><br\/>The key innovation in the project is a novel nonparametric latent variable modeling framework based on kernel embedding of distributions. The basic idea is to map distributions into infinite dimensional feature spaces using kernels, such that subsequent comparisons and manipulations of distributions can be achieved via feature space operations, such as inner products, distances, projections, linear transformations and spectral analysis. Conceptually, the framework represents components from latent variable models, such as marginal distributions over a single variable, joint distributions over variable pairs, triplets and more variables, as infinite dimensional vectors, matrices, tensors and high-order tensors respectively. Probabilistic relations between these components, i.e., conditional distributions, Sum Rule, Product Rule etc. become linear transformations and relations between these feature space components.<br\/><br\/>The framework supports modeling data with diverse statistical features without the need for making restrictive assumptions about the type of distributions and relations. It supports the application of a large pool of linear and multi-linear algebraic (tensor) tools for addressing challenging graphical model problems in the presence of latent variables, including structure discovery, inference, parameter learning and latent feature extraction. The framework applies not only to general continuous variables, but also to variables that take values on strings, graphs, groups, compact manifolds, and other domains on which kernels may be defined.<br\/><br\/>Besides advancing the state of the art in machine learning,the new non-parametric methods resulting from the project find applications in image data and understanding and gene expression data analysis.

BSN technology is rapidly moving from the domain of research prototypes to commercial healthcare applications, with associated safety implications. However, because of a lack of an accepted definition of safety for BSNs and associated techniques for specifying and verifying their safety properties, manufacturers do not have guidelines for how to design BSNs to meet safety specifications, and the FDA (the primary regulatory body for these systems) is handicapped in their ability to evaluate BSNs to determine their suitability for the healthcare market. The regulatory problem is compounded by the nature of BSNs: wireless sensing, computing, and communicating devices operating in a coordinated manner to provide vital information about the physical state of a person. This project explores: (1) the development of a definition of safety properties for BSNs in light of their mobile, cyber-physical nature; (2) the development of a reference model for BSNs (termed the \"generic BSN\") from which specific BSN designs can be specified and instantiated and which lends itself to analysis techniques for extracting and formally verifying the instantiated design against identified safety properties.

The proposed research will address the algorithmic and device-level challenges that arise in the design of soft compliant robots capable of pose-invariant and shape-invariant grasping.

With the influx of new details about the higher-level structure and dynamics of the genome, novel techniques will be required to visualize and model the full extent of genomic interactions to gain insight about genome functions. Current genome browsers are specifically aimed at viewing primary sequence information. Although supplemental information can be annotated via new tracks, representing structural hierarchies and interactions is quite difficult in these browsers, particularly across non-contiguous genomic segments. In addition, in spite of many recent efforts to measure and model the genome structure at various resolutions and detail, little work has focused on combining these models or taken advantage of the large amount of genomic and epigenomic data generated from new high-throughput approaches. To address these issues, the team has created a proof-of-concept interactive 3D viewer, Genome3D, to enable integration and visualization of genomic and epigenomic data in three dimension. Substantial development is needed to take advantage of the newest genomic technologies and to enable its integration with analysis pipelines. While enormous amount of spatial information for eukaryotic chromosomes have been generated, the size and complexity of these data require the design and development of new algorithms and methods in data integration and model construction.

Such interoperable informatics would be transformational for our understanding of biology, with consequent impact on environmental and conservation policy. Adding to the transformational potential is the fact that the microbial world represents half of the world's biomass and nearly all of its biodiversity, yet is still effectively invisible and intractable to traditional biodiversity research. Metagenomic data are not amenable to the concepts, standards, semantics, and methods of traditional eukaryotic biodiversity, and therefore, require an alternate informatics framework.<br\/><br\/>The EAGER will transform the collaborations between two previously separate research communities: the informaticists of the traditional biodiversity community, who employ the Darwin Core (DwC) as a standard, and the informaticists of the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC), who have developed the Minimal Information about any Sequence (MIxS) standard for genomics, metagenomics and marker genes. Together, these groups will engage in a unified informatics effort to develop three layers of interoperability. The EAGER will harmonize the observational (DwC) and genomic (MIxS) standards, building on a community dialogue and interdisciplinary networking hosted and established under an NSF Research Coordination Network. Standards interoperability is the basis for the next two layers. Syntactic interoperability (in the context of Internet APIs and a database Reference Model) will be supported. The EAGER will assemble experts from the two communities to (a) devise a database Reference Model that integrates the DwC and GSC MIxS standards; and (b) for effective data management, create specific implementations for different database platforms to foster adoption. The practical implementation of the reference model on\/for different database systems will allow, for the first time, systematic comparative testing of technical performance and of use cases (e.g., which implementation best serves which complex data query). The EAGER will create task groups to establish the infrastructure for managing ontologies, and to construct a reference model on the purely semantic level in order to fuse the two worlds of data standards, both of which are advanced enough to engage in useful interoperability.<br\/><br\/>In developing an interdisciplinary information infrastructure to achieve data interoperability across domains, this EAGER would advance understanding of complex environmental phenomena and, thereby, inform future policy decisions.

The system addresses the auditory and visual senses with equal priority, which is currently only championed by head-mounted display systems. Unlike the latter, this system also enables direct communication between participants without the need for telecommunication devices. The system?s haptic floor display can be used to recreate floor vibrations (e.g., simulate concert stages) with an accuracy that is currently only known for smaller displays (e.g., car simulators).<br\/><br\/>The work addresses the need for specialized virtual reality (VR) system for the study and enablement of communication-driven tasks with groups of users immersed in a high-fidelity multi-modal environment located in the same physical space. While current multi-modal VR systems have achieved a high degree of realism, they either focus on the immersion of a single or very small group of users or on presenting material to a larger group of users in a cinema-type environment. In both cases, the systems provide homogeneous visual and acoustic fields. For group communication tasks, inhomogeneous fields that provide personalized visual and acoustic perspectives or each user, could provide better access to relevant information from the VR system?s display and at the same time increase the experiential degree of presence and perceived realism for interactive tasks. The project addresses the technical hurdles that need to be surmounted to establish a large-scale (18mx12mx4.3m), muti-user, muti-perspective, muti-model display. For visual domain, multiple point-of-convergence rendering techniques will be used to (re-)create scenes on a 7-projector display.. For the acoustic domain, a 192-loudspeaker-channel system will be designed for Wave-Field Synthesis (WFS) with the support of Higher-Order-Ambisonic (HoA) sound projection to render inhomogeneous acoustic fields. A haptic display, consisting of 16 platforms elements, will be used to simulate floor vibrations and also to provide infrastructure for other vibrating objects (e.g., handheld devices). An intelligent position-tracking system estimates current user positions and head orientations as well as positioning data for other objects. For the tracking system, a hybrid visual\/acoustic sensor system will be used to emulate the human activity of extracting robust information by relying on different modalities.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: <br\/>With new tools to study human perception, the system will enable research to explore new multi-modal, multi-user data displays that strategically utilize human ability to integrate cross-model sensory information. It will also serve as a platform to study interactions between humans and humanoid intelligent systems that can simulate environments at different degrees of complexity. The instrumentation supports research that will include the development of new interfaces for people with disabilities.

A sustainable energy system - one that uses renewable, low-carbon, affordable, and local energy sources - may be decades away. Natural gas is seen as the \"bridge fuel\" to a more sustainable energy system because natural gas combustion emits smaller amounts of greenhouse gases than coal combustion. However, conflicts have arisen between accelerated natural gas development and water and air resources protection. These conflicts are becoming acute in the Rocky Mountain region, which has always played an important role in the energy system of the United States. Most of the recent growth in natural gas production is the result of extracting gas from \"unconventional\" sources (coal-bed methane, shale gas, tight gas) with the techniques of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing requires large volumes of water that are chemically amended and injected to increase the permeability of the gas-bearing formations. The fracturing fluid left in ground and the fracturing fluid that returns to the surface (flowback), along with produced water, present risks to ground and surface waters. Natural gas extraction results in atmospheric emissions, particularly the release of greenhouse gases, oxides of nitrogen, and volatile organic compounds tied to the generation of ozone. These stresses on local water and air resources must be weighed against the benefits of natural gas production for the nation and the public must be provided with reliable information to make decisions about energy sources and resource protection. This Sustainability Research Network (SRN) addresses the conflict between natural gas extraction and water and air resources protection with the development of a social-ecological system framework with which to assess the conflict and to identify needs for scientific information. Scientific investigations will be conducted to assess and mitigate the problems. Outreach and education efforts will focus on citizen science, public involvement, and awareness of the science and policy issues. <br\/>The intellectual merit of this SRN proposal includes (1) examination of the effects of natural gas development on water and air resources by analyzing trade-offs between local, regional, and national costs and benefits in environmental, social, and economic domains (social-ecological systems); (2) review of industry practices for hydraulic fracturing, well drilling and casing, and gas collection infrastructure for best management practices recommendations (natural gas infrastructure); (3) investigation of the hydrologic processes that determine impacts of natural gas extraction on groundwater withdrawal and contaminant transport in drinking water aquifers and surface waters (water quantity); (4) characterization of the potential risks of fracturing fluid migrating to drinking water aquifers, the injection or discharge of flowback and produced water, and the mitigation of these risks by treatment of the flowback and produced waters (water quality); (5) improved spatial and temporal monitoring of air pollutants by a combination of high-resolution mobile sampling and the use of personal air monitors as an example of \"citizen science\" feeding data to air quality models that assess the local, regional, and national implications of natural gas development (air quality); and (6) quantitative and qualitative assessment of the health risks, both chemical and non-chemical, associated with water and air exposure. <br\/>The broader impact of this SRN includes improved public understanding of the effects of natural gas development on water and air resources and better decision-making regarding the local effects and regional and national benefits and costs of natural gas development. The broader impacts will be achieved through extensive education and outreach activities: (1) dissemination of best management practices in collaboration with all stakeholders, (2) diverse communication about scientists and scientific activity that will reach a broad portion of the public, (3) collaboration with Native American tribes and other under-represented groups disproportionately affected by natural gas development, (4) educational efforts aimed at providing appreciation for the science-policy interface at the university and K-12 levels, and (5) engagement of the public through citizen science, workshops, and scenario planning.","title":"Routes to Sustainability for Natural Gas Development and Water and Air Resources in the Rocky Mountain Region","awardID":"1240584","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2017-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0309","name":"Division of CHEMISTRY","abbr":"CHE"},"pgm":{"id":"1991","name":"CHEMISTRY PROJECTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2878","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CCF"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0702","name":"Division of CHEM, BIOENG, ENV, &  TRANSP S","abbr":"CBET"},"pgm":{"id":"8024","name":"Sustainability Resrch Networks"}}],"PIcoPI":[527834,"529656",527836,527837,527838],"PO":["565364"]},"196532":{"abstract":"This project demonstrates the synergistic use of a cyber-physical infrastructure consisting of smart-phone devices; cloud computing, wireless communication, and intelligent transportation systems to manage vehicles in the complex urban network -- through the use of traffic controls, route advisories and road pricing -- to jointly optimize drivers' mobility and the sustainability goals of reducing energy usage and improving air quality. The system developed, MIDAS-CPS, proactively manages the interacting traffic demand and the available transportation supply.

Finding the reconstruction is usually modeled as an optimization problem, whose optimal solution is intended to correspond to the correct reconstruction. A key ingredient in such a model is the criterion that is being optimized, which is captured by the objective function. This function often has many free parameters, and the choice of values for these parameters critically affects whether the correct reconstruction is actually an optimal solution. This project will build a general software system that solves two complementary problems: (1) parameter inference, which learns optimal values for the parameters of the objective function for classes of inputs, given examples of correct reconstructions; and (2) parameter advising, which recommends good values of the parameters for a specific input. Consider a developer and a user of a software tool that solves a reconstruction problem: parameter inference finds the best default values for the tool developer, while parameter advising finds good specific values for the particular input being run by the tool user.<br\/><br\/>Parameter inference will be tackled via a recent algorithmic breakthrough in inverse parametric optimization. Given examples of input-output pairs for a reconstruction problem, values for the parameters of the objective function that make each output be an optimal solution for its input can be found in polynomial time, as long as: (a) the objective function is linear in the parameters, and (b) the reconstruction problem is efficiently solvable when parameter values are fixed. Parameter advising will be tackled by: (1) learning a polynomial that combines feature functions into an estimator for the accuracy of a reconstruction, and (2) selecting the parameter value from a set of choices that yields the reconstruction of highest estimated accuracy. An optimal parameter set that maximizes the average true accuracy of the advisor will be found by integer linear programming.<br\/><br\/>The general software system for parameter inference and advising will be made freely available for researchers as open source through the Internet.

The tools developed by the project are poised to have very broad impact throughout computer science, not just computational biology, as the most widely-used optimization models, such as shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, maximum matchings, and network flow, all have linear objective functions, to which the parameter inference techniques apply.","title":"III: Small: Parameter Inference and Parameter Advising in Computational Biology","awardID":"1217886","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["560602"],"PO":["565136"]},"198721":{"abstract":"Cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Cornell Red Cloud, and the SDSC Storage Cloud have emerged as important research computing resources.

This work focuses on modeling, fabrication and applications for spin torque oscillators (STOs), with an emphasis on nano-arrays. Using multiferroic materials and an electric field, the team will tune both the frequency of a spin torque oscillator and also the coupling between adjacent STOs. This electric field will change the coercive field of the free layer which, in turn, will adjust the precessional frequency of the STO and the coupling between STOs. When presented with a continuous stream of real-time disparate data records that could come from different types of environmental and\/or biological sensors an STO array can extract knowledge by analyzing the stream and providing a degree of match information about various data instances in the stream and their class membership. The associative memory capabilities of STO arrays are agnostic to the source of data, thus they can be used for computation and composition of data streams from hybrid sources working in different modes of operation. This special form of machine learning can be done in real time with no need for excessive local buffering of data. It can also accommodate concept drift as the underlying statistics used for data mining can easily be changed over time by controlling the inputs to the individual STOs. Such applications as real-time data stream mining as enabled by the proposed technology are critical to the safety and security of the country. <br\/><br\/>The multidisciplinary activities exploit fundamental nanoelectronics and spintronics concepts through contributions in materials science, circuit design and novel nano-computing paradigms.

State-of-the-art artificial devices are far from exhibiting such autonomous learning abilities. This project focuses on a subset of the skills required for autonomous learning, specifically, the ability to identify the relevant cues and stimuli from the environment and establish how to act in their presence. In many situations, such as speech processing, this problem amounts to extracting temporally extended segments embedded in a continuous sensory stream of irrelevant stimuli and noise, a problem of temporal stimulus segmentation. Traditional algorithms for stimulus segmentation that learn based just on the unsegmented input stream are unlikely to succeed in this task, especially if the relevant segments do not exhibit features that are detectable by some standard pre-processing strategy. As a consequence, existing models typically endow a learning agent with prior knowledge of what is relevant (the so-called \"states\" of the agent) and focus on the problem of relating each state with the outcome they predict. Such models, of widespread use in computational neuroscience and machine learning, are unable to form or modify their own relevant states, preventing the development of truly autonomous learning and decision-making devices.<br\/><br\/>This project aims to develop a biologically relevant solution to the problem of temporal stimulus segmentation, with a focus on foundational theory and principles. In this theory, the states are represented by spatio-temporal patterns of spike trains and are processed by a network of spiking neurons capable of online, spike-based learning. The network learns to segment the input stream by taking appropriate actions at the right time, using a spike-based synaptic plasticity rule that approximates gradient ascent on the average reward, and makes use of locally available information about the network's decision. Importantly, the relevant segments are constructed so as to be behaviorally meaningful but not statistically different from irrelevant stimuli and noise, and therefore their boundaries are not detectable by standard pre-processing techniques.<br\/><br\/>Segmentation performance will be quantified as a function of the network's properties (such as number of neurons, connectivity and architecture) in the framework of different neurobiologically-inspired stimulus-coding schemes, and contrasted to more traditional approaches such as artificial neural networks and hidden Markov models. The research will be further enhanced by developing a hard challenge application related to natural stimuli, with the long-term goal of demonstrating the power and usefulness of the new approach compared to more traditional ones. This will also demonstrate that the network can be applied widely, across modalities (e.g., vision as well as speech), and in real-life scenarios.","title":"Temporal Stimulus Segmentation with Spiking Neurons","awardID":"1161852","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}}],"PIcoPI":[508235],"PO":["564318"]},"189669":{"abstract":"The PIs' goal in this research is to realistically display terrain in an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) locomotion interface, based upon modification of the foot\/terrain interaction coupled with graphical and auditory display of the terrain and user interaction.

Many in the CS community hypothesize that the absence of a computer and the social of the Unplugged activities make CS Unplugged especially engaging for female and under-represented minority students who tend to have less experience and confidence with computing concepts. But what is the impact of Unplugged on students? Using pre- and post-surveys and learning assessments the project team will explore a number of questions to assess the impact of Unplugged activities on students. For example, does participation in CS Unplugged activities actually have a positive impact on students' interest (especially women and underrepresented minorities) in pursuing computing as a major or career? Can exposure to CS concepts in a more accessible format (i.e., with no computers) increase students' confidence that they are able to learn the fundamentals required to continue in the field? In addition to evaluating the impact on students, the project team will explore how to effectively incorporate CS Unplugged activities in a middle-school classroom, and how to encourage middle school teachers to include CS Unplugged activities and CS concepts in their classroom instruction.<br\/><br\/>Many K-12 school students have had limited exposure to computing concepts, and therefore, have a very poor understanding of what computing education and careers involve.

CS Unplugged activities involve problem solving to achieve a goal, and engage students via kinesthetic activities, games, magic tricks, and competitions.

First, in the last decade, there has been a huge growth in understanding of the varied biological roles and properties of RNA. Second, there has been recent, yet still limited, progress on experimentally determining new RNA structures and dynamics. Finally, and most central to this project, there have been recent theoretical and practical advances in the time and space-efficiency of solutions to classic problems of RNA structure prediction. This also points to the fact that additional powerful algorithmic techniques developed in the computer science community have not been fully exploited (or in some cases ever applied) to problems of RNA structure prediction.

One focus is on making the movements of an avatar more lifelike; a second focus is on understanding how to effectively integrate gestures indicating friendliness with gestures used for promoting concept learning. Design of avatar gestures draws on the literature on the roles of gesturing in communication, the literature on grounded and embodied cognition, and the literature on mathematics. The focus of this Cyberlearning: Transforming Education Exploration proposal is on designing avatar gestures for promoting learning of mathematical equivalence. Analysis of the effects of those gestures and extraction of preliminary guidelines for gesture design will lay the groundwork for extending gesturing capabilities of avatars across disciplinary content areas. Research focuses on how to automatically animate an avatar with life-like qualities and the conditions under which adding gestures to a teaching avatar promotes engagement and learning.<br\/><br\/>Avatars are used extensively in learning technologies to guide learners' actions and to provide advice. But learners can be put off by avatars that are emotionless, and avatars technology does not yet combine gesturing and \"talking\" in the way good tutors and teachers do as they are trying to help learners learn difficult concepts. This project addresses both of those issues -- giving avatars enough personality so that learners will engage with them more readily and willingly and giving avatars the capability of gesturing in ways that are congruent with the concepts they are expressing. There are a variety of challenges in addressing these issues, some technical, some social, and some cognitive. The project team is addressing all three types of issues, working towards design principles for avatars that move and engage more naturally and that can gesture as people do when explaining difficult content. Enhancing the interactions between computers and people in ways that promote both sustained engagement and learning will improve the effectiveness of intelligent tutoring systems and other learning technologies across disciplines and across the ages of learners.","title":"EXP: Collaborative Research: A System of Animation Gestures for Effective Teaching Avatars","awardID":"1217215","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2014-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8020","name":"Cyberlearning: Transforming Ed"}}],"PIcoPI":[517654,517655],"PO":["562669"]},"193486":{"abstract":"Many modern applications ranging from computer vision to biology require modeling and inferring high-dimensional continuous variables based on distributions with multimodality, skewness, and rich latent structures. Most existing models in this regime rely heavily on parametric assumptions where the components of the model are typically assumed to be discrete or multivariate Gaussian, or the relations between variables are linear, which may be very different from the actual data generating processes. Furthermore, existing algorithms for discovering the latent dependency structures and learning the latent parameters largely are restricted to local search heuristics such as expectation maximization. Conclusions inferred under these restricted assumptions and suboptimal solutions can be misleading, if the underlying assumptions are violated or if the suboptimal solutions differ greatly from the globally optimal ones. This project aims to develop a novel framework which can (i) discover and take advantage of latent structures in the data, while (ii) allowing parts to handle near-arbitrary distributions, and (iii) allowing the models to scale to modern massive datasets in a local-minimum-free fashion. <br\/><br\/>The key innovation in the project is a novel nonparametric latent variable modeling framework based on kernel embedding of distributions. The basic idea is to map distributions into infinite dimensional feature spaces using kernels, such that subsequent comparisons and manipulations of distributions can be achieved via feature space operations, such as inner products, distances, projections, linear transformations and spectral analysis. Conceptually, the framework represents components from latent variable models, such as marginal distributions over a single variable, joint distributions over variable pairs, triplets and more variables, as infinite dimensional vectors, matrices, tensors and high-order tensors respectively. Probabilistic relations between these components, i.e., conditional distributions, Sum Rule, Product Rule etc. become linear transformations and relations between these feature space components.<br\/><br\/>The framework supports modeling data with diverse statistical features without the need for making restrictive assumptions about the type of distributions and relations. It supports the application of a large pool of linear and multi-linear algebraic (tensor) tools for addressing challenging graphical model problems in the presence of latent variables, including structure discovery, inference, parameter learning and latent feature extraction. The framework applies not only to general continuous variables, but also to variables that take values on strings, graphs, groups, compact manifolds, and other domains on which kernels may be defined.<br\/><br\/>Besides advancing the state of the art in machine learning,the new non-parametric methods resulting from the project find applications in image data and understanding and gene expression data analysis. It also contributes to research-based training of graduate and undergraduate students at Georgia Tech and CMU.","title":"III: Small: Collaborative Research: Efficient, Nonparametric and Local-Minimum-Free Latent Variable Models: With Application to Large-Scale Computer Vision and Genomics","awardID":"1218282","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":[518220],"PO":["565136"]},"196522":{"abstract":"This project aims to achieve key technology, infrastructure, and<br\/>regulatory science advances for next generation medical systems based<br\/>on the concept of medical application platforms (MAPs).

We investigate how such Software-Defined Buildings can be founded on a flexible, multi-service and open Building Integrated Operating System (BIOS) that allows applications to run reliably in safe, sandboxed environments. It supports sensor and actuator access, access management, metadata, archiving, and discovery, as well as multiple simultaneously executing programs.

People act with purpose: that is, they make sequences of decisions to achieve long-term objectives. For instance, in driving from home to a store, people carefully plan a sequence of roads that will get them there efficiently. In predicting a person's next decision, algorithms must be developed that reflect these purposeful actions. <br\/><br\/>Currently, robots are unable to anticipate human needs and goals, and this represents a fundamental barrier to their large-scale deployment in the home and workplace. The aim of this project is to develop a new science of purposeful prediction that can be applied to human-robot interaction across a wide variety of domains. The work draws on recent techniques based on Inverse Optimal Control and Inverse Equilibria Theory that enable statistically sound reasoning about observed deliberate behavior. These new methods provide the foundations of a theoretical framework that integrates traditional decision making techniques like optimal control, search and planning with probabilistic methods that reason about uncertainty and hidden information, particularly about goals, utility and intent. <br\/><br\/>Intellectual merit: The project will provide a general framework that allows robots to anticipate and adapt to the activities of their human co-workers based on perceptual cues. The investigators will develop the theory, a computational toolbox, and, in collaboration with industrial partners, prototype deployments of these new methods for the prediction of peoples' behavior in a diverse set of robotics domains from computer vision to motor control. The project is transformative in that it combines a novel theoretical\/algorithmic framework with extensive support in terms of volume of data and validation infrastructure in the context of many applications. <br\/><br\/>Broader impacts: A revolution in personal robotics in both the home and workplace depends on the ability to forecast human activities and intents; small- and medium- scale manufacturing will make a leap forward through agile robotic systems intelligent enough to understand and assist their co-workers in flexible assembly tasks; and robust models of pedestrian and vehicular traffic flow will enable more effective driver warning systems and safer autonomous mobile robots. Purposeful prediction technology is an important step towards enabling such understanding of actions and intents in these arenas.

The 3D kinematic feedback leads to more accurate diagnosis and faster progression. Unfortunately the current state of the art for technology to measure 3D motion is expensive, cumbersome, and not widely available to physical therapists.

While security is a phenomenon mediated by the technical workings of computers and networks, it is ultimately a conflict driven by economic and social issues that merit a commensurate level of scrutiny. Today's online attackers are commonly profit-seeking, and the implicit social networks that link them together play a critical role in fostering the innovation and the efficiency underlying cybercrime markets. Further, the socio-economic lens can provide vital insights not only for understanding attackers, but victims too. Today's consumers, corporations, and governments make large investments in security technology with little understanding of their ultimate return-on-investment. And the ease with which we adopt online personas and relationships has created a collective blind spot that attackers exploit all-too-easily.<br\/><br\/>Grappling with these socio-economic dimensions is of fundamental importance for achieving a secure future information infrastructure, and developing a sound understanding of them requires research grounded in empiricism. Accordingly, the project has four key components: (1) pursue in-depth empirical analyses of a range of online criminal activities; (2) map out the evolving attacker ecosystem that preys on online social networks, and the extent to which unsafe online behavior is itself adopted and transmitted; (3) study how relationships among these criminals are established, maintained, and evolve over time; and (4) measure the efficacy of today's security interventions, both in the large and at the level of individual users. Across all of these efforts, the aim is to identify bottleneck elements where interventions might most effectively undermine entire ecosystems of abusive and criminal activities. Consequently, this research has the potential to dramatically benefit society by undermining entire cybercrime ecosystems: disrupting underground activities, infrastructure, and social networks through strategic intervention. The work will also create numerous educational opportunities, including undergraduate and graduate education as well as workforce education for security professionals, law enforcement, civil regulatory agencies, and legal scholars and professionals tasked with countering modern Internet threats.","title":"TWC: Frontier: Collaborative: Beyond Technical Security: Developing an Empirical Basis for Socio-Economic Perspectives","awardID":"1237264","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2017-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"8060","name":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace"}}],"PIcoPI":[525660,525661,525662,"530355",525664],"PO":["565239"]},"189604":{"abstract":"Development in humans and other higher organisms creates complex,<br\/>precisely defined multicellular structures and patterns.

Flexible materials are ubiquitous in manufacturung and surgery, and human examples demonstrate that complex manipulation of flexible materials is possible, from knot-tying to folding laundry or even origami. Robots are currently far less capable in these domains, leaving many boring, repetitive factory tasks inaccessible to robotic automation. Current simulation models of flexible objects are too computationally complex for standard approaches to manipulation planning to be effective. Furthermore, although the simulated dynamic behavior of a piece of string using existing models might be visually believable, the behavior is unlikely to match any particular piece of string in the real world and, therefore, is of limited use.<br\/><br\/>Knot tying has many applications ranging from manufacturing to surgery to agriculture and service robots. Manipulation of deformable objects is fundamental to many manufacturing and household applications. The proposed work has application to factory operations and seems to apply to potential future needs in manipulation of linear, flexible 1-D structures such as carbon nanotubes and proteins.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The development of reliable, inexpensive techniques for manipulation of flexible materials goes beyond the obvious potential impact on factory automation. Minimalism is particularly appropriate for problems involving manipulation at new scales. Fixtures for tying knots might be built at the microscale, allowing parallel manipulation of many very tiny threads or rods. Although we emphasize that the focus of the current work is on theoretical foundations and manipulation at the macro-scale, one can imagine using cleverly-designed geometries to manipulate carbon nano-tubes or proteins - things not possible with standard serial arm designs.","title":"RI: Small: Practical techniques for robotic manipulation of string and wire","awardID":"1217447","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":[517794],"PO":["564069"]},"193421":{"abstract":"Emerging technologies have led to revolutionary computing platforms<br\/>such as computing clouds and many genres of computing grids.

Future stereoscopic cameras may be made up of multiple (more than two) lenses to provide a denser sampling of viewpoints to ameliorate the mismatch between capture and viewing scenario dependent display, a problem that will grow as stereoscopic devices and displays become more ubiquitous. With an appropriate streaming system, a much richer user experience can be delivered that is both network adaptive and reduces the negative side-effects of stereoscopic imaging such as 3D eye fatigue. A multi-lens stereoscopic video framework will require the confluence of three interrelated components: compression and representation; retrieval, streaming and adaptation; and viewing scenario dependent optimization. These three components will act together to provide a low-latency, viewing scenario optimized experience for stereoscopic imaging. <br\/><br\/>With this architecture in mind, this project will:<br\/>* Investigate multi-lens compression technologies to support efficient retrieval and viewing scenario optimization. The compression of the multi-lens stereoscopic data needs to achieve high compression, but at the same time, be amenable to adaptation and subset retrieval. <br\/>* Develop adaptive streaming techniques for the proposed retrieval-friendly compression format. The key objective is to avoid introducing artifacts (due to the decreased quality) that make their way into the stereoscopic field. This adaptation layer will be coordinated with a viewing scenario dependent optimization in order to retrieve the best data possible while also being network adaptive.<br\/>* Develop viewing scenario dependent optimal display management technologies. To maximize viewing experience and minimize negative side effects, viewing scenario dependent optimization will select a subset of images from the array to best match the viewing scenario.

Despite the surge in crowdsourcing platforms, it remains very difficult and error-prone to employ crowdsourcing within an application: existing services mostly expose a procedural interface to post individual human-computation tasks, and provide little support (if any) for task coordination, reward management, or clean-up of the obtained answers. As a result, a large fraction of the application logistics is devoted to orchestrating and optimizing the interaction with the crowdsourcing service. This project explores the novel paradigm of declarative crowdsourcing through the development of the Deco database system. Deco models and offers support for accessing the collective knowledge of the crowd by posing declarative queries over a relational-like database. The project explores methods to mitigate the effect of \"noisy\" human workers who provide data of low quality and to model the resulting uncertainty in the answers returned by Deco. The two problems are tightly coupled with a tradeoff among the latency to contact human workers, the expense to recruit them and the quality of the data they provide. Handling this tradeoff in the context of query optimization is one of the key technical challenges addressed by the project. <br\/><br\/>The project represents a high-risk research effort, as it targets non-trivial problems that are inherent in the usage of crowdsourcing in practice.

The project tests a hypothesis that playing a number-sense action game can help children learn beyond the game, making them better overall at number-line sense, precision of numerosity, speed of numerical judgments, and ability to multitask numerical tasks. The innovation is twofold: a game, adapted from first-person shooter games, to train number sense, and a platform that makes it easy to vary aspects of the game (e.g., repetition, speed, number of possibilities) to be able to analyze what is it that is making a difference with respect to learning. Research is identifying the qualities of computer games that will train the brain to be automatic in its judgments and at qualities of experiences that promote such automaticity.<br\/><br\/>This project aims to promote fundamental mathematical competence in a way that makes the mathematics learning feel effortless and genuinely fun. In particular, the aim is to help children develop number sense, an ability to very quickly make estimates and numerical judgments. Such capability is key to keeping up in mathematics; children without that sense tend to lose interest in mathematics because mathematical computation becomes too frustrating. Training number sense, and, in turn, fostering mathematical performance, should allow more learners to think of themselves as \"good at math.\" Cultivating a child's interest in mathematics from a young age has been identified as key to feeding STEM career paths.<br\/><br\/>The vehicle for promoting such mathematics learning is a new type of video game with foundations in first-person shooter games. Rather than shooting, players cast spells that require quick numerical estimates. There is reason to believe that such a game will be as engaging as first-person shooter games are. First-person shooter games have been shown to increase attention and executive control in adults, the kinds of cognitive skills known to foster academic achievement. Because engaging video games will reach and be played by a wide range of children; such a game has potential to reach at-risk populations who most need to better develop their number sense and those important skills. The intent is for the game to be used in informal settings, providing a complementary tool for educators to foster mathematics skills. Research that is done in the context of this game will identify the characteristics of game play that promote skill automation, foundational knowledge that is needed to provide a road map for creating child-friendly consumer video games to improve other important aspects of core cognition beyond number sense.","title":"DIP: 'Hard Fun' Learning Mathematics: Stimulating Number Sense","awardID":"1227168","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2016-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8020","name":"Cyberlearning: Transforming Ed"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1109","name":"Division of RESEARCH ON LEARNING","abbr":"DRL"},"pgm":{"id":"7625","name":"REESE"}}],"PIcoPI":["533488",520759,"538216",520761,520762],"PO":["562669"]},"196501":{"abstract":"Autonomous navigation in unknown and dynamic environments has been a major challenge for synthetic mobile robotic agents.

An Institute of Medicine report has estimated that nearly 100,000 people per year die in US hospitals from preventable errors, and subsequent reports have suggested that many of these errors arise due to the complexity of hospital processes. The project will demonstrate how contextual information (retrospective, current, and prospective) can be used to provide process performers with timely information that could reduce errors, provide expedited warnings of impending hazards, and improve outcomes. Techniques to accumulate and represent historical data will be developed and will feed into profile-based analysis techniques that will evaluate probabilities and support making fine-grained process distinctions. These capabilities will provide a strong technological foundation for evidence-based, continuous process improvement.<br\/><br\/>Project technologies will be evaluated first using synthetic event streams generated by process model driven simulations, then by human simulations with nursing students using patient mannequins, and finally with medical professionals in simulated clinical settings. Processes to be examined include blood transfusion, chemotherapy, medication administration, and patient identification verification. Early community success in applying medical checklists and recent experimental results with proactive process guidance in a hospital emergency department are positive indications that the approaches proposed here have an excellent chance of gaining acceptance and improving medical outcomes. Moreover, the technologies developed here, although evaluated specifically for health care, will also apply to human-intensive systems increasingly employed in a wide range of domains in society. The validated medical processes and the proposed prototype will be an effective framework for educating medical professionals in current best practices. This project will also educate computer science and engineering students about the challenges posed by the medical domain, encouraging a new generation of specialists in this emerging interdisciplinary field. Its societal appeal will also help engage bright, energetic minority and female students thereby helping broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM generally and in computer science and engineering particularly.","title":"SHB: Collaborative Research:Context-aware, dynamic, smart checklists: key cyber-infrastructure for systems delivering quality health care","awardID":"1239334","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8018","name":"Smart Health & Wellbeing"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0706","name":"Division of DESIGN & MANUFACTURING INNOV","abbr":"DMI"},"pgm":{"id":"1787","name":"SERVICE ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["536735","536736","536737"],"PO":["565136"]},"193399":{"abstract":"The emergence of cloud computing brings a paradigm shift to the way that data is stored, accessed and utilized. Especially, outsourcing data to the public cloud enjoys unlimited resources with great economic savings for both data owners and users. However, user privacy concerns have been a major hurdle for the widespread adoption of the public cloud technology. Encryption techniques can protect the confidentiality of users' data, however, supporting effective data utilization such as search operations over encrypted data become a key challenge. Existing techniques are either too computationally expensive, or lack enough flexibility to be adopted by cloud users in practice. <br\/>This project aims at protecting user privacy in the cloud. It develops the tools to provide privacy-assured, usable, and efficient data utilization services in outsourced cloud storage systems. Specifically, it tackles the above challenges by combining cryptography with information-retrieval techniques, and focuses on three aspects: (1) the design of novel keyword search schemes over encrypted data with rich functionalities, including ranked search and multi-keyword search; (2) the design of privacy-preserving search schemes over data that are represented using various structures, such as graphs; (3) new approaches for protecting user privacy in the mobile cloud setting. This research also includes a prototyping and experimentation plan. <br\/>Ensuring user privacy is fundamental to the success of public cloud deployment.

In this EAGER project, they are carrying out a set of first steps in coming to understand how public spaces might be augmented with technology to promote and develop community interest and practice in civic engagement. The venue for the work is the Los Angeles State Historic Park, a 32-acre site in downtown LA that attracts families from several nearby ethnically-diverse neighborhoods. They are creating a prototype interpretive module for the park, an interactive mural that will act as an invitation to civic engagement and evolving social memory for the park and its surrounding communities. Evaluation centers on measuring and characterizing the engagement of park visitors, their participation with the media, and the interactions between media authorship, organizational structure, and youth civic engagement. Research is around issues in designing installations in ways that increase civic engagement, learning how and under what circumstances new types of embodied interaction technologies increase civic engagement, especially by neighborhood youth. Foundations for the design of the installation and experiences around it come from three theoretical perspectives: communities of practice, play and performativity, and the idea of an evolving social memory and the knowledge-building discourse that promotes such evolving memory. The challenge is to achieve the civic engagement and learning goals in the context of a space people visit primarily for recreation and play.<br\/><br\/>The potential broader impacts of this work lie in the possibilities of learning better how to use neighborhood and other public spaces to promote civic engagement and learning, especially among youth who frequent those places. Participation in activities in public spaces could complement formal education and be designed to support voluntary, self-directed learning, with particular potential for promoting positive affective responses and attitudes towards subject matter and ways of doing things. As a first step, this team is designing an interactive mural that community members will engage with as authors and collaborators. The goals here, as they iteratively revise the mural so that it encourages youth engagement with others in civic issues, is to move towards developing guidelines for designing other installations that could also promote such engagement. This project represents work in its early states on an untested but potentially transformative idea and is likely to catalyze rapid and innovative advances in the use of public spaces for promoting learning and civic engagement goals.","title":"EAGER: Cyberlearning at the Los Angeles State Historic Park","awardID":"1256227","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2014-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8020","name":"Cyberlearning: Transforming Ed"}}],"PIcoPI":["552478","552479","552477"],"PO":["562669"]},"196216":{"abstract":"The primary goal of this project is to develop a curricular design and educational resources to enable graduate students in the natural sciences to develop the fundamental skills needed to navigate difficult ethical issues found at the intersection of public policy and environmental science. Towards this goal, this project is developing four tools: (1) a model for effective practical deliberation; (2) reading guides and screen casts for texts in environmental ethics; (3) a curricular design that gives students an opportunity to build skills in deliberation and communication in public venues; and (4) and short-case study and documentary videos. The crux of this deliberative model approach is to focus on the practical dilemmas that arise. This approach enables students to isolate and clarify the various sources of conflict about environmental issues. Students will learn to identify three sources of conflict: those that stem from disagreements over moral principles and ideals; those that stem from differences in political commitments, economic interests and legal interpretation; and those that stem from differences in scientific understanding of environmental issues including different assessments of risk and uncertainty. The educational resources are designed to help students draw more effectively on the literature in environmental ethics, including some of the seminal classic texts by Leopold, Muir, and Thoreau, as well as more contemporary texts in applied ethics as they sort through environmental debates of social concern. With a richer understanding of the ethical issues, and an ability to communicate effectively in a public setting, we believe that students will be in a better position to work through and understand the underlying disagreements in a more thoughtful and intelligent manner. In order to practice what they have learned, the curricular design provides students with opportunities to participate in and lead discussions about climate change and other environmental issues of regional importance in a range of public settings including native communities within the region. Implementing these opportunities will also strengthen students' deliberative and communicative skills as they engage in dialogues with a broad cross-section of the public. <br\/>The impact of this work is expected to be very broad. The development and implementation of the community engagement activities build off existing outreach connections between NAU and the surrounding community and will engage Native American communities in the proposed discourse activities. Educational resources will be shared with the broader community, including the Museum of Northern Arizona, who will work with the project team to integrate these resources into the activities and displays of the museum. All of the educational resources and scaled versions of the curricular materials will be made publicly available through a variety of online channels, including YouTube.","title":"Collaborative Research: Deliberation and Communication--Building Practical Skills in the Next Generation of Environmental Scientists","awardID":"1237865","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0405","name":"Division of OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE","abbr":"SES"},"pgm":{"id":"1157","name":"MINORITY POSTDOC RSRCH FLW-NEW"}},{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0405","name":"Division of OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE","abbr":"SES"},"pgm":{"id":"1335","name":"IGERT FULL PROPOSALS"}},{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0405","name":"Division of OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE","abbr":"SES"},"pgm":{"id":"1397","name":"CROSS-DIRECTORATE  ACTIV PROGR"}},{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0405","name":"Division of OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE","abbr":"SES"},"pgm":{"id":"7491","name":"ETHICS EDU FOR SCI & ENG PROG"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"06","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES             ","abbr":"GEO"},"div":{"id":"0600","name":"Division of A\/D FUND","abbr":"A\/D"},"pgm":{"id":"1697","name":"OPPORT FOR ENHANCING DIVERSITY"}},{"dir":{"id":"06","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES             ","abbr":"GEO"},"div":{"id":"0600","name":"Division of A\/D FUND","abbr":"A\/D"},"pgm":{"id":"1733","name":"GEOSCIENCE EDUCATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0705","name":"Division of ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND CENT","abbr":"EEC"},"pgm":{"id":"1340","name":"ENGINEERING EDUCATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1106","name":"Division of HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT","abbr":"HRD"},"pgm":{"id":"1744","name":"TRIBAL COLLEGE & UNIVERS PROGR"}}],"PIcoPI":[526002,"537998",526004],"PO":["564439"]},"197558":{"abstract":"Scientists are increasingly limited by their ability to analyze the large amounts of complex data available. These data sets are generated not only by instruments but also computational experiments; the sizes of the largest numerical simulations are on par with data collected by instruments, crossing the petabyte threshold this year. The importance of large synthetic data sets is increasingly important, as scientists compare their experiments to reference simulations. All disciplines need a new ?instrument for data? that can deal not only with large data sets but the cross product of large and diverse data sets. <br\/><br\/>While the largest data sets have captured most of the public attention, they only represent the tip of the iceberg. What is often missed is that scientific data sets have a power law distribution. At one end are the very large data collections compiled by hundreds of scientists collaborating over multiple years. These projects typically have coherent data management plans and organization to ensure that the data products are accessible to a wide community. Nevertheless, the long-term curation of the data is still an unsolved problem. <br\/><br\/>At the other end of the distribution, in the \"long tail\", are the very large numbers of small data sets, such as the images, spreadsheets and tables collected in laboratories and field studies. While the individual files are small, their numbers add up; in fact, there is as much data aggregated in these small items as in the biggest collections. On the other hand, these data sets are often not as well documented as their bigger counterparts. For most scientists there is little reward in becoming a data management expert and devoting the time required to documenting the data for later reuse. In fact, the process of manually cleaning data sets has been called the strip mining of big data: an ugly and resource intensive effort that leaves big scars.<br\/><br\/>Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University have built innovative frameworks to publish scientific data across a wide range of disciplines, from astronomy to turbulence, and environmental science. These projects already share some common components for data management. This project will connect more of the existing independent components into a coherent one, explore how to scale the data services to deal with the \"long tail\" of the data distribution, and demonstrate the overlap in the basic data management tasks across disciplines. The project has four parts: (i) continue and enhance the efforts on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, (ii) turn large numerical simulations into easy-to-use numerical laboratories, (iii) enhance an existing end-to-end system for environmental sensors and integrate it with other field data, (iv) enhance and generalize a set of core collaborative tools, and apply these to help with the challenge of the \"long tail\" of scientific data.<br\/><br\/>The projects involve the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) -- the world's most used astronomy facility -- and its CASJOBs\/MyDB collaborative environment The framework will be extended to other areas of science, like in-situ environmental monitoring and field biology. This will be demonstrated by integrating data in soil ecology from the Baltimore Ecosystem Study project with data collected automatically, via a wireless sensor network. The project will also test, how a simple, \"DropBox\"-like interface (i.e., online storage and sharing) can be used to overcome some of the barriers that prevent scientists from publishing much of their value-added data. Finally, the project will explore how smaller and larger numerical simulations can be placed into interactive, publicly accessible numerical laboratories, using data sets currently from turbulence and astronomy. <br\/><br\/>The funds will support people: a combination of data scientists, database administrators, postdoctoral fellows, students and programmers working together to \"connect the dots\" and bring additional data sets on line. The project will enhance the public interfaces of several publicly available data sets, prototype an easy-to-use environment to upload small user data into a collaborative environment, and create a framework for a new citizen-science project in environmental science.","title":"Interdisciplinary Scientific Data Management","awardID":"1244820","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2014-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0404","name":"Division of BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE SCI","abbr":"BCS"},"pgm":{"id":"7701","name":"DATA INTEROPERABILITY NETWORKS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7726","name":"DATANET"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0801","name":"Division of ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY","abbr":"DEB"},"pgm":{"id":"7298","name":"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["551737",530044,530045,"538211","538212"],"PO":["565292"]},"196106":{"abstract":"This project tackles the social and economic elements of Internet security: how the motivations and interactions of attackers, defenders, and users shape the threats we face, how they evolve over time, and how they can best be addressed. While security is a phenomenon mediated by the technical workings of computers and networks, it is ultimately a conflict driven by economic and social issues that merit a commensurate level of scrutiny. Today's online attackers are commonly profit-seeking, and the implicit social networks that link them together play a critical role in fostering the innovation and the efficiency underlying cybercrime markets. Further, the socio-economic lens can provide vital insights not only for understanding attackers, but victims too. Today's consumers, corporations, and governments make large investments in security technology with little understanding of their ultimate return-on-investment. And the ease with which we adopt online personas and relationships has created a collective blind spot that attackers exploit all-too-easily.<br\/><br\/>Grappling with these socio-economic dimensions is of fundamental importance for achieving a secure future information infrastructure, and developing a sound understanding of them requires research grounded in empiricism. Accordingly, the project has four key components: (1) pursue in-depth empirical analyses of a range of online criminal activities; (2) map out the evolving attacker ecosystem that preys on online social networks, and the extent to which unsafe online behavior is itself adopted and transmitted; (3) study how relationships among these criminals are established, maintained, and evolve over time; and (4) measure the efficacy of today's security interventions, both in the large and at the level of individual users. Across all of these efforts, the aim is to identify bottleneck elements where interventions might most effectively undermine entire ecosystems of abusive and criminal activities. Consequently, this research has the potential to dramatically benefit society by undermining entire cybercrime ecosystems: disrupting underground activities, infrastructure, and social networks through strategic intervention. The work will also create numerous educational opportunities, including undergraduate and graduate education as well as workforce education for security professionals, law enforcement, civil regulatory agencies, and legal scholars and professionals tasked with countering modern Internet threats.","title":"TWC: Frontier: Collaborative: Beyond Technical Security: Developing an Empirical Basis for Socio-Economic Perspectives","awardID":"1237265","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2017-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"8060","name":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace"}}],"PIcoPI":["562327","563433",525668,"534318",525670],"PO":["565239"]},"199626":{"abstract":"Pairing is a fundamental problem of establishing secure, i.e., authenticated and confidential, connection between two previously unassociated devices over a short-range wireless radio channel.

To address this issue we propose to use a novel computational modeling approach, voxel-wise modeling. Voxel-wise modeling draws from the principles of nonlinear system identification, and it provides an efficient method for using complex data sets collected under naturalistic conditions to test multiple hypotheses about language representation. The specific research plan is divided into three aims, each targeted at a different form of language-related information. Aim 1 will reveal how low-level features of speech, such as spectral power, spectral modulation and phonemic structure, are represented across human cortex. Subjects will passively listen to human speech while hemodynamic brain activity is recorded by functional MRI. Voxel-wise modeling will then be used to determine how each point in the brain (i.e., each voxel, or volumetric pixel) is tuned for these various features. Using analogous methods, Aim 2 will reveal how syntactic and semantic features are represented across cortex. Finally, Aim 3 will reveal how language-related information is represented when it is delivered by auditory versus visual modalities. In this case speech and video stimuli will be used. Separate models will be estimated for data recorded during auditory and visual stimulation, and voxel-wise tuning will be compared across modalities. The voxel-wise computational models developed under this proposal will reveal how these various types of language-related information are represented across the cortical surface. These models will also provide clear predictions about how the brain will respond to novel speech stimuli. The results of the proposed research will have broad impacts on clinical problems related to speech perception and production, and they could form the basis of powerful brain decoding device that would enable neurological patients to communicate by thought alone.","title":"CRCNS: Cortical representation of phonetic, syntactic and semantic information during speech perception and language comprehension","awardID":"1208203","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2017-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7327","name":"CRCNS"}}],"PIcoPI":["546744","557870",513166],"PO":["564318"]},"192432":{"abstract":"The goal of this collaborative project (1212806, Ross T.

One focus is on making the movements of an avatar more lifelike; a second focus is on understanding how to effectively integrate gestures indicating friendliness with gestures used for promoting concept learning. Design of avatar gestures draws on the literature on the roles of gesturing in communication, the literature on grounded and embodied cognition, and the literature on mathematics. The focus of this Cyberlearning: Transforming Education Exploration proposal is on designing avatar gestures for promoting learning of mathematical equivalence. Analysis of the effects of those gestures and extraction of preliminary guidelines for gesture design will lay the groundwork for extending gesturing capabilities of avatars across disciplinary content areas. Research focuses on how to automatically animate an avatar with life-like qualities and the conditions under which adding gestures to a teaching avatar promotes engagement and learning.<br\/><br\/>Avatars are used extensively in learning technologies to guide learners' actions and to provide advice. But learners can be put off by avatars that are emotionless, and avatars technology does not yet combine gesturing and \"talking\" in the way good tutors and teachers do as they are trying to help learners learn difficult concepts. This project addresses both of those issues -- giving avatars enough personality so that learners will engage with them more readily and willingly and giving avatars the capability of gesturing in ways that are congruent with the concepts they are expressing. There are a variety of challenges in addressing these issues, some technical, some social, and some cognitive. The project team is addressing all three types of issues, working towards design principles for avatars that move and engage more naturally and that can gesture as people do when explaining difficult content. Enhancing the interactions between computers and people in ways that promote both sustained engagement and learning will improve the effectiveness of intelligent tutoring systems and other learning technologies across disciplines and across the ages of learners.","title":"EXP: Collaborative Research: A System of Animation Gestures for Effective Teaching Avatars","awardID":"1217137","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2014-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8020","name":"Cyberlearning: Transforming Ed"}}],"PIcoPI":[517602],"PO":["562669"]},"196502":{"abstract":"This project explores balancing performance considerations and power consumption in cyber-physical systems, through algorithms that switch among different modes of operation (e.g., low-power\/high-power, on\/off, or mobile\/static) in response to environmental conditions.

These problems generally require dexterity, complex perception, and complex physical interaction. Yet, many such problems can be reliably addressed with human\/robot collaborative (HRC) systems, where one or more humans provide needed perception and adaptability, working with one or more robot systems that provide speed, precision, accuracy, and dexterity at an appropriate scale, combining these complementary capabilities.<br\/><br\/>The project focuses on multilateral manipulation, which arises when a human controls one or more robot manipulators in partnership with one or more additional controllers (humans or autonomous agents). Complex operations in surgery and manufacturing can benefit from the extra degrees of freedom provided by more than two hands, and training often depends on hands-on interaction between expert and apprentice. Example applications include surgical operations, which typically involve several physicians and assistants, and other medical tasks such as turning a patient in bed and wrapping a cast to constrain a hand. Multilateral manipulation also applies in manufacturing, for example for threading wires or cables, aligning gaskets to obtain a tight seal, and in many household situations, such as folding tablecloths, wrapping packages, and zipping overfilled suitcases so they will fit inside diabolically-designed overhead airline compartments. Multilateral manipulation often arises with deformable materials or multi-jointed objects with more than six degrees of freedom (DOF). The extra DOFs in materials introduce challenges such as computational complexity, but they also can accommodate minor inconsistencies through redundancy and provide system damping. This project advances the fundamental science of multilateral manipulation guided by specific applications from surgery and manufacturing.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Multilateral manipulation systems have the potential to improve healthcare, improve American competitiveness and product quality in manufacturing, and open the door to new service robot applications in the home.

The big research issue addressed is coming to understand both when and why remote labs promote effective learning and teaching. The project team is addressing this question in the context of using a high-school radiation lab for several different purposes. They are refining student and teacher materials over the course of the project so they can serve as models for other virtual lab experiences. The lab journal that is being refined is designed to include scaffolding for carrying out investigations in online remote labs that will be generally applicable across laboratory contexts. Research shows that access to remote labs helps students better grasp the reality of their investigative experience than do simulations when students do not have access to first-hand experience with physical phenomena; students experience phenomena as more real when carrying out experiments using remote labs than when using simulations to carry out the same experiments. This suggests that for schools without lab equipment and for situations where investigations are too dangerous or sophisticated to be carried out in a classroom, online remote labs can play a powerful role in promoting both content learning and science literacy.<br\/><br\/>If we truly want our full population to be scientifically literate, then giving every teen the opportunity to participate in meaningful laboratory experiences that allow them to experience what scientists do and how scientists reason is essential.

Some such labs have sophisticated equipment that would be inappropriate in a school; some have simpler equipment that many schools simply cannot afford. Remote labs are accessed by individuals or student teams using a user interface that is developmentally appropriate for the learners and that allows them to run and refine and rerun experiments and watch from afar as real equipment carries out their instructions. Making remote labs work well in classrooms requires having the kinds of tools for teachers that will allow teachers to facilitate investigation activities and monitor the progress of individuals and groups in the class as they do their investigations online and remotely. This project's focus is on one particular remote online lab (a Geiger counter), creating meaningful experiences for high schoolers around that lab, and identifying the kinds of tools teachers need to facilitate such experiences effectively.

This hierarchical structure is critical to humans' unique ability to tackle complex, large-scale tasks, since it allows such tasks to be decomposed or broken down into more manageable parts. While some progress has been made toward understanding the origins and mechanisms of hierarchical behavior, key questions remain: How are task-subtask-action hierarchies initially assembled through learning? How does learning operate within such hierarchies, allowing adaptive hierarchical behavior to take shape? How do the relevant learning and action-selection processes play out in neural hardware? <br\/><br\/>To pursue these questions, the present proposal will leverage ideas emerging from the computational framework of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). HRL builds on a highly successful machine-learning paradigm known as reinforcement learning (RL), extending it to include task-subtask-action hierarchies. Recent neuroscience and behavioral research has suggested that standard RL mechanisms may be directly relevant to reward-based learning in humans and animals. The present proposal hypothesizes that the mechanisms introduced in computational HRL may be similarly relevant, providing insight into the cognitive and neural underpinnings of hierarchical behavior. <br\/><br\/>The project brings together two computational cognitive neuroscientists and a computer scientist with expertise in machine learning. The proposed research, which includes both computational modeling and human functional neuroimaging and behavioral studies, pursues a set of hypotheses drawn directly from HRL research. A first set of hypotheses relates to the question of how complex tasks are decomposed into manageable subtasks. Here, fMRI and computational work will leverage the idea, drawn from HRL research, that useful decompositions \"carve\" tasks at points identifiable through graph-theoretic measures of centrality. A second set of hypotheses relates to the question of how learning occurs within hierarchies. Here, fMRI and modeling work will pursue the idea that hierarchical learning may be driven by reward prediction errors akin to those arising within the HRL framework. The project as a whole aims to construct a biologically constrained neural network model, translating computational HRL into an account of how the brain supports hierarchically structured behavior.","title":"CRCNS: Collaborative Research: Neural Correlates of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning","awardID":"1208051","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7327","name":"CRCNS"}}],"PIcoPI":["513288"],"PO":["564318"]},"192444":{"abstract":"This project is creating a novel paradigm for computer vision, termed \"reconstructive recognition\", that incorporates the strongest elements of previous machine learning-based recognition efforts and the strongest elements of previous reconstruction efforts based on radiometric reasoning.

By improving the efficiency of spatial, temporal, and moving object data management and making these results available to constituencies via TerraFly, EarthCube and other venues, the project will produce societal benefits. This project provides a foundation for improving the quality of services in multiple applications such as disaster management, environmental monitoring, transportation, education, and logistics. The resulting technologies may serve as a base to advance research on self-navigating vehicles, robots, and mobile sensors. In particular, this work facilitates the technologies of Informed Traveler Programs, dynamic navigation, situation control, and airborne observational systems. The project provides rich educational and research opportunities for students from the collaborating institutions -- including underrepresented students. In addition, educational modules are developed, and research results will be incorporated in curriculum expansions.

Energy is an important system resource for mobile and embedded systems that are battery-powered and thermally constrained. Per-process energy accounting is important for software evaluation and optimization as well as system energy management and security. <br\/><br\/>This project tackles this hard problem with two novel methodologies. First, it leverages the smart battery interface available in modern mobile systems and statistical learning to estimate system energy consumption for very short time intervals. Second, the project exploits and extends technologies from multi-player game theory, in particular, Shapley value, to distribute the system energy consumption to concurrently running processes. The project targets three novel contributions: (1) system and algorithmic solutions to achieve high accuracy in system energy estimation for very short time intervals without any external assistance; (2) extended multi-player game theory based on Shapley value to distribute system energy consumption to running processes with incomplete measurement; and (3) utility-based system energy management based on per-process energy accounting. Results from this project apply to not only mobile systems but also servers and data centers. By applying statistical learning and game theory to systems research, the project produces novel, interdisciplinary curriculum modules for teaching both these theories and operating systems. The project also generates open-source tools and data sets for energy modeling and optimization in mobile systems.","title":"CSR: Small: Collaborative Research: Per-Process Energy Accounting in Mobile Systems","awardID":"1218041","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["548312"],"PO":["565255"]},"193676":{"abstract":"Today's multicore processors are often underutilized because programmers lack tools and techniques to program them effectively. To understand the problem, imagine that a microprocessor is like a restaurant kitchen. For years, processor designers improved execution speed, replacing the chef with one who can work even faster. Because this strategy has physical limits, hardware vendors are turning to multicore CPUs, akin to multiple chefs. Some problems adapt easily to multiple cores; if you need to bake 16 identical cakes, it's easy to use 16 chefs in separate kitchens (i.e., symmetric parallelism). But if you need to prepare a complex banquet (i.e., irregular parallelism), the many tasks can require significant coordination. One mistake (e.g., two chefs using the same bowl at the same time) and the results may be disastrously wrong. Experience has shown that few programmers can foresee and avoid all possible coordination issues ahead of time. This project develops the approach Observationally Cooperative Multithreading (OCM) for solving problems on parallel machines. OCM makes it easier to write correct code, while allowing speedup on from multiple processing cores. Because of its simplicity, OCM could make parallelism and concurrency more accessible to a broad audience, including introductory students.<br\/><br\/>Specifically, in programs written for the well-understood cooperative multithreading (CM) model, subtasks take turns and execute one at a time. This approach rules out conflicts between subtasks and simplifies programming and debugging. OCM takes these same programs but runs them on modern multicore machines, executing subtasks simultaneously (and hence more efficiently) when there are no conflicts. This research, extending preliminary work on OCM, will involve 18 undergraduate students over three years. They will help design, develop and evaluate practical OCM implementations using techniques such as Transactional Memory and Lock Inference, addressing the concerns both of the parallel-programming community (who value demonstrated performance) and of the CS education community (who value ease of use and desperately need a simpler introduction to concurrency and parallelism).","title":"SHF:Small:RUI: Observationally Cooperative Multithreading","awardID":"1219243","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2878","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CCF"}}],"PIcoPI":[518669,"533642"],"PO":["564588"]},"197801":{"abstract":"The pace of scientific discovery has been rapid in recent years owing to cyberinfrastructures that enable researchers to: (a) remotely access distributed computing resources and big data sets, and (b) effectively collaborate with remote peers, at a global-scale.

The research focuses on how to constrain a virtual lab experience to be amenable to automated feedback on relatively open-ended responses students are generating while still giving students an appropriate exploratory experience. The technology innovation question is how to do that with validity and reliability. The team is focusing on how to use available artificial intelligence technologies to make it possible to provide good feedback, both to learners working in these environments and to their teachers. PIs are adding dynamic formative assessment capabilities to virtual lab experiences that are already extensively used in undergraduate and high-school biology classes.<br\/><br\/>This is an automated assessment project, focusing on assessing learner understanding and capabilities in situations where learners are exploring, having, and using ideas as they are learning STEM content and practices. There are several ways one could approach automated assessment for situations where learners are acting in a fairly unconstrained way -- design algorithms that can interpret and make inferences from free text, or find ways to design the environment in such a way that learners can explore, develop, and record as needed for deep learning but where they have a more constrained way of expressing themselves or limitations in what they can do that don't constrain the learning or engagement. This project seeks to find a sweet spot -- a happy medium where learners can explore, try things out, have ideas, refine ideas, and use ideas with significant freedom but just enough constraint for already-existing artificial intelligence algorithms to interpret what learners are doing, why they are doing it, and what they mean to express. Learning how to do this is essential to designing the learning environments of the future.<br\/><br\/>There is broad acknowledgement that more attention must be given in STEM fields to the teaching of higher-order thinking skills, including experimental design, data interpretation and evidence-based judgment. Timely formative assessment is a crucial component of such learning, but formative assessment is impossible for a teacher to do for a whole class of individuals at the time when it will have the most effect (when students are engaging in or have just finished engaging in such activities) and too labor intensive to be done regularly in large high school and introductory-level college classes. This project is therefore developing techniques for automatically providing immediate formative assessment as students are conducting simulation-based experiments and reasoning about their results. The investigation focuses on helping students learn to conduct experiments and interpret results within the discipline of biology; lessons learned will be applicable across STEM domains at the high-school and college levels.","title":"DIP: Using dynamic formative assessment models to enhance learning of the experimental process in biology","awardID":"1227245","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2016-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8020","name":"Cyberlearning: Transforming Ed"}}],"PIcoPI":[520843,520844,520845,520846],"PO":["562669"]},"193368":{"abstract":"Graphene transistors are widely considered exciting candidates for analog, mixed-signal, and radio frequency systems in high-frequency applications.

The International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP) is a large and rapidly growing open library of public domain machine-printed classical music scores, actively used by many musicians, music scholars, and researchers around the world. The PI's objective in this exploratory project is to begin creating the algorithms needed for automatic optical music recognition (OMR) to convert scanned musical scores into symbolic representations. This is the first step in the PI's long-term goal of building a system to transform the library's score images into symbolic representations, bringing the IMSLP community together in a Wikipedia-like collaboration to mine this invaluable resource. The result will be a comprehensive and open music library of symbolic scores allowing unprecedented access while forming the basis of many new music applications as well as commercial potential.<br\/><br\/>While there have been many efforts at OMR over the last fifty years, the current state of the art is far below what the IMSLP challenge requires. Existing systems require such laborious error correction that it is not clear if they actually improve on manual data entry. OMR is much harder than its optical character recognition (OCR) counterpart due to the fundamentally two-dimensional layout of music, which makes it difficult to cast the problem in terms of familiar recognition paradigms. Thus the primary focus of the current work lies in creating and implementing an appropriate recognition paradigm suitable for the two-dimensional structure of music notation, building in knowledge of notation conventions and allowing for automatic adaptation. To this end, the PI will explore strategies that merge recognition with segmentation, express the desire for non-overlapping musical symbols in a principled way, and model the interpretation problem which understands the often ambiguous meaning of the recognized symbols.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: A large open music library of symbolic scores, as well as offering widespread and easy access to one of our culture's richest traditions, will be transformative for musicians, music researchers, and music lovers. Libraries will be able to distribute music scores electronically and globally, allowing for adaptive display, ongoing scholarly annotation, and registration of scores with video and audio. The prevalence of symbolic music scores will open up a world of possibilities to music-science researchers, including systems for music information retrieval, expressive performance, automatic musical accompaniment, transcription and arranging, performance assistance, and many others. Finally, the library will enable important commercial applications. For example, many expect that devices such as the iPad will form the sheet music \"delivery systems\" of the future; the benefits of basing such digital music readers on symbolically represented music are compelling, including automatic page turning and content-based annotation.","title":"EAGER: Large Scale Optical Music Recognition on the International Music Core Library Project","awardID":"1257141","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2014-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[535947,535948],"PO":["565227"]},"196547":{"abstract":"As computing devices continue to be embedded in more and more physical devices, they are now privy to the most confidential information about our lives.

They have the potential to process high speed network applications, such as deep packet inspection, and multi-channel real-time streaming of high-definition audio and video. However, they need better scheduling approaches to address the demand of high throughput and low latency of these applications while reducing energy consumption. Current approaches do not consider real-time demands, network traffic patterns and details of the specific multicore architectures. Lack of power-aware core scheduling and thermal management has also led to a great challenge in energy efficiency. Reducing power consumption saves energy cost, reduces the need for building additional cooling, and improves computer hardware reliability.<br\/><br\/>This project makes fundamental contributions to the design and applications of high-demand network systems. It provides packet level scheduling solutions that improve throughput, reduce latency and energy consumption. The project develops and incorporates network traffic models, architectural details, power consumption models, and thermal models simultaneously for coordinated workload processing and energy consumption. Quality-of-service (QoS) of packet streams\/connections is also considered by improving the jitter and out-of-order packet departures. Superiority of the proposed technical approaches is verified through real implementation of network applications and performance and power measurements on commercial multicore architectures. An open-source framework is developed for multicore scheduling, and is made available to the researchers along with optimized multithreaded codes for network applications.","title":"CSR: Small: Power-Efficient Multicore Scheduling for Network Applications","awardID":"1216014","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":[516924],"PO":["565255"]},"194964":{"abstract":"This project, acquiring a reconfigurable multi-user immersive visualization system (Mechdyne FLEX), aims to support a new style of collaborative and interdisciplinary design and experimentation in the fields of human health and wellbeing, human cognition, human behavior, computer science, gaming and game-based applications, product design, language and linguistics, and digital arts and new media.<br\/><br\/>FLEX provides opportunities to improve knowledge and perception of the world by enabling observation and manipulation of events and information that take place in remote spaces, are protracted or dilated in time, are hazardous, or are either too small or too large to view in intricate detail.

Message-locked encryption can encrypt with a key derived from the message itself, to enable secure de-duplication.

To ensure its reliable operation, a nation-wide or continent-wide situational awareness system is essential to provide high-resolution understanding of the system dynamics such that proper actions can be taken in real-time in response to power system disturbances and to avoid cascading blackouts. The power grid represents a typical highly dynamic cyber-physical system (CPS). The ever-increasing complexity and scale in sensing and actuation, compounded by the limited knowledge of the accurate system state have resulted in major system failures, such as the massive power blackout of August 2003 and the most recent Arizona\/California blackout of September 2011. Therefore, methods and tools for monitoring and control of these and other such dynamic systems at high resolution are vital to an emergent generation of tightly coupled, physically distributed CPS. This project employs the power grid as a target application and develops a high-resolution, ultra-wide-area situational awareness system that synergistically integrates sensing, processing, and actuation. First, from the sensing perspective, high resolution is reflected in both measurement accuracy and potential for dense spatial coverage. Wide area, precise, synchronized, and affordable sensing in voltage angle and frequency measurements for large-scale observation is sorely needed to observe system disturbances and capture critical changes in the power grid. The crucial innovation of this work is to make accurate frequency measurement from low voltage distribution systems through the wide deployment of Frequency Disturbance Recorders (FDRs). Second, from a data processing perspective, high resolution is reflected in finer-scale data analysis to reveal hidden information. In practical CPS, events seldom occur in an isolated fashion; cascading events are more common and realistic. A new conceptual framework is presented in the study of event analysis, referred to as event unmixing, where real-world events are considered a mixture of more than one constituent root event. This concept is a key enabler for the analysis of events to go beyond what are immediately detectable in the system. The event formation process is interpreted from a linear mixing perspective and innovative sparsity-constrained unmixing algorithms are presented for multiple event separation and spatial-temporal localization. Third, to discover the high-level spatial-temporal correlation among root events in real time, a descriptive language is developed to discover patterns on the spatial and temporal information of root events. This descriptive language allows embedding pattern descriptions on the desirable and undesirable interactions between events in the system, which will then be compiled into distributed runtime constructs to be executed in deployed systems. Fourth, from the actuation perspective, the system pushes the intelligence toward the lower level of the power grid allowing local devices to make decisions and to react quickly to contingencies based on the high-resolution understanding of the system state, enabling a more direct reconfiguration of the physical makeup of the grid. Finally, the methods and tools are implemented and validated on an existing wide-area power grid monitoring system, the North American frequency monitoring network (FNET).<br\/><br\/>Escalating demands for electricity coupled with an outdated power transmission grid pose a serious threat to the US economy. The transformative nature of this research is to turn a large volume of real-time data into actionable information and help prevent potential outages from happening. The power grid is a typical example of dynamic cyber physical system. Providing high-resolution situational awareness for the power grid has a direct and immediate impact on this and other CPS. The research is coupled with a strong educational component including active recruitment of students from underrepresented groups supported by existing programs and broad dissemination of research findings.","title":"CPS: Synergy: Achieving High-Resolution Situational Awareness in Ultra-Wide-Area Cyber-Physical Systems","awardID":"1239478","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7918","name":"CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS)"}}],"PIcoPI":[527043,527044,527045,527046],"PO":["565136"]},"196779":{"abstract":"Technology and economic trends in computer hardware have led to the widespread adoption of extremely large clusters of multicore servers as today?s supercomputers.

Although the bandwidth of the interconnect networks in current supercomputer systems is almost keeping up with increases in compute performance, there has been little improvement in the overhead of sending messages, and correspondingly little improvement in the throughput of the network when sending short messages.

This project is investigating the programming models required to use this network efficiently and is evaluating the performance of the new interconnect network in direct comparison with a modern (quad-data-rate Infiniband) interconnect that is widely used in current supercomputers.<br\/><br\/>The evaluation of the new system is being conducted through a number of case studies. Implementations of algorithms known to exhibit poor parallel scaling on standard systems due to network performance limitations are being ported to the new system and instrumented with timers and hardware performance counters to document the detailed performance characteristics. This study will provide an initial evaluation of the technical viability of the current implementation of this new architecture for these algorithms, and is expected to provide recommendations for future enhancements to the architecture.","title":"Design and Implementation of Algorithms for an Experimental High-Radix Network Switching system","awardID":"1240652","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2013-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"L121","name":"National Security Agency"}}],"PIcoPI":[527875],"PO":["565272"]},"193149":{"abstract":"One of the critical problems---if not the critical problem---in<br\/>reaching the exascale computing goal by the end of the decade is the<br\/>power problem.

That is, they will be able to express their understanding of how things work -- devices, systems, and phenomena -- in the language of systems and computing. The kinds of \"important ideas\" the PIs refer to include systems- and process-related ideas across STEM and other disciplines, including, for example, history and governance. The proposed new medium for expression is called \"Dynamic Simulation\", and in this EAGER project, the PIs are identifying what a dynamic simulation needs to include so that a new and better medium for representing, understanding, exploring, and communicating complex relationships can be developed. The idea is that this new medium will allow more complex relationships among functions and workings of systems to be expressed than can currently be done with easily accessible mathematical, visual, programming, and natural languages. It is expected that the new dynamic language for expression will be a qualitatively new and considerably better follow on to systems such as Etoys and Scratch. Those languages, though very successfully used to express important ideas of elementary-school and middle-school complexity, are too limited for expression of more sophisticated systems-related ideas. It is envisioned that the new language will allow expression of relationships in natural systems, social systems, technological systems, and the biological, psychological, and anthropological systems we are as individuals. Furthermore, the goal is that use of such expressive tools and the representations will allow learners and users to \"see\" the dynamic artifacts they are creating from a variety of different perspectives, allowing them to extract meaning and significance that otherwise might be too abstract to envision. Foundations for bringing the vision to fruition are in computing itself. As the proposal states, \"[s]ince computing is about processes, the science of computing is the science of processes. And within computing, as with many other fields since the 17th century, science and engineering are in a dynamic yin-yang of making and experimenting, observing, and creating models to further both arts.\" <br\/><br\/>As appropriate to the EAGER program, this is \"vision-directed\" research; it is focused on what might be and its activities are aimed toward \"problem finding\" so that a later concrete plan can be formulated. The results of problem finding will be concrete characterizations of many of the problems that will need to be solved to turn parts of the vision into reality. The claim is that we can help our youth better understand process- and systems-oriented phenomena by giving them better means of expressing their understanding. What is needed for that is an expressive computational language that will allow them to express relationships between parts of a system and the ways those parts interact with each other in a dynamic way. The expressive language, the focus of this early project, is a first step in achieving the bigger vision and is conceived as a concrete resource that will allow others to envision educational possibilities.","title":"EAGER: Anticipating The Future of STEM+SC Interactive Learning Environments","awardID":"1256774","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2014-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}}],"PIcoPI":[535733,535734],"PO":["562669"]},"190312":{"abstract":"The University of Colorado proposes to extend and scale the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) as a means to increase women?s meaningful participation in information technology careers.

This persistent neural activity is believed to be critical for processing new information and forming cognitive perceptions. Recent studies suggest that purely circuit-based mechanisms are insufficient to explain the robustness of persistent activity to biological noise and perturbation. This proposal will test the hypothesis that persistent activity is maintained by a hybrid cellular\/circuit mechanism in which circuit level feedback mediates the activation of memory processes in a neuron's dendrites known as plateau potentials. To quantitatively understand how active dendritic properties contribute to persistent activity, a new modeling framework will be developed to directly and simultaneously fit a memory network to data from a diverse set of experiments characterizing intrinsic excitability, anatomical connectivity, neural coding, and response to perturbations. These models will be used to predict the patterns of dendritic activity that can be seen with fluorescence calcium imaging. To test these predictions, the zebrafish preparation will be used to directly measure dendritic activity during eye movement behavior from cells storing a memory of desired eye position. Two-photon imaging of calcium indicators will be used to measure spatiotemporal patterns of activity in the dendritic neuropil, and separately in individual dendritic branchlets, to determine the presence of plateau potentials. Together, these computational and experimental results will help determine how cellular and circuit properties work in concert to generate one of the most important brain dynamics, persistent neural activity.","title":"CRCNS: Collaborative Research: The Role of Dendritic Processing in Persistent Neural Activity","awardID":"1208218","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7327","name":"CRCNS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0804","name":"Division of EMERGING FRONTIERS","abbr":"EF"},"pgm":{"id":"7275","name":"CROSS-EF ACTIVITIES"}}],"PIcoPI":[513172,513173],"PO":["564318"]},"196802":{"abstract":"ETR Associates will design and test a near-peer strategy, called CSteach, for infusing Computer Science (CS) content and the connection between CS and the social good into K-12 technology programming curriculum.

This small and fully contained instrument device combines ad-hoc networking capabilities of IEEE 802.11p and WAVE with centralized cellular communications. It contains navigation sensors, human-machine interface (HMI) components, and traditional communications ports such as RS-232, USB, and WiFi to communicate with tethered equipment. The device can function both as an on-board unit and as a road-side unit connected with infrastructure. The platform will include both the hardware components necessary to construct a realistic vehicular networking testbed and the software tools needed to quickly develop and deploy protocols and applications on the system.<br\/><br\/>Vehicular networks constitute an important emerging application of embedded wireless systems. With a large market (250 million registered vehicles in USA alone in 2006), vehicular networking technology has captured the attention of automotive manufacturers, academic researchers, and governmental agencies. Future vehicles will communicate with other vehicles on an ad-hoc basis with infrastructure access points using the recently ratified IEEE 802.11p, IEEE 1609.3, and IEEE 1609.4 (WAVE) standards. These vehicles will also have the ability to access the wide-area network using cellular systems such as UMTS, WiMAX, or LTE. Research efforts in vehicular networking protocols and systems require hardware platforms that support all vehicular communication paths for development and verification. Consequently, the development of this instrument is well justified.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: <br\/>This instrument will help to alleviate the traffic congestion that continues to worsen in cities of all sizes creating an annual drain that exceeds $112 billion in the USA economy alone in the form of 4.8B lost hours and 3.9 billion gallons of wasted fuel in 2009. It should further help to prevent traffic accident fatalities (37,262 in 2008, according to the statistics in the report of the Department of Transportation for that year). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that traffic accidents accounted for 1.2% of all deaths in USA in 2006. The instrumentation will also enable researchers to perform practical development and verification of vehicular networking technologies aimed at alleviating these problems and contributing to establish a higher standard in vehicular networks research. Moreover, the project offers promising commercialization potential for the dissemination of the resulting instrumentation.<br\/><br\/>On the educational side, the instrumentation will enhance student learning in Vehicular Networking, Mobile Computing, Transportation Modeling, Traffic Signal Systems, and Intelligent Transportation Systems at institutions studying advanced transportation systems. It will also be used in area middle and high school demonstrations to increase interest in STEM disciplines. The team projects and active learning are emphasized in 6 courses that are taught in summer (more are planned for development). The instrumentation will be integrated by offering hands-on projects. Results will be disseminated in technical and educational conferences and journals.","title":"MRI: Development of Instrumentation to Support Multi-Technology Vehicular Networking Systems Research","awardID":"1229616","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}}],"PIcoPI":[522461,522462,522463],"PO":["557609"]},"191435":{"abstract":"Memories on the time scale of seconds to tens of seconds are stored as patterns of neural activity that persist long after the offset of a stimulus. This persistent neural activity is believed to be critical for processing new information and forming cognitive perceptions. Recent studies suggest that purely circuit-based mechanisms are insufficient to explain the robustness of persistent activity to biological noise and perturbation. This proposal will test the hypothesis that persistent activity is maintained by a hybrid cellular\/circuit mechanism in which circuit level feedback mediates the activation of memory processes in a neuron's dendrites known as plateau potentials. To quantitatively understand how active dendritic properties contribute to persistent activity, a new modeling framework will be developed to directly and simultaneously fit a memory network to data from a diverse set of experiments characterizing intrinsic excitability, anatomical connectivity, neural coding, and response to perturbations. These models will be used to predict the patterns of dendritic activity that can be seen with fluorescence calcium imaging. To test these predictions, the zebrafish preparation will be used to directly measure dendritic activity during eye movement behavior from cells storing a memory of desired eye position. Two-photon imaging of calcium indicators will be used to measure spatiotemporal patterns of activity in the dendritic neuropil, and separately in individual dendritic branchlets, to determine the presence of plateau potentials. Together, these computational and experimental results will help determine how cellular and circuit properties work in concert to generate one of the most important brain dynamics, persistent neural activity.","title":"CRCNS: Collaborative Research: The Role of Dendritic Processing in Persistent Neural Activity","awardID":"1208088","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7327","name":"CRCNS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0804","name":"Division of EMERGING FRONTIERS","abbr":"EF"},"pgm":{"id":"7275","name":"CROSS-EF ACTIVITIES"}}],"PIcoPI":["513173"],"PO":["564318"]},"193536":{"abstract":"The human brain contains roughly 100 billion neurons.

Inspired by discoveries in neurobiology, hidden layers of deep learning systems encode hierarchically distributed representations of complex inputs. However, the fundamental mismatch between a highly parallel architecture and the serial structure of conventional processors limits the scalability of software-based DML systems.

These problems generally require dexterity, complex perception, and complex physical interaction. Yet, many such problems can be reliably addressed with human\/robot collaborative (HRC) systems, where one or more humans provide needed perception and adaptability, working with one or more robot systems that provide speed, precision, accuracy, and dexterity at an appropriate scale, combining these complementary capabilities.<br\/><br\/>The project focuses on multilateral manipulation, which arises when a human controls one or more robot manipulators in partnership with one or more additional controllers (humans or autonomous agents). Complex operations in surgery and manufacturing can benefit from the extra degrees of freedom provided by more than two hands, and training often depends on hands-on interaction between expert and apprentice. Example applications include surgical operations, which typically involve several physicians and assistants, and other medical tasks such as turning a patient in bed and wrapping a cast to constrain a hand. Multilateral manipulation also applies in manufacturing, for example for threading wires or cables, aligning gaskets to obtain a tight seal, and in many household situations, such as folding tablecloths, wrapping packages, and zipping overfilled suitcases so they will fit inside diabolically-designed overhead airline compartments. Multilateral manipulation often arises with deformable materials or multi-jointed objects with more than six degrees of freedom (DOF). The extra DOFs in materials introduce challenges such as computational complexity, but they also can accommodate minor inconsistencies through redundancy and provide system damping. This project advances the fundamental science of multilateral manipulation guided by specific applications from surgery and manufacturing.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Multilateral manipulation systems have the potential to improve healthcare, improve American competitiveness and product quality in manufacturing, and open the door to new service robot applications in the home.

To achieve the goal of personal robots in homes, the robots must adapt to the humans? living space, not vice-versa. Unfortunately, most human living spaces appear cluttered and unstructured to a robot. Much of this \"clutter\" is in fact structure, but structure for humans, not robots.

The demonstrator task is a canonical example of human-robot coexistence: sharing a refrigerator. The robot must be able to extract specified items from a refrigerator that may also be accessed and altered by humans. We will develop the beginnings of a solution based on the following principles: such manipulation tasks can be solved by a hierarchical two-level planning strategy, consisting of a high-level metaplanner making use of low-level primitives; the low-level primitives should include push-grasping, sweeping, and other nonprehensile actions that take advantage of mechanics to manipulate cluttered environments when simple grasp-and-carry is impeded; and uncertainty in the state of the environment and its physical properties should be accounted for at both the metaplanner and primitive levels.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Although not all outreach goals can be completed within the revised scope, cluttered tasks are critically important for an aging population of about 35 million people (one in eight) in the United States.

Several recent undergraduates working in the labs at CMU and Northwestern have gone on to PhD study in robotics, some with NSF graduate fellowships. Graduate students on this project will participate in internships at the Museum of Science and Industry during its upcoming Robot Revolution exhibit. They will interact with the public and help develop a robot manipulation demonstration for the exhibit main stage. These students will provide technical expertise to the exhibit while benefitting from a valuable outreach experience. Other planned outreach activities include lab tours and talks at local high schools. Both PIs serve as mentors in research programs for underrepresented undergraduate students. These students would have an opportunity to work on state-of-the-art manipulation hardware as part of this project.","title":"NRI-Small: Collaborative Research: Addressing Clutter and Uncertainty for Robotic Manipulation in Human Environments","awardID":"1208479","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2014-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["522422"],"PO":["564069"]},"194934":{"abstract":"This project, developing an instrument for near-real-time high-accuracy musculoskeletal system analysis named SKELETALMI, aims to enable timely and accurate measurement, analysis, and characterization of in vivo combined joint movement, whole body kinematics, skeletal muscle activity, and body reaction forces.

Programming such multicore processors is much more difficult than programming a single computer, so one of the major research challenges in Computer Science is to design and implement tools that make this programming task easier. The Autograph project focuses on one aspect of this problem, which is the implementation of data structures that can be read and written safely by multiple cores at the same time. When completed, the Autograph tool will permit multicore programmers to specify the properties of the desired data structure, leaving it to the tool to synthesize the parallel data structure automatically. This tool will simplify the parallel programming task substantially.<br\/><br\/>The input to Autograph is a high-level relational specification of the desired parallel data structure. Autograph works by composing a set of \"building-block\" data structures called tiles to implement the parallel data structure. The application programmer can control which tiles are used to produce the desired data structure. Therefore, application programmers can quickly produce parallel data structure implementations and tune their performance without having to write explicitly parallel code. Autograph will (i) implement the full system for the complete relational specification language, (ii) build code generators that can produce parallel C++ graph data structures from this language, (iii) extend this compiler to produce distributed-memory data structures, (iv) produce tools for autotuning the generated implementations, and (v) investigate the use of Autograph in implementing a GraphBLAS. Autograph will be implemented and demonstrated in the context of speculative parallelization systems like Galois, but it will also produce concurrent data structures for use in parallel systems that do not use speculation, such as OpenMP or pThreads. By simplifying one of the most complex aspects of parallel programming, namely the production of high-performance parallel data structures, Autograph will have a transformative effect on the critical field of parallel programming.","title":"SHF: Small: Autograph: A System for Synthesizing Concurrent Data Structure Implementations","awardID":"1218568","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["556730"],"PO":["564588"]},"192459":{"abstract":"Researchers at Florida International University (IIS-1213026), University of Illinois at Chicago (IIS-1213013), Brown University (IIS-1212508), and Northwestern University (IIS-1213038) are developing a high-performance model for information processing and fusion in mobile environments, providing a collaborative integration between the real and virtual worlds. This model, applicable to the fields of computational transportation and mobile sensing, enables querying and visualization of moving objects data (MOD) and their relationship to static and dynamic geospatial data.

This project explores a fundamentally new approach to malware detection that promises to be faster, more effective, and cheaper than current tools.<br\/><br\/>The evolution of malicious software, or malware, has seen increases in both malware's capabilities and sheer volume. Recent malware makes use of a number of sophisticated technologies including polymorphism, public key encryption, and peer-to-peer architectures. These advances are driven by significant resources put into malware development by both criminal enterprises and countries. Traditional malware detection tools rely on slow manual processes and the recent advances in malware have outrun the ability of existing tools to cope.<br\/><br\/>This project uses a new approach to the malware crisis that centers around constructive use of crowd-sourcing. The key insight is that the collection of machines on the Internet contains information that can be used to automatically classify software as either legitimate or malicious. This information includes not only the behavior of malware on individual machines but also the behavior of the aggregate population. For example, the aggregate statistics of how software propagates across the network can provide insight into whether the software is malicious.<br\/><br\/>A key component of the proposed work is binary translation-based dynamic signatures. Traditional malware detection tools have used static signatures, but polymorphic techniques have made this approach significantly more difficult. The project employs binary translation to efficiently collect dynamic traces for both code execution and behavioral events such as network communication and then generate signatures for these traces.<br\/><br\/>The project significantly reduces the threats of malware to society, especially since software developed through the project is freely available.

When such conditions are followed, it becomes possible to detect where problems lie so they can be corrected. It also becomes possible to optimize the agents and their communications to improve performance. Cyber-physical systems (like robots, self-piloting aircraft, etc.) modify themselves to improve performance break those conditions in that some agent modules negotiate their own communications and decide their own actions, sometimes taking advantage of the physics of the world in ways we did not anticipate. This renders difficult application of standard engineering tools to accomplish critical fault diagnosis and design optimization.

But while sighted people can develop ways to quickly skim Web content in order to get the gist of the information and find what they need, blind users are stymied because they must rely on screen reader software with limited functionality to narrate content using computer-generated speech through a serial audio interface, which does not allow these users to find out what content is important before they listen to it. So, they either listen to all content or listen to the first part of each sentence or paragraph before skipping to the next. The PI's goal in this project is to address this problem by developing novel interfaces and algorithmic techniques for non-visual skimming that will empower people with visual impairments to access information on the Web significantly faster than is currently possible with state-of-the-art screen readers.<br\/><br\/>When skimming, sighted people quickly look through content and pick out keywords and relevant phrases. The PI's approach is to emulate this process and enable a computer-assisted skimming experience for screen-reader users. To this end, he will iteratively and concurrently pursue two research directions: designing interfaces for non-visual skimming, and developing algorithms to enable these interfaces. Through a process of participatory design interfaces will be derived for skimming with standard shortcut-driven screen-readers, touch-based devices, and simulated haptic surfaces, while algorithms for generating summaries will be created to support skimming of various types of Web content at different levels of granularity and speed. Controlled and in-situ real-world experiments will be conducted to evaluate the utility of the resulting interfaces and algorithms. Project outcomes will include an open-source skimming tool and reusable datasets of Web pages with annotations and summaries.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Technology to facilitate non-visual skimming will transform information access for visually impaired users while also contributing to the fields of natural language processing, machine learning, and Web information retrieval. Additionally, this research will help us better understand how a combination of touch and haptic interfaces can improve website navigation and skimming. Although not explored in this research, project outcomes will likely prove useful to people with other disabilities such as cognitive and motor impairments, and they may ultimately also be helpful to sighted people.","title":"HCC: Small: Non-Visual Skimming: Improving the Usability of Web Access for Blind People","awardID":"1218570","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[518366,518367],"PO":["565227"]},"196508":{"abstract":"This project will develop and evaluate a prototype system to provide on-line process monitoring and guidance to the performers of health care processes.

This project focuses on the development and testing of a sequence of robotic assistants that promote early crawling, creeping, and walking, along with a model of infant-robot interaction that encourages the continued practice of movement patterns that will ultimately lead to unassisted locomotion. Typically developing infants initially learn to crawl through the generation of spontaneous limb and trunk movements. Early in the process, these spontaneous movements transport the infant across the floor. The rewarding locomotory experience drives the infant to refine the movements to intentional and exploratory skills. Ultimately, the infant intentionally engages these skills to solve larger problems, such as obtaining an interesting toy or exploring the environment. Infants with conditions such as CP lack the muscle strength, postural control, and motor coordination necessary for these early exploratory limb and trunk movements to result in locomotion. Without this positive feedback, the development of the neural pathways for productive limb use is diminished, which results in delayed or lack of development of crawling and walking. These limitations in mobility negatively affect other domains of development such as perception and cognition, with effects being visible even into adulthood.<br\/><br\/>The robotic assistants to be developed in this project will aid the infant in developing locomotory skills by selectively supporting a portion of his\/her weight and providing artificial, rewarding locomotory experiences. The PI's approach to infant-robot interaction is to first instrument the infant with a set of sensors, allowing for reconstruction of the trunk and limb positions in real time. A semi-supervised clustering process will then identify a menu of canonical spatio-temporal limb and trunk movement patterns given observations of behavior that is exhibited by children who are either typically developing or at risk of developing CP. The robot will respond to the recognition of a canonical movement by assisting in the corresponding postural support and transport of the child. The PI's hypothesis is that this positive feedback will encourage the continued practice of the canonical movements, as well as their use in solving larger problems. The infant-robot interaction model will selectively reward specific canonical movements as different levels of capabilities are exhibited. As the child becomes proficient at using a simple movement to trigger robotic assistance, the robot will reduce (and ultimately eliminate) its response to that particular canonical movement. Other canonical movements that encode related, but more complex and\/or coordinated limb movements, will continue to be available. As the limb movements are mastered the vertical support will be reduced to encourage the infant to bear more of his\/her own weight. The hypothesis is that this early intervention approach will help to guide the child along a progressive developmental trajectory that will end with locomotory skills and muscle strength that require little or no assistance. EEG-based neuroimaging will be used to monitor the progression of the infant's development. The hypothesis is that the degree of proficiency of certain skills will be identifiable using the EEG index related to motor output. This information will be used to guide the semi-supervised clustering process, as well as the decision process for selectively rewarding certain canonical movements.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Equipping children with CP at an early age with locomotory skills will not only bring them more in line with typically developing children, but will also reduce their reliance on long-term care while increasing their success in self-help, in education, and in the workplace. The techniques will be applicable to a range of other childhood disorders (including Down Syndrome), to retraining patients following stroke, and to the creation of tunable gestural interfaces for intelligent prostheses.","title":"NRI-Small: Robot Assistants for Promoting Crawling and Walking in Children at Risk of Cerebral Palsy","awardID":"1208639","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8013","name":"National Robotics Initiative"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":["556038",513358,513359,513360],"PO":["565227"]},"191416":{"abstract":"The rodent vibrissal-trigeminal system is one of the most important models in neuroscience for the study of sensorimotor integration.

The system is expected to be transformative to biomechanics research, both as a direct measurement instrument of previously unreported joint kinematics and as input to state-of-the-art computational models. Moreover, the resulting research is also expected to be comprehensive in the combination of experimental and modeling capabilities (whole-body motion, electromyography and force measurements and musculoskeletal, finite element, and probabilistic modeling). Accurate measurement of kinematics using the instrument should contribute to create scientific advancements in orthopedics and implant design, assistive technologies, understanding injury mechanisms, rehabilitation, and motor control of human movement.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: <br\/>The instrument can greatly impact the capability to improve patient outcomes.

Second, the methodology and the infrastructure to develop the RPPA for exploiting the performance potentials of SSDs are established. The results of this project can transform the way SSDs are used in future computer systems for data-intensive applications.

The Expanding Computing Education Pathways (ECEP) Alliance builds on five years of work by the Commonwealth Alliance for IT Education (CAITE) and Georgia Computes! and on best practices in computing education, particularly those developed in the community of Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) Alliances. CAITE and Georgia Computes! have been successful in facilitating state-level systemic change that has improved the quality of computing education, broadened participation in computing, and increased the number of students in the pathway to computing and computing-intensive degrees. The partnership will determine the unique needs in other state\/regional computing education systems and develop approaches that address those needs. California and South Carolina were chosen as initial ECEP partner states because they have the population, institutions, workforce demand and individuals or organizations ready to work to institute reform.

Using Massachusetts, Georgia and some of the partner\/associate states and regions to test and refine practices, ECEP will work with NCWIT, STARS, CSTA and our cadre of experts to disseminate lessons learned and best practices through mechanisms such as Train-the-Trainer workshops, workshops on how to run sustainable and effective events (such as summer camps), and strategies for strengthening and aligning pathways and curricula. ECEP will train STARS Leaders to do effective outreach, partner with NCWIT to disseminate best practices and develop new resources for our partner and associate states, and provide data to inform national and local organizations on computing education issues in ECEP partner states and regions. Independent evaluation informs project decision making and develops processes and tools that are available to new partners. <br\/><br\/>The goal of ECEP is to have a significant impact on improving and broadening participation in computing education state by state. Increasing the number of computing and computing-intensive degree graduates, and the diversity of those graduates, requires systemic change to educational pathways. Students decide as early as pre-teens against computing as a career, but a quality high school computer science experience can change that decision. Underrepresented minority students may not gain access to quality computing education unless it is made available broadly in high schools. The diversity and reach of community colleges makes them attractive pathways for students if we can facilitate transfer and ensure success. For computing to be taken seriously in middle, high school and community and 4-year colleges requires that we define high school computing curricula, increase the number of well-trained, certified high school computing teachers, improve post-secondary degree programs, curricular alignment, advising, and retention, and generally promote K-20 computing education reform. ECEP state partners and regions should see significant improvements in their computing education, through public policy, outreach, or changes in the education system.

The project is being carried out in the context of an undergraduate innovative design course, and the investigative focus is on design of and learner capabilities when using interfaces and environments for expressing ideas in visual forms that capture explicit and tacit knowledge and that can be shared and the affordances for promoting learning of ideation and collaboration around such shared representations of knowledge. The technological innovation is a cyber-infrastructure hardware framework that includes touch tablets, walls, and a wiki combined with software for sketching and diagramming and the socio-technical system around it that enables the kinds of high-end collaborative \"play\" needed for innovative ideation. Research centers on promoting learning in design; promoting the cognition of ideation in a social learning environment; relationships between visual thinking, imagination, and externalization; and how such a technological framework transforms creation of design knowledge and learning. Foundations are in the constructivist theory of learning, the social constructivist view of social construction of knowledge, the design of natural user interfaces (NUIs), and the view that cognition is embodied in the artifacts and affordances of the environment. The PIs are taking an ecological approach to examining the environment to understand how its combination of factors influence design learning, specifically integrative visual thinking, collaboration, and innovation. <br\/><br\/>Research has established the important role of exploratory \"play\" in the development of creativity and cognition and the central role of such exploration in ideation, especially in ideation of innovative solutions to problems and design challenges. This project leverages the possibilities inherent in natural user interfaces (NUIs) for promoting the kinds of collaborative exploration of ideas that is essential for collaborative learning, problem solving, and design. The hardware infrastructure being designed enables groups to articulate ideas visually, share them, and refine them together around a large collaborative multi-touch interface, to access those visualizations from afar and annotate them textually, and to share those ideas broadly with classmates, team-mates, and others. Such an infrastructure provides a foundation for supporting project-based and design-based learning activities in formal learning environments in ways that give all team members chances to contribute appropriately, record the contributions of team-mates for teachers and other mentors to examine, allow sharing and advice from peers, mentors, and experts, and eventually allow automatical assessment, help,and advice. The proposed infrastructure has potential to be used across all ages, in formal and informal learning environments, and in the workplace.","title":"DIP: V-ICED Visually-Integrated Cyber Exploratorium for Design","awardID":"1227639","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8020","name":"Cyberlearning: Transforming Ed"}}],"PIcoPI":["553653",520980,"559568","526014"],"PO":["562669"]},"194749":{"abstract":"Cryptographers have invented many different types of encryption.

Sample questions include how to save space when storing encrypted copies of the same material in the cloud, and how to encrypt a credit-card number by reimagining the process as the shuffling of a deck of cards. The research demonstrates the practical benefits to cryptography and security from inclusive reinterpretations what encryption does.<br\/><br\/>In more detail, leaky encryption formalizes what it means to divulge some particular function of the message, unifying notions like blockciphers, online ciphers, and order-preserving encryption. Shuffle-based encryption creates blockciphers in a way fundamentally different from the way Feistel and SP networks do. Message-locked encryption can encrypt with a key derived from the message itself, to enable secure de-duplication. Password-based encryption incorporates a \"salt\" to provide what the PIs call multi-instance security. Circuit encryption can encrypt a circuit and its input to ciphertexts that permit the evaluation of the one on the other, but in a way that reveals only correctly computed result.

Insects, in fact, build a \"natural\" sensor network through the use of their biological sensing organs and release of chemical, mechanical and optical cues to communicate the information to the rest of the group. In the scope of this project, a novel cyber-physical communication network will be established among the individual insect in addition to the aforementioned natural one. For this, insects will be equipped with synthetic electronic sensors to sense additional cues, neuromuscular stimulation systems to direct the control of the insect and microcontrollers with radios to establish an RF link between the insects. This novel network will enable operation of insect biobots in complicated and uncertain dynamic environments for applications such as environmental sensing and search-and-rescue operations after natural disasters. <br\/><br\/>The unique interdisciplinary nature of this project will help engineers to reach to younger generations and train them to be able to look at engineering problems from a cyberphysical systems point of view.

Many of the attacks on identity privacy use psychological influence strategies (\"psychological attacks?) to induce individuals to provide their private information. Although people are appropriately concerned about their privacy, they often unnecessarily disclose information that could be used to their disadvantage. Our studies have shown that people?s privacy exposure behaviors may be severely affected by psychological attacks. Unfortunately, research from a psychological perspective to mitigate the attacks is scarce. This research identifies critical aspects of warnings for a sub-set of psychological cyber-attacks on privacy and provides guidelines for developing effective mitigations against other types of psychological cyber-attacks. We create computer-mediated countermeasures. We also ascertain the extent to which the warnings capture attention, are understood, are memorable, increase perceptions of risk, decrease trust, and lead to compliance under conditions of psychological attacks. <br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit. This research is a first investigation of whether theoretical models developed to reduce risky behaviors (e.g., health-related behaviors) can be extended to the domain of computer privacy.

Specifically, in astrophysics the storage will allow an increase in dimensionality to perform full 3D modeling of shock formation; in civil and environmental engineering, it will enable the analysis of higher resolution water condition data in both time and space; in mechanical and aerospace engineering, the instrument will facilitate rigorous physical modeling of rate constants for biofuel combustion and fundamental understanding of molecular adsorptions; and in physics it will enable the modeling of gravitational waves and compact object mergers considering a broader range of physics. More generally, the system will enable projects across many disciplines in computational science and engineering.<br\/>Since data storage and access have become a bottleneck hampering researchers in the TIGRESS systems, the proposed system should contribute to remove the bottleneck. Understanding that data growth will continue, a modular storage system design has been chosen that will allow the system to grow in capacity and performance as the data deluge continuous to mount.

CAITE and Georgia Computes! have been successful in facilitating state-level systemic change that has improved the quality of computing education, broadened participation in computing, and increased the number of students in the pathway to computing and computing-intensive degrees. The partnership will determine the unique needs in other state\/regional computing education systems and develop approaches that address those needs. California and South Carolina were chosen as initial ECEP partner states because they have the population, institutions, workforce demand and individuals or organizations ready to work to institute reform.

ECEP will train STARS Leaders to do effective outreach, partner with NCWIT to disseminate best practices and develop new resources for our partner and associate states, and provide data to inform national and local organizations on computing education issues in ECEP partner states and regions.

Increasing the number of computing and computing-intensive degree graduates, and the diversity of those graduates, requires systemic change to educational pathways. Students decide as early as pre-teens against computing as a career, but a quality high school computer science experience can change that decision. Underrepresented minority students may not gain access to quality computing education unless it is made available broadly in high schools. The diversity and reach of community colleges makes them attractive pathways for students if we can facilitate transfer and ensure success. For computing to be taken seriously in middle, high school and community and 4-year colleges requires that we define high school computing curricula, increase the number of well-trained, certified high school computing teachers, improve post-secondary degree programs, curricular alignment, advising, and retention, and generally promote K-20 computing education reform. ECEP state partners and regions should see significant improvements in their computing education, through public policy, outreach, or changes in the education system.

Many in the CS community hypothesize that the absence of a computer and the social of the Unplugged activities make CS Unplugged especially engaging for female and under-represented minority students who tend to have less experience and confidence with computing concepts. But what is the impact of Unplugged on students?

For example, does participation in CS Unplugged activities actually have a positive impact on students' interest (especially women and underrepresented minorities) in pursuing computing as a major or career? Can exposure to CS concepts in a more accessible format (i.e., with no computers) increase students' confidence that they are able to learn the fundamentals required to continue in the field?

The PIs are developing a new approach to preventing coercion attacks using the concept of implicit learning from cognitive psychology. Implicit learning refers to learning of patterns without any conscious knowledge of the learned pattern. Using a carefully crafted keyboard-based computer game the PIs plant a secret password in the participant's brain without the participant having any conscious knowledge of the trained password. This planted secret can be used for authentication, but participants cannot be coerced into revealing their secret since they have no conscious knowledge of it. <br\/><br\/>This project explores three directions for using implicit learning in computer security. First, the PIs are developing implicit learning tasks designed to be used in challenge-response authentication. Second, the PIs are experimenting with methods to demonstrate implicit knowledge by measuring electrical activity along the scalp using off the shelf EEG devices. Third, the PIs are conducting user experiments to demonstrate that participants are able to properly authenticate, but cannot consciously recognize the trained secret. This project is a collaboration between computer security researchers and cognitive psychologists. Ultimately, the project aims to understand how the brain represents implicit knowledge. This in turn will lead to new coercion resistant security mechanisms for high-security applications.","title":"TWC: Medium: Collaborative: Neuroscience Meets Computer Security: Designing Systems Secure Against Coercion Attacks","awardID":"1228357","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2016-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"8060","name":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace"}}],"PIcoPI":[521284,521285],"PO":["565239"]},"196808":{"abstract":"The University of Washington and Oregon State University will investigate how to teach debugging and computing skills in personalized, social, online learning settings.

This research will develop an \"Intelligent Workcell,\" which augments the traditional robotic workcell with perception systems that observe workers within the workspace. Methods to explicitly track workers and estimate their body pose will enable dynamically adaptive safety zones surrounding the robot, thereby preventing the robot from injuring workers. Algorithms will be developed to recognize the activities that workers are performing. These algorithms will learn a task-independent vocabulary of fundamental action components, which will form the building blocks for a hierarchical activity recognition framework.

Furthermore, new manufacturing processes that involve robots and people working together on a single task would be enabled.

Learning of mathematics for students with visual impairments and blindness, including algebra, is especially difficult, as it requires finding and describing patterns, making generalizations about numbers, and using symbols and models to represent patterns. Rather than relying on visual cues, students with visual impairments must compensate using other senses and cognitive abilities to understand and apply concepts that typical students merely observe. This EAGER project is designed to lay the groundwork for investigating in real-world classroom settings which kinds of auditory and tactile representations will promote conceptual learning in mathematics. The PIs are designing and refining a platform that allows audio and other interactions, both for communicating with the learner and for the learner to use to express him\/herself. The platform makes math materials accessible to the visually impaired and gives them ways of expressing their math understanding. The functionality built into the platform also allows interactions between visually-impaired students and remote math teachers who specialize in teaching math to those who are blind and visually impaired. Research explores the impact on the learning of algebra when students are provided output and input of math auditorily via a computer as compared to traditional methods of interaction and explores, as well, the affordances and weaknesses of different input and output modalities. This will provide a baseline of difficulties in grasping math concepts that still remain; the intention is that research on explicitly promoting learning will come after.<br\/><br\/><br\/>Learning of mathematics for students with visual impairments and blindness is especially difficult. For most students with visual impairments, the primary issues with learning mathematics, particularly advanced mathematics, is due to the highly visual nature of the curriculum. Algebra, a gateway course to other STEM disciplines, is particularly visual. Therefore, many capable students with visual impairments are never afforded the opportunity to complete advanced mathematics courses such as algebra, thus impeding their prospects for success in STEM-related fields. This project addresses first steps in ameliorating these problems, putting in place input and output technologies that give visually impaired students better access to the concepts of math and identifying which difficulties in learning the concepts of mathematics remain. This work has potential to inform on ways to help those with visual impairments more easily learn mathematics; its findings may also uncover new ways of helping those without impairments but who find the abstractions of mathematics difficult alternative means of learning mathematics more easily. This project represents work in its early states on an untested but potentially transformative idea and is likely to catalyze rapid and innovative advances in the development of technologies for helping the blind and visually impaired better grasp abstract mathematical concepts.","title":"EAGER: Promoting algebra learning through an accessible expression system for students with visual impairments and blindness","awardID":"1258446","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2014-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8020","name":"Cyberlearning: Transforming Ed"}}],"PIcoPI":[536658,536659],"PO":["562669"]},"199070":{"abstract":"Funds are requested to support students at U.S. institutions to attend the 18th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (MobiCom 2012), which will be held August 22-26, 2012 in Istanbul, Turkey.

Such acoustic models may suffer from data sparsity and may fail to capture coarticulation appropriately because the span of a tri- or quin-phone's contextual influence is not flexible. In a small vocabulary context, however, research has shown that ASR systems which estimate articulatory gestures from the acoustics and incorporate these gestures in the ASR process can better model coarticulation and are more robust to noise. The current project investigates the use of estimated articulatory gestures in large vocabulary automatic speech recognition. Gestural representations of the speech signal are initially created from the acoustic waveform using the Task Dynamic model of speech production. These data are then used to train automatic models for articulatory gesture recognition where the articulatory gestures serve as subword units in the gesture-based ASR system. The main goal of the proposed work is to evaluate the performance of a large-vocabulary gesture-based ASR system using American English (AE).

The robust and accurate ASR system for AE resulting from the proposed project will deal effectively with speech variability, thereby significantly enhancing communication and collaboration between people and machines in AE, and with the promise to generalize the method to multiple languages.

While there is no broad agreement on the potential solutions, structural reform is on the horizon. The meaningful use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is seen as a key to improving efficiency. Technology solutions including miniaturized implantable medical devices, networked home monitoring devices, and the ubiquitous use of smart phones are starting to enable continuous real-time monitoring of patients as they go about their daily lives. Rich data from these devices form an electronic Personal Health Record (PHR) that captures patient health in a much finer time-scale than the EHR. The health care system, however, is not well equipped to benefit from the impending deluge of personalized health-related data in order to improve health outcomes and reduce costs. This proposal puts forth a comprehensive and systematic approach to intelligently process such data aiming at preventing hospitalization, empowering patients to actively participate in managing their health, assessing quality of care, and facilitating cost-effective epidemiology in the emerging data-rich environment. In the proposed framework, early risk assessment starts with algorithms for mining EHR and PHR data to classify patients in terms of the risk they have for developing an acute condition that would require hospitalization and\/or incur large costs. Risk stratification produced by our approach triggers a set of actions, including tests, additional and more intensive monitoring, and physician involvement. As part of this dynamic health management process, patients can have access to tools that enable their active participation in the daily management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes. Our plans include the development of algorithms that leverage experts? opinions to assess quality of care and the development of a distributed epidemiology approach suitable for the emerging landscape where lots of data about each patient are distributed among many different locations.<br\/><br\/>The proposed work has the potential to achieve revolutionary improvements in the quality of health care. Risk assessment combined with intelligent management of chronic conditions can prevent acute health episodes and dramatically improve health outcomes. Having rigorous and scalable ways of assessing the quality of care has the potential to reduce medical errors and improve coordination among health care providers. On the educational front, plans include new courses, training a diverse set of graduate students, involving undergraduate students, actively collaborating with medical doctors, and reaching out to high school students through existing programs embraced by the PIs.

Unfortunately a predictable environment also aids attackers since a small set of exploits can be applied across a large number of similarly configured computers. A Moving Target (MT) strategy can be used to address this problem by deploying less deterministic and homogenous systems.

The technique discovers better solutions (configurations) by mimicking processes found in nature. Computer configurations are modeled as chromosomes, where configuration parameters, or settings, are individual chromosome traits. The GA proceeds by applying a series of selection, crossover, and mutation processes to discover new chromosomes from a pool. Since the system constantly evolves, it is designed to cope with new vulnerabilities or functionalities that can be potentially introduced over time.<br\/><br\/>An important objective is the development a prototype MT system that can provide a better understanding of the performance of evolutionary-based configuration management.

However, despite these improvements we are still far from true interactive photorealism. In this research, the investigators develop a novel framework for computer graphics that improves the speed and quality of existing algorithms by leveraging ideas from the emerging field of compressed sensing.

The investigators apply the ideas of compressed sensing in order to take advantage of the sparsity in the transform domain and sample the signal in an efficient manner. This results in a framework that can be used to accelerate rendering algorithms by reconstructing the final image from a sparse set of samples using greedy optimization algorithms. The same framework can also be used to accelerate the acquisition of light transport which is useful for relighting applications.

For many such conditions, early diagnosis is the key for successful intervention and maximized wellness, and accurate mobility assessment is central to monitoring progression and evaluating the impact of physical and pharmaceutical therapies. In recent years, inertial body sensor networks (BSNs) have emerged as platforms with the potential to provide continuous, non-invasive collection of high-precision motion data in any location over an extended period of time. Up to now these have been used primarily in-clinic, making absolute assessments from data collected challenging. Out-of-clinic collections introduce nuisance variables, which exacerbate the problem.

The initial focus is on Twitter data associated with the social movement that began as \"Occupy Wall Street\" but broadens to include other venues and even other topics. This research will both develop tools for social media research and demonstrate how these tools improve our capabilities for research in this social media space. <br\/><br\/>Social media platforms are transforming how we work, live together, and govern ourselves. The many modalities offered by social media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook create a complex infrastructure, resulting in a dynamic ecosystem of information flows within and across platforms and among individuals and groups. The resulting socio-technical system enables both rapid and emergent organizational and relational transformations, but its scope and dynamic structure present conceptual and practical challenges for researchers studying the mechanisms of the transformations. The combination of volume, scope, complexity, and ephemeral nature of message flows require an interdisciplinary approach to developing research methods and tools for curating, processing, storing, and analyzing that go beyond the typical relational database management approaches.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit of the research is two-fold. First, the research will combine knowledge of social science, political science, communications, geography, information science, and emerging computing techniques to create a scalable and affordable approach to the selective collection and analysis of data from the huge flows of tweets, \"likes,\" and links associated with the Occupy movement. The approach will be documented and made available as an open source toolkit for other social media researchers, thus enabling a wider scope of inquiry. Second, the research will contribute to knowledge about grass-roots movements, using the Occupy movement as a currently active example that can serve as a test case, by examining the relationships of tweets, geography, and the possible linkages to other groups. The emerging information ecosystem of networks and linkages enabled by social media supplement traditional media such as newspapers and television, and messages may \"go viral,\" crossing community and geographic boundaries with unprecedented speed and quickly reaching remote and previously unconnected audiences. This work will provide new insights into the mechanisms by which these viral events occur and will help us understand the impact viral events can have on public participation in political discourse. <br\/><br\/>The broader impact of the research is both immediate and cumulative. The toolkit for data curation, analysis, and visualization has the potential for transforming the research questions social and information scientists can investigate using large datasets resulting from social media. These tools can enable us to envision different frameworks within which to understand how new social media communities form and engage in the broader public discourse. In this way, the research can transform how we think about and study the role of grass roots endeavors in community formation and change. The techniques developed through this research will lower the technical barriers and costs encountered by other researchers and observers who conduct their own research on such datasets. The research engages a new generation of researchers at both the doctoral and undergraduate levels. Graduate students working on the project will be developing the approach and methods and will be gaining experience in managing undergraduate students who work on the team. The experience of working on a truly transformative effort can inspire them and give them confidence to try risky and emergent efforts in the future, and they can be leaders in what may become an interdisciplinary area of study of large social media datasets.","title":"INSPIRE: Tools, Models, and Innovation Platforms for Research on Social Media","awardID":"1243170","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0405","name":"Division of OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE","abbr":"SES"},"pgm":{"id":"8078","name":"INSPIRE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7953","name":"SOCIAL-COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0804","name":"Division of EMERGING FRONTIERS","abbr":"EF"},"pgm":{"id":"1371","name":"POLITICAL SCIENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["559720"],"PO":["564456"]},"196085":{"abstract":"The US health care system spends major resources on the treatment of acute conditions in a hospital setting rather than focusing on prevention and keeping patients out of the hospital.

Rich data from these devices form an electronic Personal Health Record (PHR) that captures patient health in a much finer time-scale than the EHR. The health care system, however, is not well equipped to benefit from the impending deluge of personalized health-related data in order to improve health outcomes and reduce costs. This proposal puts forth a comprehensive and systematic approach to intelligently process such data aiming at preventing hospitalization, empowering patients to actively participate in managing their health, assessing quality of care, and facilitating cost-effective epidemiology in the emerging data-rich environment. In the proposed framework, early risk assessment starts with algorithms for mining EHR and PHR data to classify patients in terms of the risk they have for developing an acute condition that would require hospitalization and\/or incur large costs. Risk stratification produced by our approach triggers a set of actions, including tests, additional and more intensive monitoring, and physician involvement. As part of this dynamic health management process, patients can have access to tools that enable their active participation in the daily management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes. Our plans include the development of algorithms that leverage experts? opinions to assess quality of care and the development of a distributed epidemiology approach suitable for the emerging landscape where lots of data about each patient are distributed among many different locations.<br\/><br\/>The proposed work has the potential to achieve revolutionary improvements in the quality of health care. Risk assessment combined with intelligent management of chronic conditions can prevent acute health episodes and dramatically improve health outcomes. Having rigorous and scalable ways of assessing the quality of care has the potential to reduce medical errors and improve coordination among health care providers. On the educational front, plans include new courses, training a diverse set of graduate students, involving undergraduate students, actively collaborating with medical doctors, and reaching out to high school students through existing programs embraced by the PIs. Dissemination plans include capitalizing on the BU Sensor Network Consortium and organizing a major medical informatics workshop.","title":"SHB: Type II (INT): Collaborative Research: Algorithmic Approaches to Personalized Health Care","awardID":"1237136","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2017-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8018","name":"Smart Health & Wellbeing"}}],"PIcoPI":[525606],"PO":["565136"]},"196096":{"abstract":"Information technology, advances in statistical computing, and the deluge of data available through the Internet are transforming computational social science.

Such acoustic models may suffer from data sparsity and may fail to capture coarticulation appropriately because the span of a tri- or quin-phone's contextual influence is not flexible. In a small vocabulary context, however, research has shown that ASR systems which estimate articulatory gestures from the acoustics and incorporate these gestures in the ASR process can better model coarticulation and are more robust to noise. The current project investigates the use of estimated articulatory gestures in large vocabulary automatic speech recognition. Gestural representations of the speech signal are initially created from the acoustic waveform using the Task Dynamic model of speech production. These data are then used to train automatic models for articulatory gesture recognition where the articulatory gestures serve as subword units in the gesture-based ASR system. The main goal of the proposed work is to evaluate the performance of a large-vocabulary gesture-based ASR system using American English (AE). The gesture-based system will be compared to a set of competitive state-of-the-art recognition systems in term of word and phone recognition accuracies, both under clean and noisy acoustic background conditions.<br\/><br\/>The broad impact of this research is threefold: (1) the creation of a large vocabulary American English (AE) speech database containing acoustic waveforms and their articulatory representations, (2) the introduction of novel machine learning techniques to model articulatory representations from acoustic waveforms, and (3) the development of a large vocabulary ASR system that uses articulatory representation as subword units. The robust and accurate ASR system for AE resulting from the proposed project will deal effectively with speech variability, thereby significantly enhancing communication and collaboration between people and machines in AE, and with the promise to generalize the method to multiple languages. The knowledge gained and the systems developed will contribute to the broad application of articulatory features in speech processing, and will have the potential to transform the fields of ASR, speech-mediated person-machine interaction, and automatic translation among languages. The interdisciplinary collaboration will facilitate a cross-disciplinary learning environment for the participating faculty, researchers, graduate students and undergraduate students Thus, this collaboration will result in the broader impact of enhanced training in speech modeling and algorithm development. Finally, the proposed work will result in a set of databases and tools that will be disseminated to serve the research and education community at large.","title":"RI: Medium: Collaborative Research: Multilingual Gestural Models for Robust Language-Independent Speech Recognition","awardID":"1162046","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2014-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}}],"PIcoPI":[508324],"PO":["565215"]},"198065":{"abstract":"Traffic congestion is a global challenge. Besides the obvious energy and environmental impacts, traffic congestion imposes tangible costs on society. It is unlikely that traditional physically-centered mitigation strategies by themselves will be successful or sustainable in the current economical and environmental climate. Numerous strategies have been proposed to construct Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), by incorporating sensing, information, and communication technologies in transportation infrastructure and vehicles. In this EAGER proposal, we present an early-concept exploration to investigate an innovative and transformative approach for ITS. We envision that this exploratory research could advance the next generation of ITSs by introducing a tightly-integrated real-time traffic simulation, estimation, and visualization for traffic management. We are developing novel hybrid methods for real-time flow estimation, traffic reconstruction and visualization, as well as designing GPU and many-core algorithms to accelerate the overall performance.<br\/><br\/>If successful, this research could enable adaptive route planning for vehicle guidance and navigational aid to alleviate traffic congestion through an algorithmic lens.

But we have little concrete understanding of the cognitive and communicative basis of such systematic change. Central to the proposed research are two questions: a) Does the constrained and trajectorial nature of semantic change derive from the organizational properties of the neurocognitive system? b) How precisely is the actuation and the implementation of instances of such changes rooted in the dynamics of rational communication? By simultaneously addressing these questions from the perspectives of linguistic structure, conceptual structure, brain-functional structure, and communication structure, the investigators hope to develop a cognitively grounded, experimentally viable, and mathematically informed theory of semantic change.<br\/><br\/>Two cross-linguistically well-attested paths of change have been identified as being especially relevant in probing the potential connections between language, cognition and communication: (a) the path whereby locative expressions diachronically evolve to express possession, ultimately evolving into dative case markers; (b) the path whereby copulas or linking verbs arise from posture verbs (e.g., sit, stand) to encode the distinction between incidental\/temporary and essential\/permanent attribution of properties, generalizing at a later stage to encode both types of attribution. On the one hand, by experimentally studying the processing and neurological aspects of these semantic notions, the team will probe the interface between language and cognition -- specifically the connection to percept-based and non-percept-based dimensions of the conceptual system. These results will facilitate a better understanding of the cognitive pathways that organize the infrastructure of the conceptual system, particularly the prefrontal cortex. On the other hand, insights obtained from formal linguistic models, semantic change phenomena, and cognitive psychology, will be combined with ideas from engineering and statistics to formulate at least the beginnings of a probabilistic theory of semantic information, which models how information is exchanged in linguistic discourse.<br\/><br\/>As envisaged, this project promises to have broader impact at two levels: First, it will liberate phenomena conventionally restricted to one small subfield in Linguistics and transform them into tools for investigating the fundamental mechanisms from which they emerge, making them relevant for Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, and Information Theory. It will also open up direct channels for a possible synthesis between the rich (but relatively messy) empirical facts of real language and abstract theories of communication, paving a path towards a Semantic Information Theory. Second, it will afford a cleaner understanding of how cognitive pathways guide the evolution of language in the linguistically typical (i.e., neurocognitively healthy) population. This, in turn, has direct implications for research on linguistically atypical populations. In both these ways, the project will redefine the boundaries between linguistics, information theory, cognitive science, and neuroscience and lead to new methodologies for studying semantics, cognition and information. The proposed research will also lead to the creation of a novel educational and research approach: the study of language change from an information-theoretic and neurocognitive perspective.","title":"INSPIRE: The underpinnings of Semantic change: A Linguistic, Cognitive, and Information-Theoretic Investigation","awardID":"1248100","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2016-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0405","name":"Division of OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE","abbr":"SES"},"pgm":{"id":"8078","name":"INSPIRE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7797","name":"COMM & INFORMATION FOUNDATIONS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"1311","name":"LINGUISTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":[531902,531903,"564929","535038"],"PO":["564924"]},"200364":{"abstract":"The purpose of the project is to provide rapid response to natural disasters by developing a situation aware virtual information observatory to extreme events occurring anywhere in the world.

For example, it is now commonplace for software to control the engines and brakes in our cars. This research investigates a new approach for improving the resilience of software. The goal is to verify that hidden bugs cannot cause programs to transition into problematic states in which they stop responding to human control or respond differently than when they were tested. Given the scale that our society depends on software in critical roles, new approaches to improving software resilience have the potential to reduce the financial costs of software failures and even save lives.<br\/><br\/>Previous work on software resilience largely focused on extensive testing or formal verification of correctness. This project takes a new approach - it seeks to verify that the consequences of a software error have a limited scope in time. Precisely, it verifies that after a bounded time period after an error, the execution will reach a state in which it will respond with same behaviors seen while testing. This property is known in the distributed systems literature as self-stabilization. The project will combine type annotations with compiler analyses to verify that a computation is self-stabilizing. A second thrust of the project is to explore how to compose self-stabilizing computations with stateful computations while still providing useful system level guarantees.","title":"SHF: Small: Tool Support for Verifiably-Robust Software","awardID":"1217854","effectiveDate":"2012-10-01","expirationDate":"2015-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["550574"],"PO":["565264"]},"194380":{"abstract":"This proposal addresses the hardware, control and planning technologies required to achieve soft robotic systems, in order to offer inherent safety and adaptation to the human-machine systems of the future.

The proposed research will address the algorithmic and device-level challenges that arise in the design of soft compliant robots capable of pose-invariant and shape-invariant grasping. A combination of algorithmic solutions to modeling, control, planning, and adaptation will lead to new soft compliant manipulators that do not need accurate geometric models for grasping.

The microsurgical virtual environment will enable students to learn the appropriate way of handling the soft tissues and developing the needed surgical skills needed to become competent micro surgeons. Currently, surgical training is usually limited face-to-face situations where the expert surgeon and the trainees are in the same room performing intricate procedures, typically on cadavers. Since the experts in microsurgical techniques are not available in most parts of the country, such training is not readily available to many medical students.
