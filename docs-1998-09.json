{"33709":{"abstract":"The goal of this research project, a collaborative award with IIS-9812764, is to create and disseminate a software infrastructure for building complex and large-scale information systems that are both distributed and robust. The path to such systems lies in viewing distributed information systems as multi-agent systems: computational organizations consisting of potentially hundreds of intelligent real-time agents. Robust information systems will adapt both their functions and performance in response to changes in system goals, changes in performance requirements, and changes in the available software and hardware resources. A multi-agent architecture appropriate for such systems is being developed that contains component technologies for local agent scheduling, multi-agent coordination, organizational design, detection and diagnosis of inappropriate behavior in face of environmental change, and on-line learning to improve the performance of the other components. To evaluate this research, a multi-agent simulation testbed is being utilized to conduct extensive evaluation of the individual technologies, an integrated system prototype, and the issues of scalability to large agent societies. The impact of this work is to provide software, techniques and empirical studies that will facilitate the construction of the next generation of robust information systems.<br\/>http:\/\/dis.cs.umass.edu\/","title":"Enhancing Robustness of Information through Distributed Adaptive Coordination","awardID":"9812755","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6850","name":"DIGITAL SOCIETY&TECHNOLOGIES"}}],"PIcoPI":["562750","485591"],"PO":["495796"]},"23909":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT NCR-9714696 Zeger, Kenneth Institution: University of California - San Diego Title: Low Complexity Joint Source and Channel Coding ________________________________________________________________ The goal of the project is to develop effective joint source-channel coding techniques.

Very narrow bandwidth transmission channels, such as in mobile cellular telephony, require efficient coding schemes to protect the transmitted source information from the corruptive effects of channel errors. In particular, low complexity techniques are needed for low delay real time implementations.

This project is designed to automatically classify Web documents into subject headings of the Science (Q) and Technology (T) portions of the Library of Congress classification system, after being trained and tested on several thousand documents previously classified by library scientists and experienced document analysts. The system is an extension of a system which employs machine-learning methods combined with natural language processing and information retrieval techniques to produce descriptive phrases for journal articles in the domain of physical chemistry.

The current project establishes that these methods can be scaled up to address a much larger problem domain. In doing so it also addresses issues relevant to all of natural language processing and information retrieval (e.g., efficient use of contextual cues, and reduction of errors due to encountering vocabulary which is unknown to the system). Success in the project will significantly advance concept-based classification and demonstrate its applicability to the vast problem of finding information in the largely unclassified \"library\" that is the World Wide Web.

Numerous applications demand the availability of a scalable multicast service, including electronic software distribution, collaboration tools, multi-party video games, and distributed simulations. A major impediment for scalability of multicast applications is the need of multicast group members to exchange control information with each other. In this research project, a novel approach to the problem of scalable multicast is proposed where members of a multicast group are organized using a logical control structure with strong symmetrical properties, e.g., an n-dimensional hypercube. By exploiting the symmetry properties of the control structure, operations that require an exchange of feedback information between multicast group members can be efficiently implemented. The goal of the proposed project is to improve the scalability of multicast communications, and demonstrate that the feasibility to accommodate group sizes of several thousandmembers. Using analytical techniques, simulations, and measurement experiments, the fundamental limits and practical trade-offs of different approaches to structure large multicast groups will be investigated. A protocol prototype, called the HyperCast protocol, that maintains a logical hypercube in a packet switching network will be designed and implemented. If successful, the project will influence the currently ongoing research efforts on designing scalable multicast protocols. The solutions developed in this project will be applicable in many areas of computer science and engineering which require multicast communications, including parallel and distributed simulations, distributed information systems, global virtual databases, and meta-computing environments.","title":"HyperCast - Highly Scalable Multicast Communications","awardID":"9870336","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["263351"],"PO":["234222"]},"28084":{"abstract":"Many database applications today are no longer I\/O bound but memory bound - during transaction processing applications, the CPU wastes approximately 80% of its cycles waiting for fetches from memory.

This fact makes humans rely heavily on their visual sense for extracting information and learning about their surrounding, and for planning and executing purposeful acts. As a result, the need to reliably process and transmit visual data has become central to many applications. In particular, with the rapid development and migration of end-user applications and services towards transmission media which place high constraints on bandwidth, such as the Internet and wireless media, there is a growing need for the development of new efficient image and video compression techniques, which offer reduction in bit-rates and improvement in quality at low bit-rates. Although the importance of exploiting human perception has long been recognized within the signal and image processing community, the previous research efforts in image and video compression have concentrated on developing methods to minimize not perceptual but rather mathematically tractable, easy to measure, distortion criteria. While non- perceptual distortion measures were found to be reasonably reliable for higher bit-rates (high quality applications), they do not correlate well with the perceived quality at lower bit-rates and they fail to guarantee preservation of important perceptual qualities in the reconstructed images despite the potential for a good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our research interest is in developing adaptive perceptual-based image and video coding systems, which discriminate between signal components based on their perceptual relevance for achieving robustness and increased performance in terms of quality and bit-rate. Achieving this objective requires having reliable tools for predicting the sensitivity of the human visual system to distortions. The main objectives of this research can be summarized as follows: 1 . Investigate the spatio-temporal masking properties of the human visual system, and develop reliable techniques to adaptively measure the masking characteristics and perceptual relevancy of the different components contained in the visual source material.2. Derive a reliable tractable perceptual distortion metric for assessing visual quality at a local or global level. 3. Investigate adaptive quantizer designs based on the derived perceptual distortion metric.4. Develop and investigate robust perceptually-based lossless and lossy image and video coding techniques, with emphasis on audiovisual applications disseminated through highly constrained-bandwith communication systems. The research program is complemented by the education plan, in which a Signal and Image Processing Outreach Program is being developed to stimulate the interest of middle and high school students and undergraduates in engineering and science. Another main component of the educational plan is to integrate the research part into the educational process by incorporating some of the research activities in undergraduate and graduate courses as well as in undergraduate-oriented research projects, and by introducing new courses related to the research effort. Another goal is to research efficient ways to make use of technology in education.","title":"Adaptive Perceptual Coding of Visual Information","awardID":"9733897","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["359564"],"PO":["564898"]},"49084":{"abstract":"","title":"CAREER: Sensor Assimilation for Micromanipulation","awardID":"9996061","effectiveDate":"1998-09-14","expirationDate":"2003-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["196704"],"PO":["234178"]},"49030":{"abstract":"","title":"NSF Young Investigator Award","awardID":"9996005","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"1999-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["426630"],"PO":[125480]},"49162":{"abstract":"","title":"CAREER: Multimedia Analysis and Retrieval System","awardID":"9996140","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2004-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}}],"PIcoPI":["515756"],"PO":["563751"]},"49085":{"abstract":"","title":"An Investigation of Visually Guided Micromanipulation Using Active Optical Systems","awardID":"9996062","effectiveDate":"1998-09-14","expirationDate":"2000-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["507075",125601,"196704"],"PO":["234178"]},"37481":{"abstract":"This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program in research and development of specialized sensors and integrated devices.

The proposed work involves a strong interaction between experimental and analytical components, so that experimentally derived models can be used to design optimized algorithms, which can in turn be tested. For this purpose, radio, video, and test equipment is requested to complement existing facilities in the ultra-wideband radio lab (UltRa Lab). This equipment will be used for closely related research projects that support the development of fully mobile indoor video communication systems. The motivating wireless technology is spread-spectrum impulse radio which alleviates multipath problems, but must coexist in the same spectrum with signals in the frequency range from roughly 500 MHz to 2 GHz. The experiments are aimed at (1) quantifying the ability of different radio systems to coexist in the same band without mutually interfering, (2) quantifying the distortion properties of ultra-wideband antennas and propagation environments, and (3) measuring the effects of indoor radio performance anomalies on video transmissions. The equipment requested includes anechoic chamber components, a flexible software video compression system, high quality LANs that can be utilized in both the video and radio interference experiments, and a bit error-rate tester and other components necessary for interference and coexistence tests. These experiments will result in a database of channel measurements, which characterize propagation, antenna, and interference effects. The database will be used to extract statistical models which, in turn, will be used to develop algorithms for receiver signal processing and video rate control. This process of experimentation, model extraction, and algorithm development will be iterated throughout the duration of the requested support. Each of these experiments is briefly described below.<br\/><br\/>(1) Interference Rejection and Coexistence Experiments and Analysis (Scholtz and Chugg). This experimental work will explore the ability of impulse radio with power spectrum thinly spread roughly from 500 MHz to 2 GHz to coexist over short range channels with the myriad of other electronic systems in that broad spectrum. This effort will test coexistence with LANs, cordless phones, microwave ovens, wireless TV links, etc. The processing gain of the spread-spectrum techniques employed in the impulse radio will be checked and the dynamic range of current impulse radios will be tested. These experiments will determine the direction of research efforts on impulse radio implementation.<br\/><br\/>(2) Characterization of ultra-wideband antennas and propagation environment (Prata, Chugg, Scholtz). The experimental work to be carried out in the controlled environment of an anechoic chamber supports the characterization of ultra-wideband antennas for impulse radio, and the characterization of narrower-band antennas to evaluate their ability to receive\/reject impulses. This environment will be used to evaluate new UWB antenna designs that provide more robust spatial coverage, better pulse shaping characteristics, polarization diversity, and to study the propagation of UWB signals through different kinds of materials. The equipment purchased under this grant is destined for an anechoic chamber atleast 15' (w) x 15' (h) x 30' (l) to be constructed in the near future (architectural work on the building containing this chamber is beginning now).<br\/><br\/>(3) Experiments with Software-Compressed Asynchronous Video over UWB Wireless Links (Ortega, Chugg). Two stages are planned in the experimental work with robust asynchronous video transmission. In a first stage, laptops and wireless LAN equipment will be used to test techniques, which are currently under study for rate control over a time varying channel. All video functions (compression, rate control, error correction, retransmission, etc.) will be implemented in software. In a second stage the algorithms will be adapted to operate over an experimental impulse radio link. At that point the results from the initial stage will be incorporated and also changes needed for the particular transmission conditions of impulse radio will be implemented.<br\/><br\/>Each of the student researchers supported under the requested funding will be involved in all three of these aspects.

This proposal also requests four Silicon Graphics 02 client workstations, which will be used primarily for applications development, debugging, and data visualization. Together with equipment already on hand, the parallel server and client workstations will be set up as a network, which will also serve as the testbed for the High-performance Distributed Object Programming Environment Project. The goal of this project is to design a CORBA-based parallel\/distributed programming environment that will harness the combined power of the parallel server and the workstations to solve large scale parallel applications.","title":"MRI: Acquisition of a Scalable Parallel Supercomputer for the Science Vision Center","awardID":"9871088","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"1189","name":"MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["527654","164128","490399","551925"],"PO":["557609"]},"37472":{"abstract":"9870684<br\/>Miller, Barton P.<br\/>Livny, Miron<br\/>University of Wisconsin-Madison<br\/><br\/>Experimental Software Systems: Software Fondations for Experiment Management<br\/><br\/>The development of a high-performance parallel and networked system is an evolutionary process. Systems start with models and simulations and progress through a sequence of implementation steps. At each step, the key question is how and how much did the performance change? This question is important when we are comparing implementation to models or simulations, and when we change an implementation to run with a different algorithm, library, language, number of processors, type of network, input, work load, or scheduling algorithm. This project is developing an Experiment Management facility, called X-Man, to provide an infrastructure to directly attack these issues. This infrastructure will be of immediate use by system developers, and those developing models and simulation environments. It will provide a point of exchange, comparison, and reference for cooperating development groups, supporting collaborative, geographically distributed development. The benefits from X-Man include: (1) Directly support the code development process, providing programmers with concrete understanding of program evolution. (2) Change benchmarking from an ad- hoc activity to one with a quantitative, well-defined structure. (3) Provide both infrastructure and analysis to support model and simulation validation. (4) A framework to evaluate the effect of dynamic systems, analyzing behavioral differences caused by adaptive algorithms.","title":"Experimental Software Systems: Software Foundations for Experiment Management","awardID":"9870684","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4725","name":"EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS\/CADRE"}}],"PIcoPI":["560467","459025",94783],"PO":["179487"]},"29772":{"abstract":"Interconnect is rapidly becoming one of the most important factors in influencing the behavior of integrated circuits.

The investigation is carried out in a three-pronged plan. First, a study of counting problems in equational unification will attempt to identify the exact complexity of computing the number of minimal complete unifiers modulo an equational theory. This counting problem reflects more accurately the computational difficulties of equational unification than the corresponding decision problem does; moreover, it brings out certain differences between equational matching and unification that are masked, when only decision problems are considered. In the second part of the Investigation will be a systematic investigation of efficient listing algorithms in equational unification; these algorithms should enumerate all minimal complete unifiers of two given terms, but should also satisfy certain desirable performance guarantees, such as a reasonably bounded delay in listing any two consecutive unifiers. Progress in the area may lead to the discovery of novel unification algorithms and to the development of a rigorous methodology for comparing such algorithms. Finally, there will be an experimental investigation of associative-commutative matching problems; the main aim is to identify hard random instances of such problems and possibly to unveil threshold or phase-transition phenomena in associative- commutative matching. This investigation may also produce new benchmarks for the experimental evaluation of matching and unification algorithms.","title":"Automated Deduction and Computational Complexity","awardID":"9732041","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["518005"],"PO":["528421"]},"49165":{"abstract":"","title":"Experimental Software Systems: A Parallel Message-Passing Platform for Atomic Structure Calculations","awardID":"9996143","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"4080","name":"ADVANCED COMP RESEARCH PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"4725","name":"EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS\/CADRE"}}],"PIcoPI":[125789,125790,"540643"],"PO":[125792]},"28188":{"abstract":"Utilitarian reasoning has been an area of emerging interest in multi-agent systems. The research supported by this award is in this area, though it will make use of more classical concepts of symbolic reasoning as well. This project will investigate how non-cooperative game-theoretic tools and methods can be usefully applied to model the interactions of artificial computer-based agents. Since such agents must be programmed, the research must provide explicit models of how agents reason to a solution, a task which has never been addressed in traditional game theory. Game theory must be supplemented with representations in which actions, references, and rationality for agents can be defined, as well as with mechanical procedures that allow agents to compute solutions to their decision problems. This project aims to view agents as simple inferential machines that can derive a solution from a set of axioms and inference rules. Since agents may repeatedly interact, and thus may have a chance to learn from their environments, we need to provide them with belief revision tools and embed such tools into viable computational procedures.

The proposed<br\/>work involves a strong interaction between experimental and analytical<br\/>components, so that experimentally derived models can be used to design<br\/>optimized algorithms, which can in turn be tested. For this purpose, radio,<br\/>video, and test equipment is requested to complement existing facilities in<br\/>the ultra-wideband radio lab (UltRa Lab). This equipment will be used for<br\/>three closely related research projects that support the development of<br\/>fully mobile indoor video communication systems. The motivating wireless<br\/>technology is spread-spectrum impulse radio, which alleviates multipath<br\/>problems, but must coexist in the same spectrum with signals in the<br\/>frequency range from roughly 500 MHz to 2 GHz. The experiments are aimed at<br\/>(1) quantifying the ability of different radio systems to coexist in the<br\/>same band without mutually interfering, (2) quantifying the distortion<br\/>properties of ultra-wideband antennas and propagation environments, and (3)<br\/>measuring the effects of indoor radio performance anomalies on video<br\/>transmissions. The equipment requested includes anechoic chamber<br\/>components, a flexible software video compression system, high quality LANs<br\/>that can be utilized in both the video and radio interference experiments,<br\/>and a bit error rate tester and other components necessary for interference<br\/>and coexistence tests. These experiments will result in a database of<br\/>channel measurements which characterize propagation, antenna, and<br\/>interference effects. The database will be used to extract statistical<br\/>models which, in turn, will be used to develop algorithms for receiver<br\/>signal processing and video rate control. This process of experimentation,<br\/>model extraction, and algorithm development will be iterated throughout the<br\/>duration of the requested support. Each of these experiments is briefly<br\/>described below.<br\/>><br\/>>(1) Interference Rejection and Coexistence Experiments and Analysis<br\/>(Scholtz and Chugg). This experimental work will explore the ability of<br\/>impulse radio with power spectrum thinly spread roughly from 500 MHz to 2<br\/>GHz to coexist over short range channels with the myriad of other electronic<br\/>systems in that broad spectrum. This effort will test coexistence with<br\/>LANs, cordless phones, microwave ovens, wireless TV links, etc. The<br\/>processing gain of the spread spectrum techniques employed in the impulse<br\/>radio will be checked and the dynamic range of current impulse radios will<br\/>be tested. These experiments will determine the direction of research<br\/>efforts on impulse radio implementation.<br\/>><br\/>>(2) Characterization of ultra-wideband antennas and propagation<br\/>environment (Prata, Chugg, Scholtz). The experimental work to be carried<br\/>out in the controlled environment of an anechoic chamber supports the<br\/>characterization of ultra-wideband antennas for impulse radio, and the<br\/>characterization of narrower-band antennas to evaluate their ability to<br\/>receive\/reject impulses. This environment will be used to evaluate new UWB<br\/>antenna designs that provide more robust spatial coverage, better pulse<br\/>shaping characteristics, polarization diversity, and to study the<br\/>propagation of UWB signals through different kinds of materials. The<br\/>equipment purchased under this grant is destined for an anechoic chamber at<br\/>least 15' (w) x 15' (h) x 30' (l) to be constructed in the near future<br\/>(architectural work on the building containing this chamber is beginning<br\/>>now).<br\/>><br\/>>(3) Experiments with Software-Compressed Asynchronous Video over UWB<br\/>Wireless Links (Ortega, Chugg).

All<br\/>video functions (compression, rate control, error correction,<br\/>retransmission, etc.) will be implemented in software. In a second stage<br\/>the algorithms will be adapted to operate over an experimental impulse radio<br\/>link. At that point the results from the initial stage will be incorporated<br\/>and also changes needed for the particular transmission conditions of<br\/>impulse radio will be implemented.<br\/>><br\/>><br\/>>Each of the student researchers supported under the requested funding will<br\/>be involved in all three of these aspects.

This project develops testbed hardware and algorithms to coordinate the actuators to transport and manipulate objects. The theoretical contributions add to the existing literature on distributed manipulation, much of which addresses chip-scale actuators. The MDMS works on a macroscopic scale, where physical models are more tractable. In contrast to MEMS actuator arrays, where mass and friction are essentially ignored, the MDMS not only incorporates friction and mass, but also explicitly exploits them. This effort considers two primary operation modes: sensorless and sensor-based. Sensorless operation is easier to implement and analyze but does not provide the precision of sensor-based control. The MDMS also provides a testbed for evaluating distributed control strategies, and this research considers the tradeoff between centralized and decentralized control approaches.

The rapid growth and change of computing and digital communication taxes scientific and engineering endeavors involving computation. The research builds upon an innovative service model in which the distributed system customizes itself to better the fulfillment of user and application requirements. In this model, a user is no longer an entity that is local to one specific machine -- each user is a machine-independent entity that exists in the network and can transparently carry its profile across different hardware and software. A network-centric operating system manages and allocates the resources to support the user on heterogeneous platforms. Resource management encompasses a framework for architecture-awareness. This forms the basis for adaptable quality of service, dynamic security, and self-configuration. The approach supports distributed desktops, mobile workspaces, and legacy applications across a spectrum of resources including mobile Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), embedded systems, workstations, and supercomputers using wired and wireless communications media.

Brown, Maxine D. University of Illinois Chicago MRI: Instrumentation Development for Human-Centered Tele-Immersion The Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago has developed an aggressive program over the past decade to partner with dozens of computations scientists and engineers all over the Nation. The focus of this effort has been to create visualization and virtual reality (VR) devices and applications for collaborative exploration of scientific and engineering data. Since 1995, the EVL research and development activities have incorporated emerging high bandwidth networks like the vBNS, in an effort now called Tele-Immersion. As a result of past experience in building first and second generation VR devices to support these applications, the EVL now wishes to conduct research in third-generation VR devices to construct variable resolution and desktop\/office-sized displays. Since no current technology is yet configurable with ideal resolution and size, there is a need to simulate these devices with available parts, and then build more advanced prototypes. This proposal requests significant equipment funds to buy, evaluate, and integrate a variety of emerging display devices, such as large color plasma displays, LCD projectors, LED panels, Feffo-electric Liquid Crystal displays and Digital Macro Mirror Displays. This proposal also requests funds to purchase new workstations for use by the EVL's 50+ students, and dozen faculty and staff.

This premier program emphasizes the importance the National Science Foundation places on the early development of academic careers dedicated to stimulating the discovery process in which the excitement of research is enhanced by inspired teaching and enthusiastic learning. It combines in a single program the support of research and education of the highest quality and in the broadest sense. The research activity involves the use of ultrasound-modulated optical tomography (USMOT), a novel system combining an ultrasonic transducer and a laser system, to study the acousto- optical effects in liquid and gel turbid media (e.g. biological tissues). The specific tasks of the activity include: 1) computer modeling of turbid acousto-optics; 2) effects of the ultrasonic wave on the ultrasound modulation of light; 3) effects of the light source on the ultrasound modulation of light; 4) effects of the relative configuration between the ultrasonic wave and light on the ultrasound modulation of light; 5) effects of the acoustic and optical properties and geometry of the media; and 6) characterization and optimization of images of turbid media. The educational plan aims to directly involve students in the research, with specific goals including the development of a new course in Optical Imaging, expansion of an existing course in Medical Imaging, and outreach to pre-college students through the Texas A&M Summer Student Program.

Agent congregations are defined by commitments to common semantics and ontologies (conceptualizations of the world).

The result will be another step toward achieving the goals of a theory of commonsense knowledge and reasoning - the reasoning processes used by humans in everyday life, rather than just the reasoning used in mathematical theorems. http:\/\/www.cs.utexas.edu\/users\/vl\/","title":"Formalization and Automation of Reasoning about Actions","awardID":"9732744","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6856","name":"ARTIFICIAL INTELL & COGNIT SCI"}}],"PIcoPI":["337516"],"PO":["491702"]},"37564":{"abstract":"EIA-9871022 Cooperman, Gene Kaeli, David R. Northeastern University MRI: A High-Performance, Low-Cost Testbed for Network-based Research This work involves development of high-performance commodity computing from commodity hardware, which opens up possibilities of much wider access to high-performance computing. The premise is that efficient use of network, storage and computation resources, and the specification and provision of well defined qualities of service, are the critical core technologies. Further, these technologies must keep costs low by not requiring significant modifications in commercial hardware or operating systems, and they must not require a significant increase in system administration overhead, which would be beyond what could be reasonably expected in less technical environments. The research will take place within the new Egan Engineering Research Center at Northeastern University. The investigators on this proposal are from the College of Computer Science, the Center for Digital Processing and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. These units have a history of working collaboratively and of managing shared resources and all have research place in the Egan building in a very close proximity to the location where the proposed network will be place.","title":"MRI: A High-Performance, Low-Cost Testbed for Network-based Research","awardID":"9871022","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"1189","name":"MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["521812","557272","438360","138361"],"PO":["430923"]},"37465":{"abstract":"This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program in optical sciences and engineering that will prepare PhD students for a variety of careers in academic and industrial environments. This activity is a joint effort of twenty-six scientists and engineers from the Departments of Chemistry, Physics, and Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Colorado, and two affiliated institutes, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA). This group of scientists and engineers has established research collaborations and their collective expertise will provide the intellectual underpinning for the training of a diverse cadre of some ninety graduate students over the five-year tenure of the award. Optical science and engineering is particularly well-suited integrative research theme because its diverse components are extremely important in both basic research and industrial applications. The program's research components are clustered in three areas: optical control and manipulation of fundamental systems, optical metrology, and optical processing of information. Within these clusters, PhD training will address the unmet need for advanced degree graduates who possess the `Employable Quintet` of technical knowledge in depth, problem solving ability in a laboratory setting, flexibility in learning and working, the ability to work in teams, and clarity in oral and written communication. Ten percent of the IGERT traineeship positions will support students in an experimental Professional Masters Degree program that will include all aspects of the doctoral program except the dissertation project. IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program intended to facilitate the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of scientists and engineers to be well-prepared to take advantage of a broad spectrum of career options. IGERT provides doctoral institutions with an opportunity to develop new, well-focussed multidisciplinary graduate programs that transcend organizational boundaries and unite faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly interactive, collaborative environment for both training and research. In this first year of the program, support will be provided to seventeen institutions for new or nascent programs that collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF.","title":"IGERT: Graduate Training in Optical Science and Engineering","awardID":"9870665","effectiveDate":"1998-09-15","expirationDate":"2005-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0309","name":"Division of CHEMISTRY","abbr":"CHE"},"pgm":{"id":"1253","name":"OFFICE OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY AC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0705","name":"Division of ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND CENT","abbr":"EEC"},"pgm":{"id":"1360","name":"HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1101","name":"Division of GRADUATE EDUCATION","abbr":"DGE"},"pgm":{"id":"1335","name":"IGERT FULL PROPOSALS"}}],"PIcoPI":["419883","321867","295807"],"PO":["197030"]},"37597":{"abstract":"EIA-9871133 Seidel, Steven R.

A better method from a software engineering viewpoint is to explicitly define the collaboration semantics and implement them as a detached module in the system.

The advantages of this approach include ease of reading and understanding the rules, formal notation for analysis of errors, ease of developing collaborative systems with modular components, and dynamic adaptation of rules as collaboration progresses. Through this research we will investigate such modular collaboration protocols, building and evaluating several complex collaborative systems that use them: a group Web browser (CobWeb) that allows many different protocols; multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs); and an implementation of a game called Nomic, in which the only possible move (initially, at least) is to propose and vote on rule changes. This research will have increasing significance as collaborative applications become more common; its impact will be to allow construction of collaborative software systems that are more reliable (provably correct), cheaper to build, and cheaper to maintain.

Unfortunately, Internet information sources vary widely in the types of information and access interfaces they provide. Furthermore, the number of available sources is overwhelming to users. Therefore, using this wealth of resources effectively presents challenging problems. To address these problems, the research goals of the project include: (1) smart query processing over HTML documents, using information like query logs, citations, and user feedback to find the most useful documents for a query; (2) extraction of succinct summaries of information sources with varying capabilities and interfaces, so that the evaluation of user queries can focus on only the most useful information sources; (3) integration of query results from multiple heterogeneous information sources, so that users can query multiple sources and still receive a single, coherent query result; (4) integration of text, relational, and image repositories, so that users can use all available information regardless of its format. The educational objectives include the expansion of the curriculum in databases and information systems at Columbia University. In particular, a new course covers the latest trends in database and information systems. In summary, this project will develop the tools to provide users with seamless and transparent access to the large number and variety of Internet sources.

These new systems, so-called third-generation wireless systems, will incorporate considerable signal-processiilg intelligence in order to provide advanced services such as multimedia. In order to make optimal use of available bandwidth for these services and to provide maximal flexibility, many such systems will operate as multiple-access systems, in which channel bandwidth is shared my many users on a random-access basis using protocols such as code division multipleaccess (CDMIA) signaling. Moreover, in order to support the high data rates inherent in such services, ratios of bit rates to bandwidths will be pushed to their limits. In general, wireless channels can be be very hostile media through which to communicate. Physical impairments such as multiple-access interference, co-channel interference, multipath transmission, amplitude fading, and dispersion due to limited bandwidth, all contribute to make it difficult to transmit data reliably and quickly through wireless channels. Moreover, the dynamism resulting from user mobility and the above-noted random-access nature of mobile channels, amplify the effects of these impairments, and make them much more difficult to ameliorate. Solutions to these difficulties lie in the use of<br\/>advanced adaptive systems to perform advanced signal processing functions, and this proposal addresses such solutions.<br\/><br\/>Specifically, we plan to consider three general research problems within the area of adaptive equalization of multiple-access wireless channels: optimal methods for joint adaptive equalization and multiuser detection; adaptive linear and nonlinear methods for joint adaptive equalization and multiuser detection; and iterative methods for joint adaptive equalization and multiuser detection on coded channels. By addressing these research issues we can answer key questions about the equalization of wireless multiple-access channels. In particular, the consideration of optimal methods will establish baseline results by which other methods can be benchmarked. Furthermore, by considering low complexity adaptive linear and nonlinear methods, we can develop an understanding of mechanisms by which adaptivity can brought to bear on the problem at hand, and moreoever we. can examine the dynamics of adaptation in a tractable setting. And, finally, by consideration of iterative, and other adaptive nonlinear methods, we can seek adaptive techniques that can approach the ideals - of high performance and low complexity - established via the analytical results of the two other areas. <br\/><br\/>In order to accomplish these goals, it is necessary to take a novel approach to these problems, and in particular to synthesize technologies from disparate areas. Consequently, this studv will be conducted as a joint project among three institutions - ALGOREX, Inc., Cornell University, and Princeton University - bringing together considerable separate expertise in the fields of equalization, interference suppression, and adaptive system design to facilitate the necessary synthesis of ideas. <br\/>***","title":"Adaptive Systems for Equalization of Wireless Multiple Access Communication Channel","awardID":"9811297","effectiveDate":"1998-09-15","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0504","name":"Division of MICROELECTRONIC INFOR PROCESS","abbr":"MIP"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0701","name":"Division of ELECTRICAL, COMMUN & CYBER SYS","abbr":"ECCS"},"pgm":{"id":"1504","name":"GRANT OPP FOR ACAD LIA W\/INDUS"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0701","name":"Division of ELECTRICAL, COMMUN & CYBER SYS","abbr":"ECCS"},"pgm":{"id":"1518","name":"CONTROL, NETWORKS, & COMP INTE"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0701","name":"Division of ELECTRICAL, COMMUN & CYBER SYS","abbr":"ECCS"},"pgm":{"id":"1519","name":"INTEGRATIVE SYSTEMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0701","name":"Division of ELECTRICAL, COMMUN & CYBER SYS","abbr":"ECCS"},"pgm":{"id":"4096","name":"COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["466890"],"PO":["564728"]},"26675":{"abstract":"This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's \"Connections to the Internet\" announcement, NSF 96-64.

An important component that has been missing from image synthesis is the effect of weathering. Existing models of materials in computer graphics assume that the materials are in pristine condition, which is rarely the case. This research program focuses on the development of computer graphics models for materials, which will be suitable for the requirements of image synthesis. The research will address three critical aspects of this problem: (1) Taxonomy of materials --a study of a variety of materials will be conducted in order to devise a classification of materials that is specific to computer graphics. (2) Models for materials -- new material models will be developed, which will be capable of sustaining a range of appearances. (3) Assemblies of objects and materials -- data structures will be devised to handle intricate assemblies of complex geometries and materials. The postdoctoral associate will play a key role in the formative stages of the development of the new computer graphics research group at MIT. The associate will bring expertise in modeling and texturing, will collaborate with faculty on research projects, and will provide leadership for student research.","title":"Postdoc: Material Models for Computer Graphics","awardID":"9806139","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["548698"],"PO":["297837"]},"31251":{"abstract":"In this proposal the principal investigators (PIs) study intercellular coordination schemes for the efficient utilization of the wireless network capacity incorporating QoS constraints. The framework that the PIs assume throughout is a cellular mobile system in which each cell contains a base station that communicates with mobile users in that cell. This communication is done over a given set of channels, where a channel is defined to be a generic network resource (e.g., time-slots, frequency bands, etc.). The PIs then propose to develop intercellular coordination schemes for managing channels in two categories:<br\/><br\/>Inter-cellular coordination for Incomplete Reuse: The PIs will study dynamic channel allocation schemes that involve localized coordination between neighboring cells. Specifically, they will investigate a novel scheme called channel sharing, where mobile users have access to channels that are preassigned to groups of cells called meta-cells. This scheme relies only on localized information and hence has significant practical value. The PIs describe their proposed sharing scheme in some detail, and show preliminary results which indicate that the scheme has the potential for significantly improving network performance, and can be used to help reduce QoS violations of existing users in the network.<br\/><br\/>Inter-cellular coordination for complete reuse: Since the problem of globally scheduling all transmission requests with complete success in a cellular system is in general intractable, the PIs propose to tackle the problem by developing a simple intercellular coordination technique. In this technique, they propose to make a priori coordination arrangements between cells, so that a certain set of carrier frequencies in each cell are assigned to communicate at full power, while others communicate at a predetermined reduced power level. The PIs call this scheme a primary-secondary coordination scheme. For this scheme, they have shown preliminary work that the optimal scheduling solution based on user location, is in the form of a simple bang-bang control, which makes the scheme practically appealing. They propose to study joint optimization problems that maximize the network throughput under both location and QoS based constraints. Finally, the PIs propose to investigate the possibility of combining the ideas of sharing and primary-secondary coordination, to increase further the network utilization.<br\/><br\/>This award includes a subcontract to Mischa Schwartz, Columbia University.","title":"Intercellular Coordination Schemes for Multimedia Wireless Networks","awardID":"9805441","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["548182"],"PO":["234222"]},"33693":{"abstract":"This project studies human interaction with virtual human characters, forming a virtual social group.

The research uses simplified social situations derived from a survival world where a social group of people survive by maintaining their social organization, by explicit social interaction, and by cooperatively building dwellings, exploring to find wood and fruits, and by hunting animals. The results will provide answers to questions such as whether a group experience occurs, whether a believable virtual social group can be created, and which social interactions lead to believability of characters. Potential commercial applications include the implementation of a usable virtual social group, from which may be developed animations for movies, interactive games, educational settings and business information settings.

Such a robotic telepresence need not have an anthropomorphic form, but it may need a reasonable set of capabilities for interaction. Consequently, this project will seek to better understand the social and psychological aspects of extended human-human interaction. PRoPs are an excellent platform for studying computer- and robot-mediated human interaction because they operate in physical and social spaces, and can interact with a group of people.

The time-variant buffer delays in particular play a crucial role in the dynamic behavior of high-speed networks. The ensuing nonlinear time-variant model however is extremely difficult to analyze. All existing work therefore rely on simplified linear piecewise time-invariant models. At simulation stage, network flow controller designs based on such models may appear satisfactory; however, when applied to a high-speed system, the true network often exhibits undesirable behavior in contrast to what is predicted.<br\/><br\/>In this proposal, a more realistic model for high-speed networks that includes time-variant delays and nonlinearities will be developed. A distributed sensor network (DSN) that operates in a highly dynamic environment is a particularly demanding application where the network time-variance cannot be ignored. Indeed, treating such a network by conventional piecewise time-invariant methods can lead to unacceptable oscillatory behavior.<br\/><br\/>Communication and processing of signals from a DSN that utilizes a variety of sensors which may be distributed logically, spatially, and geographically, is an essential problem encountered in several areas, such as, robotics, automation, aerospace, medical imaging, etc. In such a DSN, decisions are made at each node in a particular hierarchical level by fusing data communicated from the lower levels. In a highly dynamic environment where the observed scene can change frequently and dramatically, it is essential that importance measures or weights are attached to nodes in the network. This allows allocation of `importance proportional rates' to each node. Such a paradigm, when implemented via an ATM network with the available bit-rate (ABR) option, is shown to allow effective utilization of bandwidth, possibility of capturing transient network dynamics with minimal data loss, and adaptability to fast changes and faults. To accommodate `bursty' traffic, buffer set points are allowed to be varied according to importance of corresponding nodes. Furthermore, network configuration guidelines that allow maximum utilization of the proposed variable bit-rate scheme are provided.<br\/><br\/>To ensure fault tolerance, each node is provided with a local controller whose parameters are chosen to guarantee the node rate to conform to the allocated weight within a specified settling time. The fundamental requirement of stability of such a time-variant network is achieved via recent results on robust stability. The same methods will be used to provide bounds on maximum delays involved and buffer lengths. This allows effective utilization of the proposed strategy of variable buffer set points. For the assignment of importance measures and weights to each node, Dempster-Shafer evidential reasoning techniques are invoked.","title":"Variable Bit-Rate Control of Distributed Sensor Networks","awardID":"9726253","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["560250","82699"],"PO":["155235"]},"37775":{"abstract":"This research is in extending the Graphplan algorithm, which uses disjunctive representation and local constraint satisfaction techniques to handle a wider variety of planning, rather than being restricted to the<br\/>classical planning assumptions of determinism and complete information.

While these capabilities are indeed revolutionary as compared to the current Internet, serious impediments remain to achieving the vision of a ubiquitous multi-service Internet. In particular, efficient resource management algorithms must be available that actually deliver these services to the applications. Packet scheduling algorithms must be devised that can meet the service requirements of heterogeneous applications and different agencies while, at the same time, exploiting statistical multiplexing; admission control algorithms must be designed to allocate the minimum amount of network resources without violating any of the service requirements. At present, no set of resource management algorithms is available that can provide multi-service capabilities while considering the complex dynamics among connections, services, and agencies. This project will provide the first truly integrated resource management infrastructure for multi-service networks. Taking a new and comprehensive approach at resource management algorithms within the framework of the integrated services Internet, we propose to develop: (1) A novel hierarchical link sharing service model and algorithm that simultaneously supports all of the services proposed by the IETF without sacrificing efficient utilization of network resources, (2) Traffic control and scheduling algorithms that are amenable to efficient implementation in high speed and scalable switching systems, (3) Admission control algorithms for an enforceable controlled-load service with statistical quality of service guarantees, (4) Robust admission control algorithms for measurement-based controlled-load services, and (5) Traffic control algorithms that provide graceful quality-of-service adaptation in the presence of transient fluctuations of the network load. This project will develop the theoretical underpinnings of integrated resource management algorithms for multi-service networks. Moreover, in a collaboration that involves an integrated services network provider (MCI Telecommunications), a network equipment vendor (Ascend), and academic researchers (CMU, Rice, Polytechnic), the PIs will build a complete prototype implementation of the proposed algorithms on the vBNS national network infrastructure. This reference implementation will provide a first-of-its-kind platform for experimental research on the integrated services Internet that will yield critical input to both practitioners in the field and standards bodies on the effectiveness of current and newly proposed resource management algorithms.","title":"Integrated Resource Management for the Integrated Services Internet","awardID":"9730104","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["548310"],"PO":["155235"]},"27523":{"abstract":"A datacube is a multidimensional structure that contains at each point an aggregate value, i.e., the result of applying an aggregate function to an dataset of records.

Understanding these tradeoffs makes it possible to efficiently design and implement multiresolution systems where query answers can be incrementally refined as the user looks at them.

While these capabilities are indeed revolutionary as compared to the current Internet, serious impediments remain to achieving the vision of a ubiquitous multi-service Internet. In particular, efficient resource management algorithms must be available that actually deliver these services to the applications. Packet scheduling algorithms must be devised that can meet the service requirements of heterogeneous applications and different agencies while, at the same time, exploiting statistical multiplexing; admission control algorithms must be designed to allocate the minimum amount of network resources without violating any of the service requirements. At present, no set of resource management algorithms is available that can provide multi-service capabilities while considering the complex dynamics among connections, services, and agencies. This project will provide the first truly integrated resource management infrastructure for multi-service networks. Taking a new and comprehensive approach at resource management algorithms within the framework of the integrated services Internet, we propose to develop: (1) A novel hierarchical link sharing service model and algorithm that simultaneously supports all of the services proposed by the IETF without sacrificing efficient utilization of network resources, (2) Traffic control and scheduling algorithms that are amenable to efficient implementation in high speed and scalable switching systems, (3) Admission control algorithms for an enforceable controlled-load service with statistical quality of service guarantees, (4) Robust admission control algorithms for measurement-based controlled-load services, and (5) Traffic control algorithms that provide graceful quality-of-service adaptation in the presence of transient fluctuations of the network load. This project will develop the theoretical underpinnings of integrated resource management algorithms for multi-service networks. Moreover, in a collaboration that involves an integrated services network provider (MCI Telecommunications), a network equipment vendor (Ascend), and academic researchers (CMU, Rice, Polytechnic), the PIs will build a complete prototype implementation of the proposed algorithms on the vBNS national network infrastructure. This reference implementation will provide a first-of-its-kind platform for experimental research on the integrated services Internet that will yield critical input to both practitioners in the field and standards bodies on the effectiveness of current and newly proposed resource management algorithms.","title":"Integrated Resource Management for the Integrated Services Internet","awardID":"9730105","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["435983",67769,67770],"PO":["155235"]},"34168":{"abstract":"A projected shortage of information technology workers may impede the successful integration of new information technologies as the captial investment in information technology proceeds at its current growing rates.

New techniques for evaluating and optimizing general decision-support queries are being developed in the context of a main-memory database. It is becoming possible to store gigabytes of data in RAM. Thus one begins to ask whether decision support query processing could obtain the performance benefits of having data reside in main memory. The approach taken is to study the performance issues associated with processing complex queries in main memory. By designing and using algorithms, access structures, and data representations tailored to main-memory databases, we can avoid much of the overhead that is apparent in a disk-based system even when the data set fits in main-memory. By allowing updates only in an off-line batch window, one gains the flexibility to organize the data in a way that is tuned for fast query response.

The basic shortcoming of the traditional HLR\/VLR based mobility management schemes stems from two problems: nodes that serve as HLRs may be frequently unreachable (due to the intermittent wireless connectivity in such networks) and the association of a mobile with a particular HLR requires dissemination of this information to all the network nodes, presence of which in the network may frequently change. In the proposed scheme, a subset of nodes in the network dynamically assumes the function of the \"Mobility Reporting Centers\" (MRCs). The \"location\" of a mobile is reported to a set (quorum) of the MRCs. To locate a mobile, a set (quorum), possibly different from the reported-to one, is queried. As any two quorums intersect, the querying operation is ensured to produce the location of the mobile. As the quorums may overlap in multiple MRCs, loss of connectivity with a limited number of MRCs may have no effect on the ability of the scheme to locate a mobile. Finally, due to the \"network-wide known\" scheme for quorum creation, there is no need to disseminate the information of association of a mobile with a particular MRC - any reported-to and queried-from two quorums will produce the sought answer. In the proposed one-year feasibility study, we will tackle the following topics: (i) study of the complexity and associated overhead of the quorum-based mobility management scheme' (ii) quorum construction strategies that ensure high degree of reliability with limited network load and uniform MRCs' processing load; (iii) reduction of the probability of erroneous operations and\/or inconsistent querying results during the reconfiguration periods;","title":"A Quorum-Based Management Scheme for Ad-Hoc Networking","awardID":"9805094","effectiveDate":"1998-09-15","expirationDate":"1999-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["438934"],"PO":["150490"]},"30175":{"abstract":"*** 9802191 Hollis This project builds on results from previous NSF grant IRI9420869: \"Magnetic Levitation Haptic Interfaces.\" The previous grant developed a haptic interface (force\/torque feedback) interaction capability for computer users based on Lorentz magnetic levitation.

Specific activities include: (1) development of a composition methodology for control-dominated systems, (2) communication and synchronization code synthesis including buffering and protocol specialization, and (3) debugging, verification, and visualization tools for embedded system design.","title":"Abstraction, Reuse, and Retargetability in Embedded System Design","awardID":"9812131","effectiveDate":"1998-09-15","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2876","name":"DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4710","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4715","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["483628"],"PO":["562984"]},"31176":{"abstract":"Future high-speed computer networks are projected to carry a dizzying array of networked multimedia applications including digital libraries, video and image servers, distance learning and collaboration, networked virtual environments, and entertainment. A common thread among these applications is the so-called \"continuous\" nature of their data. In continuous media (CM) data, strict timing relationships exist, which define the schedule by which CM data must be rendered (e.g., a video displayed or audio played out). In a network setting, the playout timing constraints, the rate variability of specific CM such as variable bit rate (VBR) video, the possibility of packet loss and delay within the network, and the desire to use network resources efficiently together combine to make the transport of CM data an exceptionally challenging problem.<br\/><br\/>An important class of continuous media is stored continuous media. This differs from live continuous media in several ways. First, CM traffic characteristics are typically known ahead of time. Second, CM data is often characterized by a more relaxed requirement as to when playout can begin. Last, unlike live CM data, stored CM data does not provide the opportunity for changing the encoding rate in response to network congestion. In this proposal principal investigators (PIs) outline research aimed at the design and evaluation of algorithms and network transport protocols for supporting stored continuous media applications. These algorithms and protocols accommodate and exploit the unique features of stored CM (e.g., known traffic characteristics and the ability to transmit data further in advance of its playout time, the time-sensitive nature of CM playout).<br\/><br\/>The proposed research divides broadly into two areas:<br\/><br\/>1) Smoothing of stored continuous media. The PIs propose to develop and evaluate work-ahead smoothing algorithms for transmitting stored video to a client subject to client and network buffering constraints. The goal is to develop algorithms that compute CM transmission schedules that require a minimal use of network resources (e.g., have the smallest peak rate requirement, the smallest bandwidth requirement variability, and the smallest buffering requirements).<br\/><br\/> 2) Congestion control for stored continuous media. The PIs propose to develop and evaluate rate control algorithms that adaptively vary the transmission rate of a stored CM source in response to congestion within the network. Of particular interest are the resulting performance tradeoffs among interfering CM and non-CM connections.<br\/><br\/>The proposed research has a particular emphasis on performance -- evaluating and understanding performance in a wide variety of settings, as well as formally establishing properties (e.g., optimality) of specific approaches. Other important themes in the proposed work include the importance of supporting client interactivity (e.g., developing approaches with small startup delays, examining the tradeoff between startup delay and resource requirements), the development of stored CM algorithms and protocols for a variety network settings (e.g., different network service models, as well as in unicast and multicast scenarios), and the complementary mix of theory and experimentation embodied in the proposed research.","title":"Smoothing and Congestion Control Algorithms for Stored Continuous Media","awardID":"9805185","effectiveDate":"1998-09-15","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["499259","545655"],"PO":["234222"]},"35554":{"abstract":"","title":"Graduate Research Fellowship Program","awardID":"9818111","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2004-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1101","name":"Division of GRADUATE EDUCATION","abbr":"DGE"},"pgm":{"id":"7172","name":"GRADUATE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS"}}],"PIcoPI":["398928"],"PO":["279227"]},"33134":{"abstract":"This research is carried out in collaboration with David Maier of the Oregon Graduate Institute. One of the key factors for object-oriented database (OODB) systems to successfully compete with relational systems as well as to meet the performance requirements of many non-traditional applications is the development of an effective query optimizer. This research addresses efficient query optimization for OODB languages. The research framework is based on a calculus, called the monoid comprehension calculus, which has already been shown to capture most features of modern OODB query languages. This effective, yet simple approach transforms the queries into an intermediate form, based on this calculus, that can be efficiently optimized. This research concentrates on two very important optimization problems and proposes practical, effective, and general solutions. The first problem is query unnesting, an optimization that, even though improves performance considerably, is not treated properly by most OODB systems. A framework is developed that generalizes many unnesting techniques proposed recently in the literature and is capable of removing any form of query nesting using a simple and efficient algorithm. The second problem is query optimization in the presence of side effects, i.e., queries that may contain object updates at any place and in any form. A practical method is developed that allows the same optimization techniques proposed for regular queries to be used with minimal changes for OODB queries with side effects. A prototype query optimizer is constructed to demonstrate that these optimization techniques considerably improve performance for queries as well as updates. The results of this research will help OODB vendors build better query optimizers, leading to better system performance. <br\/><br\/>http:\/\/www-cse.uta.edu\/~fegaras\/opt\/","title":"Query Optimization Techniques for OODB Languages","awardID":"9811525","effectiveDate":"1998-09-15","expirationDate":"2001-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}}],"PIcoPI":["553595"],"PO":["563751"]},"27810":{"abstract":"This project involves the development of interactive visualization and data management techniques for the exploration of very large multivariate data sets.

The program is a joint effort of 13 faculty from the Departments of Applied Mathematics, Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences, and Computer Science. In combination with institutional resources, NSF funds will provide stipends for 12 graduate students, 2 postdoctoral students and 9 undergraduate students each year, as well as for related costs of student research training. Graduate students will be required to satisfy existing coursework requirements of their home departments and to take at least three new IGERT advanced topics courses meant to span the three participating disciplines. During the first two years of graduate school, each student will complete an interdisciplinary research project before beginning thesis research. All IGERT graduate trainees and faculty will also participate in a weekly research seminar, biannual retreats, a yearly week-long mini- course lead by a visiting researcher and a national conference to be organized during the second year of the project. Postdoctoral fellows will jointly organize one of the advanced topics courses and will themselves receive additional training to complement that received during their own graduate studies. Undergraduate students will become involved through active involvement in summer research projects in the groups of participating faculty. IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program whose goal is to sponsor the establishment of innovative, researc h-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of new scientists and engineers to be well-prepared for varied careers in the private and public sectors. IGERT provides an opportunity for the development of new, well-focused multidisciplinary programs that bridge traditional organizational barriers, uniting faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly-interactive collaborative environment for both training and research.

She will focus her efforts on three areas of research. One concerns the way computer systems may be shaped by societal and ethical values, building on past research on bias in computer system design. This work will be developed in two directions; one is examining how other values may be embedded in computer system design, values such as autonomy of users. The other is examining the role and responsibilities of scientists and engineers. If it is possible to embed values in systems during design and development stages of a project, then this creates a dilemma. On the one hand we may want to urge scientists and engineers to act in socially responsible ways and make sure they embed the `right` values. On the other hand we may doubt the legitimacy of leaving in the hands of scientists and engineers decisions that might have profound consequences for society. Some may argue that such decisions are more appropriate for representative, democratically, elected bodies. A second area of research is privacy. In the past few years, the number of books and articles about privacy has dramatically increased. The specific problem that the project addresses is what the investigator calls `privacy in public,` which refers to surveillance practices that occur in realms that are not considered to be sensitive or personal. The intellectual puzzle is whether these surveillance practices are properly to be understood as a violation of privacy at all. Because privacy has for so long been associated with the personal, sensitive and intimate zones, some scholars have answered in the negative, despite substantial popular resistance. This project tries to explain why public resistance is closer to the truth than some of these scholarly contributions would suggest. The third area of research is societal and ethical dimensions of educational and research uses of information technology. The project will build upon research already begun, into (1) possible dehumanizing impacts of information technology in schools and acceptable decisionmaking strategies; and (2) how an electronic infrastructure may affect important research norms, practices, and conventions. This POWRE award will make possible a much-needed opportunity for the investigator to step down from her full time administrative duties and dedicate herself to research and teaching. In order to make this transition, and ultimately to be competitive in a tight job market, she will need to intensify the rate at which she conducts research. The award will provide the opportunity for just such a boost.","title":"POWRE: Societal Values in An Age of Information Technology","awardID":"9806234","effectiveDate":"1998-09-15","expirationDate":"2000-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0405","name":"Division of OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE","abbr":"SES"},"pgm":{"id":"1397","name":"CROSS-DIRECTORATE  ACTIV PROGR"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["563668"],"PO":["231322"]},"33432":{"abstract":"9812016<br\/>Gurer, Denise<br\/>Association for Computing Machinery<br\/><br\/>Special Projects: POWRE: Investigating the Incredible Shrinking Pipeline for Women in Computer Science<br\/><br\/>The Association for Computing Machinery Committee on women in computing proposes to conduct a 1-year project to study the shrinking pipeline for women in computer science.

One is the explosion of the multimedia (mainly data) traffic over the Internet, especially the World-Wide-Web, which as many discovered recently, can be bursty at all time scales and various multiplexing levels. The other is the continuing advances of WDM optical networking technologies, which offer many opportunities to streamline both software (protocols) and hardware (electronic equipments) for reduced latency and cost. The objective of this research is to explore a novel switching paradigm for WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexed) optical networks, called Optical Burst Switching (OBS). OBS uses an offset time between a control (or set-up) packet and its corresponding data burst when making one-way delayed reservation, which facilitates all-optical data transfers and distinguishes it from other one-way reservation schemes and label\/tag switching schemes. By combining the best of the coarse-grained optical circuit switching (via wavelength routed lightpaths) and the fine-grained optical packet\/cell switching, while avoiding their shortcomings, OBS can efficiently support applications requiring many short-lived (or bursty) sessions during which a substantial amount of data needs to be transferred at a high bit rate and with a low end-to-end latency. More importantly, it will help realize the vision of building a flexible, efficient and bandwidth-abundant fiber-optic internetworking infrastructure capable of providing ubiquitous services through TCP\/IP (as well as ATM and other existing and future protocols). In this project, we will focus on the design and performance evaluation of efficient OBS protocols that can reduce burst dropping probability, and support flow and congestion control as well as multicasting, priority and fault-tolerant routing. We will also study how upper layer protocols (e.g. IP) interact with OBS, investigate related optical-layer control and managemen t issues such as resource provisioning, protection and restoration, and in addition, compare OBS with other burst switching and lable\/tag switching techniques.

The basic shortcoming of the traditional HLR\/VLR based mobility management schemes stems from two problems: nodes that serve as HLRs may be frequently unreachable (due to the intermittent wireless connectivity in such networks) and the association of a mobile with a particular HLR requires dissemination of this information to all the network nodes, presence of which in the network may frequently change. In the proposed scheme, a subset of nodes in the network dynamically assumes the function of the \"Mobility Reporting Centers\" (MRCs). The \"location\" of a mobile is reported to a set (quorum) of the MRCs. To locate a mobile, a set (quorum), possibly different from the reported-to one, is queried. As any two quorums intersect, the querying operation is ensured to produce the location of the mobile. As the quorums may overlap in multiple MRCs, loss of connectivity with a limited number of MRCs may have no effect on the ability of the scheme to locate a mobile. Finally, due to the \"network-wide known\" scheme for quorum creation, there is no need to disseminate the information of association of a mobile with a particular MRC - any reported-to and queried-from two quorums will produce the sought answer. In the proposed one-year feasibility study, we will tackle the following topics: (i) study of the complexity and associated overhead of the quorum-based mobility management scheme' (ii) quorum construction strategies that ensure high degree of reliability with limited network load and uniform MRCs' processing load; (iii) reduction of the probability of erroneous operations and\/or inconsistent querying results during the reconfiguration periods;","title":"Quorum Based Mobility Management Schemes for Ad-Hoc Networking","awardID":"9805133","effectiveDate":"1998-09-15","expirationDate":"2000-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["462892"],"PO":["150490"]},"33135":{"abstract":"This research is on interconnect design in submicron technologies, with the goal of developing a logic synthesis methodology which would produce highly regular layout structures without large area penalty.

Design teams comprised of engineering students affiliated with a consortium of institutions in Asia, Europe and North America, and engineers working with our industrial partners are provided with collaboration tools. Surveys and thorough interviews with team members before, during and after project work highlight the interactions between distributed group communication and knowledge distribution processes, computer-mediated communication supports, and cultural factors. The results of this research will provide new approaches for using computer-based communication and collaboration tools to help distributed groups overcome problems associated with extreme geographic dispersion and cultural differences.

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) models of digital communication systems arise in a wide variety of communications applications: high-speed digital subscriber lines, multi-track digital magnetic recording, multiuser\/multi-access communications systems, digital radio with diversity, dually polarized radio channels, multisensor sonar\/radar systems, etc. MIMO channel modeling allows for a unified and optimal approach to design of MIMO equalizers\/filters\/combiners for suppression of intersymbol interference (ISI), cochannel and adjacent channel interferences (CCI and ACI) and multi-access interferences (MAI). State-of-the-art in this area requires complete knowledge of the MIMO transfer function which is unrealistic for practical communication systems. In MIMO systems the training sequences must also be provided by the interference-generating sources: an utterly unrealistic assumption. One of the goals of this research program is to provide more practical answers to the above problems of great practical importance by removing the need for training sequences for adaptive multichannel equalizer design. Both second-order statistics-based and higher-order statistics-based approaches are being investigated with emphasis on the former. Emphasis is on approaches that require as few assumptions as possible compared to existing literature, e.g. common zeros among the subchannels are allowed, the channel matrix impulse response can be infinitely long, etc. The results of the proposed research on blind source separation are expected to be useful to scientists and engineers engaged in processing and analysis of multisensor data in a broad class of applications such as sonar, radar, acoustic array ap plications and monitoring of power plants and civil works.

The objective of this project is to achieve significant gains in wireless system performance and spectral efficiency through a tight, synergistic theory-experiment loop. The research objectives of the seven proposed focus areas are summarized below:<br\/><br\/>Wireless Testbed: An existing and functioning wireless testbed will be leveraged to build an experimental system which forms the bedrock of the proposed research. This flexible design permits operation at multiple frequencies, with multiple bandwidth and array capabilities.<br\/><br\/>Multiple Access Signaling: Advanced multi-user receivers will be designed by considering novel characterizations of multiple access interference, inherent parameter mismatch, and systems that offer multiple data rates. Coupled model order selection\/parameter estimation techniques will be employed to optimally characterizecand mitigate interference.<br\/><br\/>Space-Time Modems: Traditional models for space-time characteristics will be validated via field tests. Experimentally refined models will be used to optimize space-time codes. Both coupled and decoupled space-time processing algorithms will be developed to perform multi-user separation and channel equalization for multiple data rate systems.<br\/><br\/>Error Control: An interactive\/iterative design process between physical layer system design and network layer protocol design will be employed to efficiently distribute system complexity. To this end, experimental error statistics will be characterized and error statistic shaping methods will be developed. For given error statistics, optimal protocols will be designed and analyzed.<br\/><br\/>Access Methods: Based on the error characteristics drawn from experimental data, we will design medium access control protocols to support timely establishment of message streams and to support different levels of temporal QoS in the presence of channel errors and fading.<br\/><br\/>Mobility: The testbed will be used to study how the channel error and fading characteristics of wireless links impact the design of a robust handoff mechanism and how error characteristics can be shaped and tuned to facilitate the design.<br\/><br\/>Flow Control: Flow control is an important resource management problem for reliable data transmission, especially in a high demand situation. A stable, robust, adaptive controller design scheme will be developed for a class of time-varying, time-delay system models appearing in basic flow control problems of communication networks.<br\/><br\/>This research project addresses several of the priorities established by the NSF for sponsored research programs. The project has been designed to be collaborative and interdisciplinary and each problem has been specifically chosen to take advantage of existing and proven expertise of the OSU team. Additionally, successful achievement of the research objectives necessitates the merging of theoretical and experimental activity. The project leverages existing facilities, but will also improve the infrastructure for future research and educational endeavors.

The topics explored include security for user-defined Java extensions, resource management (using the techniques developed in the Cornell J-Kernel project), scalability for highly concurrent workloads, and optimization of queries with Java extensions in a client-server environment. The results from this stage of the project provide a comprehensive understanding of how to efficiently support Java extensions in a database system. Can Java be used for traditional database server functionality? The next stage of the project addresses this question. The goal is to run queries partially at the server and partially at the client, thereby optimizing execution across slow networks. Java is an ideal choice to represent portable algorithms, and the project studies different server designs for portable query processing. However, the use of Java could reduce the overall server performance. An important result of this project is a qualitative and quantitative study of the tradeoffs between the different design choices.

The goal of this research is to develop scalable robust techniques to model noisy data sets containing an unknown number of overlapping categories, and apply them to create a software tool for web personalization and mining. Personalization has two components: (1) tailoring the content delivered to the user from a web site; and (2) exploring the available web pages and categorizing them. The approach consists of developing new practical clustering algorithms by combining fuzzy methods, robust statistics, with Monte Carlo\/bootstrapping techniques to model an unknown number of overlapping sets in the presence outliers. Since many web objects such as URLs, IP addresses, and web pages cannot be represented by numerical features, new techniques to handle web objects with linguistic and textual features, as well as to categorize or cluster them by using suitable similarity measures between such objects, are being explored. A software tool for web personalization and mining, which incorporates the algorithms developed into a software architecture, is being created and validated. The results of this project will generate new theoretical results and efficient algorithms for simultaneously estimating the parameters of an unknown number of overlapping categories from noisy data sets, as well as a web personalization and mining tool that will be made available on the web. Thus, this project is expected to have a significant impact on the way documents are searched for and delivered.

This research also addresses developing a method for mapping a target system to an analytic performance model used to predict the performance of the target systems under various workload intensity situations. By characterizing the performance of components and their interactions, the overall performance of the target system can be estimated.

Unfortunately, these features are challenging to implement efficiently in a compiler. The central difficulty is that the compiler must decide what concrete representations to assign to different abstractions of the same type in different contexts. Traditional compilers (inefficiently) solve this problem by choosing a uniform representation for all data. This research, part of the Church Project (http:\/\/www.cs.bu.edu\/groups\/church) addresses this challenge by (1) embedding type and control\/data flow information in the intermediate representation of the program, (2) maintaining the accuracy of this information through the stages of the compiler and (3) using this information to customize data representations based on context, and to drive several compiler optimizations. The goal is to experimentally evaluate the efficacy of these \"flow types\" to compile a modern language like ML. Products of this research will include a compiler workbench that can be tuned with respect to flow information, experimental results indicating the effectiveness of type and flow information in compilation, and the design, implementation and evaluation of a new framework for the compilation of program fragments.","title":"Experimental Software Systems: Collaborative Research: Applications of Flow Types in the Efficient, Modular, and Reliable Compilation of Higher-Order Typed Languages","awardID":"9806747","effectiveDate":"1998-09-15","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"4725","name":"EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS\/CADRE"}}],"PIcoPI":["520288"],"PO":["179487"]},"33841":{"abstract":"9813290 Harrold, Mary J.

Regression testing, which is an expensive but necessary part of software maintenance, is used to provide confidence that a modification to a program is correct. One negative consequence of the expense of regression testing is that maintainers sometimes do not perform the tests, with disastrous results, because they \"know\" that a change is correct. The initial focus of this research is a series of experiments with a new technique for reducing the cost (and thereby increasing the use) of regression testing. The technique, which uses a combination of program slices to extract semantically meaningful parts of a program, produces a program called \"differences\" that captures the semantic change between a previously tested program and a changed version of this program; it should be more efficient to test \"differences\", because it omits unchanged computations. One goal of this research, which will use C programs, is to assist in the technology transfer of a technique with a rather theoretical basis to industry.

As large-scale information-sharing technologies become more widespread, it is critical to understand the contextual elements that make them succeed and fail.

Difficulties are experienced even by organizations that are willing to share their GIS products. The primary objective of this research, a collaborative project with IIS-9812520, is to formally identify and verify factors and processes influencing governmental agencies' sharing of geographic information across boundaries. The project focuses particularly on behavioral and organizational factors that can facilitate or inhibit the free flow of geographic information. A large-scale mail survey of key respondents and decision-makers in selected local, state, and federal agencies will be used to study the key information -sharing decision criteria and coordination factors, and which information sharing configurations yield greater benefits. This work is a substantial step toward a realistic and useful model of the information sharing process for agencies that would benefit from free information exchange but to date have been loathe to make their information available to other parties.

This is a minimalist approach to robotic manipulation--it seeks the simplest manipulators, in terms of the number of actuators, capable of controlling the motion of all part freedoms. Such manipulators will be cheap, lightweight, and modular. Because the manipulator has fewer freedoms than the part, the extra part freedoms are described by motion relative to the manipulator--slipping, rolling, and free flight. Unlike pick-and-place, the part is not firmly grasped by the manipulator. The purpose of dynamic underactuated manipulation is to exploit impact, slipping, rolling, and free flight dynamics to achieve effective control of the motion of the part, replacing some mechanical complexity of a robot system with intelligent motion planning and control. This research explores controllability, motion planning, and feedback control of dynamic underactuated manipulation, and applications including parts feeding and manipulation in space.","title":"Design and Control of Minimalist Robots Using Dynamic Underactuated Manipulation","awardID":"9811571","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["522422"],"PO":["234178"]},"27836":{"abstract":"9732978 Jacko This research seeks solutions to the technical challenges of designing computer interfaces for user populations possessing diverse visual capabilities.

The two requirements of speed and accuracy have often been regarded as competitive and, for this reason, the design of fast and numerically reliable algorithms for large-scale structured linear matrix equations has remained a significant open issue in many instances. Structured matrix equations arise in several applications in the disciplines of filtering, estimation, and control. In this way, the results of the proposed work will further play a concrete role in addressing some of the annoying discrepancies that have always existed in these areas between the theoretical findings and the practical results. These discrepancies are often due to the pitfalls of finite-precision implementations, especially in systems that involve interconnections of digital and analog components, and studies to resolve or ameliorate many of these difficulties have long been overdue. This investigation will address the challenge of combining numerical accuracy and structure exploiting techniques into a unifying framework. The project will build on the work recently done, will extend the results and the framework to a wider class of structured matrix problems, and will explore applications in filtering, estimation and control.","title":"Fast Reliable Algorithms for Structured Computations","awardID":"9732376","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":["448637"],"PO":["179846"]},"27759":{"abstract":"This project investigates three distinct areas.

Unfortunately, these features are challenging to implement efficiently in a compiler. The central difficulty is that the compiler must decide what concrete representations to assign to different abstractions of the same type in different contexts. Traditional compilers (inefficiently) solve this problem by choosing a uniform representation for all data. This research, part of the Church Project (http:\/\/www.cs.bu.edu\/groups\/church) addresses this challenge by (1) embedding type and control\/data flow information in the intermediate representation of the program, (2) maintaining the accuracy of this information through the stages of the compiler and (3) using this information to customize data representations based on context, and to drive several compiler optimizations. The goal is to experimentally evaluate the efficacy of these \"flow types\" to compile a modern language like ML. Products of this research will include a compiler workbench that can be tuned with respect to flow information, experimental results indicating the effectiveness of type and flow information in compilation, and the design, implementation and evaluation of a new framework for the compilation of program fragments.","title":"Experimental Software Systems: Collaborative Research: Applications of Flow Type in the Efficient, Modular and Reliable Compilation of Higher-Order Typed Languages","awardID":"9806835","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"4725","name":"EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS\/CADRE"}}],"PIcoPI":["564588"],"PO":["179487"]},"32874":{"abstract":"9810673<br\/>Eschen, Elaine M.<br\/>Fielder, Vivian J.<br\/>Fisk University<br\/><br\/>CISE Minority Institutions Infrastructure Program: Computer Science at Fisk: Expanding the Minoriy Pipeline<br\/><br\/>This special project, funded by a combination of seven programs from two directorates (CISE and EHR) and various divisions (C-CR, DUE, EIA, IIS), includes the development and evaluation of a new course, \"Exploring Computer Science,\" and use of CSAB criteria to provide guidance for general upgrade of the curriculum.

The primary objective of the LMC (Logic-Based Model Checking) project is to build succinct and efficient model checkers based on the latest advances in concurrency research and tabled logic programming. Initial results include a model checker for value-passing CCS (a language for specifying concurrent systems) and the modal mu-calculus (an expressive temporal logic), written in less than 200 lines of tabled Prolog code, with performance comparable to that of other contemporary systems. The LMC project has, until now, focused on model checking finite-state systems. The Postdoctoral Candidate supported by the current project will expand the scope of the LMC project by using the power and versatility of constraint tabled logic programming to verify infinite-state systems. For instance, representing sets of states by constraints permits use of case-based reasoning for finitely verifying certain infinite-state systems. Moreover, programming with constraints and tables facilitates tighter integration of deductive strategies, such as induction, with algorithmic model checking. The resulting technology will permit verification of an infinite family of systems (e.g. a protocol with N participants, for any N), without having to verify each instance separately.","title":"CISE PostDoc: Beyond Finite State Model Checking in LMC","awardID":"9805735","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["477226"],"PO":["564318"]},"30135":{"abstract":"This research is concerned with making atomic transactions perform well in the wide-area distributed systems that will be the norm in the future. The work focuses on support for consistency levels that are weaker than serializability; these levels are of interest because many applications do not require full serializability and can achieve better performance by running at weaker levels. Some consistency levels have been defined in the past, but the earlier definitions are inadequate because they either do not rule out undesirable behaviors, or they limit implementation techniques unnecessarily. In particular they do not allow optimistic techniques, which is unfortunate because these are the best for wide area and mobile systems. This research provides definitions of existing levels that are both constrained enough to rule out bad behaviors and permissive enough to allow a wide range of concurrency control mechanisms. In addition the research defines a number of useful new levels. Furthermore, the research develops optimistic implementations of the weak levels, and uses simulation and implementation to investigate the performance advantages that can be achieved by running at weaker levels. The research will lead to precise definitions of new and old weak levels, to a set of new, optimistic implementations of the levels, and to a thorough understanding of the performance benefits that derive from weaker levels. http:\/\/www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu","title":"Understanding Degrees of Isolation","awardID":"9802066","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}}],"PIcoPI":["383836"],"PO":["563751"]},"33413":{"abstract":"The goal of this research project is to make advances in the management of \"semistructured\" data: data that may be irregular or incomplete, or whose structure may change rapidly or unpredictably.

Previous work on a query sampling method for establishing cost models in a static system environment is extended to a dynamic system environment. The methodologies adopted in this project include a qualitative approach, which introduces qualitative variables into cost models, and an adaptive approach, which adaptively incorporates dynamic cost information observed from execution of user queries into cost models. All approaches are evaluated and compared in order to determine the most promising one to establish dynamic cost models for multidatabase systems.

These algorithms and representations segment dramas, comedies, newscasts, sporting events, and talk shows into three levels of structural significance: camera shots; scenes, or sets; and the thematic repetitions of scenes, or acts, thus providing a means to recapture something like the originating ``storyboard'' level of the video's outline. These three levels of semantically coherent units are then displayed in a novel musical score-like graphic format, with user variable precision and detail. This work explores four aspects of analysis: the selection of appropriate low-level image features, the design of representations and relationships of structure at each of the three levels based on tunable human memory models, the exploration of display configurations and video subsequence selection for effective user browsing, and the validation of algorithmic optimizations and user feedback over a large corpus of videos. This work makes explicit some of the structural rules and heuristics that govern the creation of thematically coherent long video sequences.

This framework will reduce the cost and time of real-time software development by providing the infrastructure necessary for building reusable multi-purpose real-time software components. In much the same way as today's consumers can buy software and hardware components from different vendors and construct a computing environment tailored to their needs, this framework can provide the means of building and integrating real-time system components so as to preserve their temporal correctness while making it possible to dynamically compute predictable end-to-end temporal guarantees commensurate with available resources. <br\/><br\/>We plan to demonstrate the benefits of our framework by building a testbed and executing representative applications on the testbed, drawn from both soft real-time systems such as multimedia, and hard real-time systems such as automated flight. Software development costs of these applications are expected to be reduced significantly by separating real-time application design from resource-capacity assumptions on the target platform, hence facilitating changes in platform capacity, configuration or load. This project is also to demonstrate how our abstraction of platform capacity (away from the programmer) can help build real-time systems that can tolerate a range of violations of their load and failure hypotheses by adapting application QoS dynamically to the resources available.","title":"Experimental Software Systems: Adaptware: A Design Framework for Adaptive Real-Time Systems","awardID":"9806280","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"4725","name":"EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS\/CADRE"}}],"PIcoPI":["553551","464147"],"PO":["241298"]},"37813":{"abstract":"This CRCD project supports the incorporation of tools for computer architecture simulation, performance prediction, program optimization and application characterization into computer science and engineering curricula.

Koel, Bruce E. University of Southern California Partnerships in Nanotechnology: Robotic Assembly of Functional Nanostructures Control over the structure of matter at the nanometer scale may revolutionize science and technology, depending on the extent to which nanostructures can be assembled for specific functions. The thrust of this project is the development of a process for producing functional nanostructures. The process is based on manipulation of colloidal nanoparticles with an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) under program control. This process can be used by itself or to complement others, for example to modify a regular array of particles laid down by self-assembly or to construct a template for self-assembly. The primary application motivating this project is fabrication of an information storage device, the nanoCD, in which digital information is encoded in patterns of nanoparticles. However, the resulting processes will be generic and will have a wide range of potential applications. The research will proceed along two directions. The first is the development of manipulation strategies and associated software, using either known robotics techniques or inventing new ones. Nanoassembly must be automated because the number of elementary operations required in most assemblies will be enormous. The second research direction focuses on materials and phenomena at the nanometer scale. Issues to be addressed include the substrates, tips, and nanoparticles to be used, and the physics and chemistry of particles manipulation. Initial efforts are aimed at understanding the mechanics of moving nanoparticles with an AFM tip and the influence of process parameters. Initially, silicon substrates and colloidal nano particles will be investigated, to build upon current knowledge.

Fortunately, a scientist often only needs access to small subsets of the data at its full resolution. The identification of these \"interesting\" subsets is part of the data exploration process. An effective data exploration environment for very large data sets requires a hierarchy of data representations at increasingly finer resolution, along with an accompanying \"error\" measure that helps to identify the authenticity of each representation level. One example of research that could benefit significantly from such a representation is the study of clear air turbulence in the atmosphere. Using techniques of computational fluid dynamics (cfd), direct numerical simulations resolve both the smooth wave motion over most of the domain, and the turbulence, which occurs in small patches. These turbulent patches are important for airplane travel, satellite communications, and environmental studies. Simulations such as require hours of supercomputer time and produce far more output data than can be \"downloaded\" and visualized without time-consuming trial-and-error. This project aims at developing tools to transform such data into a multiresolution hierarchy with error measures and to provide associated interactive access and rendering functionality. Such an environment will provide researchers with interactive access to an order of magnitude more data than is otherwise possible. Such access will allow researchers to interpret their data in far less time than is now possible, and as a result, they will be able to run their simulations at ever more accurate resolutions. <br\/>http:\/\/www.cs.unh.edu\/mdr\/","title":"Multiresolution Data Representation","awardID":"9871859","effectiveDate":"1998-09-15","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}}],"PIcoPI":["548369","358445"],"PO":["563751"]},"37604":{"abstract":"EIA-9871159 Nawab, S.

The potential presence of multiple stages restricts the information available to the middleware component, with particular impact on query optimization. The conventional approach, of cost-based query optimization, in which numerous query plans are enumerated and the cheapest one selected, is not appropriate when detailed cost metrics are not available and when the later stages perform their own, complex optimization. A new approach, termed cost-based graph rewriting, is used to transform a query in one query language into an efficient output query in perhaps a different language. A novel idiomatic cost estimator provides cost parameters to the rewriter, enabling the rewriter to determine the processing that should take place within the component, and the processing that should be performed by later stages. This estimator is more coarse-grained than conventional estimators; in particular, it does not cost individual relational operators in a query plan. The goal of this exploratory research project is to develop an initial prototype utilizing these concepts for a temporal middleware component translating TSQL2 into SQL, and to evaluate the efficacy of this approach by targeting at least two different commercial DBMSs and demonstrating that the middleware component can reflect the differences of these DBMSs in the generated code.","title":"SGER: Staged Query Processing","awardID":"9817798","effectiveDate":"1998-09-15","expirationDate":"1999-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}}],"PIcoPI":["560601"],"PO":["563751"]},"35207":{"abstract":"Failure in requirements analysis is increasingly seen as a key problem in system design.

Environments with broad degrees of freedom for organizational action, especially when systems are intended to change organizational behavior present designers with the need to reduce the search space to viable options. The process for determining high-level requirements through a strategy of search-space definition and reduction is developed using an enhanced version of the Grossman, Hart and Moore property rights model to create an a priori alignment model of task responsibilities and asset ownership in a complex production system dependent on non-integrated coordination mechanisms such as contracts.

However, single- thread performance is still important for mainstream processors. When there are only one or a few processes in the system, hardware can create threads that increase the ILP available to the SMT processor, using otherwise idle resources. This project is developing hardware thread- generation techniques to increase SMT performance in the absence of software-generated thread-level parallelism. The techniques being investigating include multiple path execution, instruction recycling, and speculative loop execution. Threaded Multiple-path Execution (TME) takes advantage of idle hardware contexts to solve the branch problem, speculatively executing multiple paths through conditional branches in a single application. Instruction Recycling increases the efficiency of multiple-path execution, as it avoids refetching instructions which are not path-dependent on a branch, and avoids re-executing instructions that are not data-dependent on the branch. Speculative Loop Parallelism speculatively executes multiple future loop iterations in parallel, using compiler analysis and dynamic hardware detection of loops and induction statements.","title":"Hardware Generation of Threads in a Multithreading Processor","awardID":"9808697","effectiveDate":"1998-09-15","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4715","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["542069","293079"],"PO":["197478"]},"31027":{"abstract":"The primary objectives of the proposed research are: 1) Develop a new controller design methodology based around a combination of robust control and neural network reinforcement learning techniques.

These new systems, so-called third-generation wireless systems, will incorporate considerable signal-processiilg intelligence in order to provide advanced services such as multimedia. In order to make optimal use of available bandwidth for these services and to provide maximal flexibility, many such systems will operate as multiple-access systems, in which channel bandwidth is shared my many users on a random-access basis using protocols such as code division multipleaccess (CDMIA) signaling. Moreover, in order to support the high data rates inherent in such services, ratios of bit rates to bandwidths will be pushed to their limits. In general, wireless channels can be be very hostile media through which to communicate. Physical impairments such as multiple-access interference, co-channel interference, multipath transmission, amplitude fading, and dispersion due to limited bandwidth, all contribute to make it difficult to transmit data reliably and quickly through wireless channels. Moreover, the dynamism resulting from user mobility and the above-noted random-access nature of mobile channels, amplify the effects of these impairments, and make them much more difficult to ameliorate. Solutions to these difficulties lie in the use of<br\/>advanced adaptive systems to perform advanced signal processing functions, and this proposal addresses such solutions.<br\/><br\/>Specifically, we plan to consider three general research problems within the area of adaptive equalization of multiple-access wireless channels: optimal methods for joint adaptive equalization and multiuser detection; adaptive linear and nonlinear methods for joint adaptive equalization and multiuser detection; and iterative methods for joint adaptive equalization and multiuser detection on coded channels. By addressing these research issues we can answer key questions about the equalization of wireless multiple-access channels. In particular, the consideration of optimal methods will establish baseline results by which other methods can be benchmarked. Furthermore, by considering low complexity adaptive linear and nonlinear methods, we can develop an understanding of mechanisms by which adaptivity can brought to bear on the problem at hand, and moreoever we. can examine the dynamics of adaptation in a tractable setting. And, finally, by consideration of iterative, and other adaptive nonlinear methods, we can seek adaptive techniques that can approach the ideals - of high performance and low complexity - established via the analytical results of the two other areas. <br\/><br\/>In order to accomplish these goals, it is necessary to take a novel approach to these problems, and in particular to synthesize technologies from disparate areas.

As large-scale information-sharing technologies become more widespread, it is critical to understand the contextual elements that make them succeed and fail. Geographic information systems are a case in point. A substantial amount of research and experience indicates that, in spite of governmental calls to the contrary, few public agencies and governments are willing to share geographic information across organization boundaries, leading to substantial duplication and inefficiencies. Difficulties are experienced even by organizations that are willing to share their GIS products. The primary objective of this research, a collaborative project with IIS-9812520, is to formally identify and verify factors and processes influencing governmental agencies' sharing of geographic information across boundaries. The project focuses particularly on behavioral and organizational factors that can facilitate or inhibit the free flow of geographic information. A large-scale mail survey of key respondents and decision-makers in selected local, state, and federal agencies will be used to study the key information -sharing decision criteria and coordination factors, and which information sharing configurations yield greater benefits. This work is a substantial step toward a realistic and useful model of the information sharing process for agencies that would benefit from free information exchange but to date have been loathe to make their information available to other parties.

The time-variant buffer delays in particular play a crucial role in the dynamic behavior of high-speed networks. The ensuing nonlinear time-variant model however is extremely difficult to analyze. All existing work therefore rely on simplified linear piecewise time-invariant models. At simulation stage, network flow controller designs based on such models may appear satisfactory; however, when applied to a high-speed system, the true network often exhibits undesirable behavior in contrast to what is predicted.<br\/><br\/>In this proposal, a more realistic model for high-speed networks that includes time-variant delays and nonlinearities will be developed. A distributed sensor network (DSN) that operates in a highly dynamic environment is a particularly demanding application where the network time-variance cannot be ignored. Indeed, treating such a network by conventional piecewise time-invariant methods can lead to unacceptable oscillatory behavior.<br\/><br\/>Communication and processing of signals from a DSN that utilizes a variety of sensors which may be distributed logically, spatially, and geographically, is an essential problem encountered in several areas, such as, robotics, automation, aerospace, medical imaging, etc. In such a DSN, decisions are made at each node in a particular hierarchical level by fusing data communicated from the lower levels. In a highly dynamic environment where the observed scene can change frequently and dramatically, it is essential that importance measures or weights are attached to nodes in the network. This allows allocation of `importance proportional rates' to each node. Such a paradigm, when implemented via an ATM network with the available bit-rate (ABR) option, is shown to allow effective utilization of bandwidth, possibility of capturing transient network dynamics with minimal data loss, and adaptability to fast changes and faults. To accommodate `bursty' traffic, buffer set points are allowed to be varied according to importance of corresponding nodes. Furthermore, network configuration guidelines that allow maximum utilization of the proposed variable bit-rate scheme are provided.<br\/><br\/>To ensure fault tolerance, each node is provided with a local controller whose parameters are chosen to guarantee the node rate to conform to the allocated weight within a specified settling time. The fundamental requirement of stability of such a time-variant network is achieved via recent results on robust stability. The same methods will be used to provide bounds on maximum delays involved and buffer lengths. This allows effective utilization of the proposed strategy of variable buffer set points. For the assignment of importance measures and weights to each node, Dempster-Shafer evidential reasoning techniques are invoked.","title":"Variable Bit Rate Control of Distributed Sensor Networks","awardID":"9726247","effectiveDate":"1998-09-15","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["526929"],"PO":["194325"]},"27607":{"abstract":"The primary goal of this project is to build knowledge about how to maximize the effectiveness of different modes of use of multi-media, anytime\/anyplace group support systems.

Therefore, simple methods can be used to model network traffic in the wavelet domain. In particular, independent wavelet models have shown to be sufficiently accurate, parsimonious, and have the lowest computational complexity attainable. We will focus our efforts on investigating how to use independent wavelet models for analysis including anto-correlation, and buffer loss rate.

Two services which are gaining increasing importance are ABR (Available Bit Rate) and UBR (Undeclared Bit Rate). ABR and UBR are services of lesser quality than CBR (Constant Bit Rate) and VBR (Variable Bit Rate) in that they can use only the residual trunk bandwidth (left over by VBR and CBR). Since bandwidth is not reserved in advance (except for an optional Min Cell Rate, MCR), the network must protect itself from congestion caused by excess ABR and UBR input traffic. In UBR, excess traffic is simply discarded at overloaded nodes. In ABR, the network prevents congestion using a feedback control mechanism. Namely, the input rate of each ABR source is regulated so as to match the available bandwidth on the path. The main focus of this research will be the feedback rate control mechanism, called E-PRCA (Enhanced Proportional Rate Control Algorithm) and its properties and applications.<br\/><br\/>E-PRCA has been implemented in many versions. Most implementations converge to steady state and provide fair bandwidth sharing among competing ABR connections. However, few implementations prevent, or at least bound cell loss. Often, this cell loss problem is overlooked since ABR is \"a best effort service\" and thus the customer was not promised cell loss guarantees. However, a closer look reveals that it is beneficial to limit and if possible prevent ABR cell loss because: (a) Higher layer protocols, such as TCP, are impacted by cell loss; (b) In multicast connections, loss recovery at the application level is costly; and (c) ABR is becoming an attractive alternative (to VBR) for multimedia applications which tolerate adaptive rate regulation.<br\/><br\/>In this project, we propose four tasks:<br\/><br\/>ABR control with cell loss prevention\/bounds: Starting point will be the SP-EPRCA scheme, a rate control scheme based on Smith Predictor and developed by this Investigator and his collaborator. Preliminary properties of cell loss prevention and bounds were already established for SP-EPRCA. We plan to explore the feasibility of cell loss bounds in other popular ABR rate control schemes (e.g., ERICA). We will evaluate the performance of various implementations (via analysis and simulations), deriving tradeoffs between key parameters (buffer allocation, throughput, stability, fairness, responsiveness, etc) for various network and traffic scenarios. Implementation complexity will also be evaluated.<br\/><br\/>ABR multicast : We plan to extend the E-PRCA control to multicast connections. Again, starting point will be an implementation recently proposed for SP-EPRCA. The main focus will be cell loss prevention, which is critical here since data multicast applications are not protected by TCP error and loss recovery.<br\/><br\/>ABR connection routing: We will attack the problem of optimally routing ABR connections subject to rate control with cell loss bound.

The need to extract meaningful information from degraded images is vital in many areas such as aero-optics imaging, surveillance photography, confocal microscopy, and medical imaging. Sources of image degradation vary among application areas, but include atmospheric turbulence, turbidity in a fluid medium, motion blur, and numerous other effects. Image processing tasks such as image enhancement, reconstruction, and restoration are computationally intensive; the underlying physical models require the solution to data-massive and often ill-posed inverse problems where the solution may not depend continuously on the data. All such problems require significant research into the algorithm- architecture-application interaction and can profit substantially from the availability of high-performance software systems. Iterative solvers that exploit both the structure of the problem, and the parallel computing platform, appear to be the most viable candidates for diverse, large scale image enhancement problems. This research project includes the following technical topics: a) New iterative algorithms with effective regularization strategies for blind deconvolution image restoration using adaptive filtering and multichannel phase diversity methods. b) Acceleration of the iterative algorithms utilizing Krylov subspace based multi-level preconditioning. c) New algorithms which partially mitigate the ill-posed nature of the image restoration problem by integrating numerical and symbolic computational methods. d) Development of a high performance software package, entitled \"Parallel Image Processing Environment (pipe})\", which utilizes the image processing algorithms developed in the course of this research.","title":"Algorithms and Software for High-Resolution Imaging","awardID":"9732070","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":[69381,"86249"],"PO":["179846"]},"31744":{"abstract":"9807112<br\/>Lizy K.

This study investigates why contemporary programs (developed in C++, Java, etc.) tend to run slower than traditionally developed (e.g., Fortran and C) programs. For example, when the same application is written in an object-oriented fashion and also constructed in a traditional procedural style, the object-oriented version is known to consume more memory, exhibit worse cache behavior, and to have less predictable branch behavior. This research attempts to isolate these effects and trace them to specific elements of the object oriented programming style. The principal benefit of this study is the collection of knowledge concerning how microprocessors should be designed in the future. Design decisions and engineering tradeoffs in microprocessors are often based on assumptions made about the types of programs that these processors will execute. However, detailed and accurate program characterization, such as those in this project, allows processor designers to make intelligent and informed engineering decisions.","title":"Experimental Software Systems: Performance Impact of Contemporary Programming Paradigms and Workloads","awardID":"9807112","effectiveDate":"1998-09-15","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"4725","name":"EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS\/CADRE"}}],"PIcoPI":["556800","308217"],"PO":["241298"]},"33944":{"abstract":"This award, in the SGER mode, funds an initial exploration and prototyping of personal devices, controlled by physiological signals, for the purpose of augmenting human function.

Consequently, if a user's decision is based only on some subset of answers retrieved from the database, certain vendors may end up getting preferential treatment. Thus, online databases used in browsing and purchasing will be forced to develop \"fair\" information presentation issues. This project aims to develop information presentation strategies for such networked environments. A novel approach is being explored to create \"fair\" presentation models based on explicit contracts between vendors and the database system. Such contracts specify how often a given object is to be displayed in response to relevant user queries. In particular, query processing algorithms with respect to the display size of the client are being developed. Moreover, a prototype is built to experiment with the theoretical performance of the algorithms with respect to scalability.

Robust information systems will adapt both their functions and performance in response to changes in system goals, changes in performance requirements, and changes in the available software and hardware resources. A multi-agent architecture appropriate for such systems is being developed that contains component technologies for local agent scheduling, multi-agent coordination, organizational design, detection and diagnosis of inappropriate behavior in face of environmental change, and on-line learning to improve the performance of the other components.

Unless a very powerful error control coding technique is used, the misdecoding error probability for a very noisy channel is usually high. Since the use of very powerful error control coding technique will offset a large part of the gain obtained in data compression, this is not what we are willing to do. On the other hand, most of the efficient data compression algorithms are very sensitive to channel errors. The contradiction between high decoding error probability and catastrophic behavior of compression algorithms is the main problem we need to resolve in the study of transmission of compressed data through very noisy channels. In this project, we are examining an alternative approach to this problem. Instead of using source codes of small block length, or powerful error control coding techniques, we are developing robust data compression algorithms - algorithms which are insensitive to channel errors. We give two definitions of robustness of lossless data compression - the asymptotical mean robustness and the asymptotical mean semi-robustness - defined with respect to certain distortion measures. The most important distortion measures we use are Hamming distance and the so-called insertion-deletion distance. In this project, we propose 1) to study the existence of asymptotical mean robust lossless data compression algorithm that is also asymptotically optimal; 2) to develop practical asymptotically mean robust (semi-robust) lossless data compression algorithms; 3) to study various important properties of asymptotically mean robust (semi-robust) lossless data compression algorithms.","title":"Robustness of Source Coding","awardID":"9805342","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2003-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4096","name":"COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["554954"],"PO":["188393"]},"30019":{"abstract":"The goal of this research is to develop a robotic system that will extend a human's ability to perform small-scale (sub-millimeter) manipulation tasks requiring human judgement, sensory integration and hand-eye coordination.

Many such systems are being used in life-critical and other important applications, where the failure of the computer to meet some deadlines can have disastrous consequences. The need therefore exists to accurately evaluate the reliability of such computers. Failure in a real-time system can occur due to timing as well as to traditional causes such as hardware failure. Timing overruns are often the consequence of a complicated series of interactions between various elements of the computer, such as individual application tasks, the operating system, the scheduling algorithm, the system architecture, component transient and permanent failure characteristics among other things. It is hard to take account of such interactions in analytical models without resorting to simplifying assumptions which raise questions about the models' accuracy and validity. Furthermore, traditional simulation to validate analytical models is very difficult because the failure rates that are being validated tend to be very low: system failure rates as low as .000000001 are involved. An earlier NSF-funded project developed the Rational Interpolation technique, and showed its usefulness in may compute applications. It created a framework in which various difficult modeling, control, and optimization issues can be attacked. The results indicate that Rational Interpolation is a powerful tool that can be used to complement other mechanisms of reliability and performance evaluation, especially in predicting very low failure rates.

University of Maryland, College Park Experimental Software Systems: Hardware-Software Co-Design of an Experimental Real-Time Operating System and Microcontroller Architecture A hardware-software co-design strategy is being used to create an environment for real-time embedded systems, comprising a real-time operating system (RTOS) for microcontrollers, and a set of hardware mechanisms that enhance a microarchitecture's real-time capabilities. The project validates this experimental system through extensive testing on a simulated processor, and measures the cost-effectiveness of the hardware architecture extensions over a wide range of design choices. The central contribution on the hardware side is the addition of multiple \"nanoprocessors\" and software-managed caches to the main processor core; each of these is a software-configurable finite state machine (FSM) with limited processing capabilities, but each has access to most of the processor state. These hardware mechanisms are orthogonal to the underlying microarchitecture and can be implemented inexpensively even in a low-cost microcontroller. The RTOS implements all of its high-overhead operating system functions as FSMs that are mapped onto the configurable hardware. Each of the nanoprocessors becomes a personal assistant to the operating system, performing mundane tasks such as prioritizing interrupts, filtering input\/output, or acting as high-resolution timers. This leaves the full 100% of CPU processing time on the main processor core for applications.","title":"Experimental Software Systems: Hardware-Software Co-Design of an Experimental Real-Time Operating System and a Microcontroller Architecture","awardID":"9806645","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"4725","name":"EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS\/CADRE"}}],"PIcoPI":["561880","283200"],"PO":["179487"]},"31648":{"abstract":"9806822 Essa, Irfan A. Abowd, Gregory D. Georgia Institute of Technology Experimental Software Systems: Automated Understanding of Captured Experience The objective of this research is to reduce substantially the human input necessary for creating and accessing large collections of multimedia, particularly multimedia created by capturing what is happening in an environment. The existing software system which is being used as the starting point for this investigation is Classroom 2000, a system designed to capture what happens in classrooms, meetings, and offices. Classroom 2000 integrates and synchronizes multiple streams of captured text, images, handwritten annotations, audio, and video. In a sense, it automates note-taking for a lecture or meeting. The research challenge is to make sense of this flood of captured data. The project explores how the output of Classroom 2000 can be automatically structured, segmented, indexed, and linked. Machine learning and statistical approaches to language are used to attempt to understand the captured data. Techniques from computational perception are used to try to find structure in the captured data. An important component of this research is the experimental analysis of the software system being built. The expectation is that this research will have a dramatic impact on how humans work and learn, as technology aids humans by capturing and making accessible what happens in an environment.","title":"Experimental Software Systems: Automated Understanding of Captured Experience","awardID":"9806822","effectiveDate":"1998-09-01","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4725","name":"EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS\/CADRE"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0804","name":"Division of EMERGING FRONTIERS","abbr":"EF"},"pgm":{"id":"6850","name":"DIGITAL SOCIETY&TECHNOLOGIES"}}],"PIcoPI":["438708","564690","563803","508256"],"PO":["241298"]},"32638":{"abstract":"This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's \"Connections to the Internet\" announcement, NSF 96-64.

In particular, the focus is on high-speed wide-area networks (WANs) where the propagation latency is the dominant communication cost, the migration of large amounts of data is not an issue, and efficient multicasting and guarantees on network Quality of Service (QoS) parameters are available. In this project, existing concurrency control, commit and recovery protocols are being evaluated with respect to performance scalability under the new network assumptions. Further, new protocols are being developed that utilize the huge bandwidth and minimize the number of sequential phases of messages exploiting the multicasting capability and the provision of QoS guarantees such as bounded end-to-end packet delay and packet loss. At the same time, because of the need to scale to thousands of clients and servers, not all of which may be operational at any given time, the new WAN data management protocols are designed to achieve higher site autonomy in a cooperative manner, reducing global synchronization and supporting disconnected operations. The various protocols are empirically evaluated using computer simulation under different scenarios. The results of this research are expected to provide a better insight into the synergy between database and network technologies. This, in turn, will facilitate the deployment of future high performance WAN data server systems which are part of the necessary infrastructure that will support important nation- and world-wide applications such as electronic commerce and other web-based applications. <br\/><br\/>http:\/\/www.cs.pitt.edu\/admt\/projects\/wands.html","title":"Reliable Data Sharing in Wide Area Gigabit Networked Databases","awardID":"9812532","effectiveDate":"1998-09-15","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}}],"PIcoPI":["532922",84604],"PO":["563751"]},"33518":{"abstract":"9812240 Aspray, William Freeman, Peter A Association of Computing Machinery Special Project: Demand for Information Workers from the Perspective of Core Producers This award supports the development of a study to examine the information worker shortage primarily as it relates to four-year educational programs in the core computing fields: computer science, and engineering.

This enables academics to see research from a practitioner's viewpoint and motivates the discussion on mutual support of academic-industrial research. Such mutual support might include visits from academics to industry or vice-versa, access to software packages, source code (possibly old source code), data sets, student visits to industry, industry support of students and so forth. In addition, the barriers to industrial-academic collaboration and technology transfer are to be discussed and potential solutions proposed. The objective of this workshop is to find out how to set up mechanisms of mutual support for academic-industrial research collaboration and to publicize these mechanisms.

It promotes faculty development activities and supports minority faculty members as they complete there Ph.D. programs. Through project LEARN, more students participate in faculty research in areas such as: Agent-Based Systems, Spatial Data Analysis, Real-Time Operating Systems, and Pedagogical Research on Multimedia and Distance Learning applications. This award will stir the department of Computer Science from 'mainly teaching' towards 'teaching and research'. The existing MIE Summer Academy Program will be expanded to attract more minority\/women students to pursue Computer Science studies at BSU. A Student-based Support Network, enhancing the student-to-student academic support system and providing a forum for tutoring, mutual support and self realization), will be established. Project LEARN makes a significant impact on the whole chain of issues which are related to minority student recruitment, mentoring, research assignments, financial support, academic performance monitoring, networking and group-based activities and placement in graduate schools. Through this effort, Bowie State University is expected to develop further its computing science research capabilities involving minority students in greater numbers, paving the way for eventual increase in underrepresented degrees in the pipeline.

Boston University Experimental Software Systems: Collaborative Research: Applications of Flow Types in the Efficient, Modular, and Reliable Compilation of Higher-Order Typed Languages Modern programming languages (e.g. ML, Haskell, Scheme, Java) have several expressive features that let programmers abstract away from low-level, system-specific details and achieve benefits like code safety, code reuse, and modularity.
