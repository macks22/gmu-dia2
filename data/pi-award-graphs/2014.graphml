      <data key="e_title">AF: Small: Volumetric Alignment of Protein Cavities for the Analysis of Ligand Binding Specificity</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The alignment of protein structures is essential for the study of protein function. Superposing the binding cavities of one protein onto another can reveal shape similarities that explain why two proteins bind a similar molecular partner. Superposition can also expose critical differences that explain why proteins sometimes bind very different partners. These observations, made by experts in structural biology with the computational aid of protein structure alignments, help construct our atomic-level understanding of protein binding preferences. Protein binding preferences lie at the crux of many pressing challenges in protein engineering, systems biology, drug design, and other fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project considers a new approach to protein structure alignment that generates superposition by maximizing the overlapping volume between binding cavities. Two core research directions will be considered: (1) The development of specialized optimization techniques that rapidly and reliably explore the continuous space of alignments and (2) the usage of biological and biophysical data to enhance the alignment process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed work advances the study of protein structure comparison with new representations of protein structure and new geometric superposition techniques. A novel focus on closely related proteins also diverges from existing methods, which generally target proteins with distant evolutionary ties. The project advances techniques in mathematical optimization for accommodating the noisy and expensive estimation of overlapping cavity volume. Accommodations of this nature are an emerging challenge in optimization, where the function being optimized is frequently the result of imprecise and expensive computations, like simulations. The low dimensionality of the cavity alignment problem, coupled with the opportunity to optimize in the presence of noise and imprecision creates a unique opportunity to advance techniques for this general challenge in optimization. In structural biology, the proposed work will add automation and precision to existing workflows, enabling the examination of more structures than humans can fully consider and identifying molecular subtleties that might otherwise be overlooked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project also focuses on developing interactive software for protein structure comparison. This software will provide a visual and intuitive interface, helping students and scientists from non-computational background to better use and understand software in structural bioinformatics. The research itself and the development of the interface software will expose graduate and undergraduate students with mono-disciplinary backgrounds to an interdisciplinary research program in bioinformatics, and train them in cross-disciplinary communication.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Harvard University will undertake a retrospective cohort study to analyze college students? education background and previous IT-related experiences for predictors of performance when students study Computer Science in college, while controlling for demographic differences. The study will reveal how decisions concerning the use of technology made by high school teachers in the teaching of science and mathematics and the growing number of high school computer science courses relate to the performance of 12,000 college computer science students nationwide, who will be recruited from randomly selected 2-year and 4-year colleges and universities. This study has the capacity to both reveal and evaluate the use of the most promising educational practices and interventions, including both in-school computing instruction and after-school programs, competitions, and clubs, and to assess the effects of a match between experiences during the high school years with the evolving landscape of introductory college computer science courses. Such knowledge can only help to ameliorate the high failure rates that prematurely end the pursuit of a potential computer science degree, especially for females and under-represented minorities who historically opt out of this field earlier and in greater numbers than other classmates. Both college and high school computer science instructors can also benefit from understanding the factors contributing to effective preparation for students? first college computer science course.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project will develop, implement, and evaluate a novel, scalable and transferable virtual reality (VR) based pedagogical ecosystem that provides learners with the relevant skill training to address existing skilled worker shortage in the area of green energy and environmental engineering. This will facilitate the growth of new jobs and training opportunities for entry-level positions in this sector. Specifically, the ecosystem will use cloud services such as the Amazon Web Services (AWS) for backend technology and 3-D gaming engines such as Unity3d for front-end rendering to create immersive educational modules that cover technical topics on green energy and environmental engineering. The ecosystem will introduce and sustain inside and outside the classroom: 1) a unique blend of cloud-based self-contained VR modules from STEM areas of environmental engineering that feature student deliverables such as virtual renewable energy installations (wind-farms, solar-farms, etc.) for optimal energy generation, and virtual designs for energy automation systems along with strategies to operate them at optimal capacity 2) a cloud-based technological framework to deliver VR educational modules, and 3) a play-based learning pedagogical model Play-Curricular activity-Reflection and Discussion (PCaRD) that assess the application of students? independent thought processes, along with design and operational skills in creating these deliverables. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creation of a VR-based pedagogical ecosystem in the context of the specific green energy themes will provide insight into the opportunities for using computation and bandwidth as a replacement for selected physical laboratories and field trips. The instrumentation of the VR modules will provide data on the impact of network bandwidth and latency on the educational experience. This data will be directly useful for designing and provisioning larger scale US Ignite VR-based education projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pathways to the classroom include community college level of education via Drexel?s partnership with Burlington County College, high schools via an active GK-12 grant, and undergraduate courses at Drexel?s College of Engineering. The implementation plan, course materials, and associated technology will be regularly updated and made available to the public via a highly interactive web portal in a format that is easily adaptable for implementation in other universities. The results generated from this effort will be shared via education research conferences, journals and venues, and will help inform 1) the US IGNITE community of the benefits and limitations of using the proposed pedagogical ecosystem, and 2) the ongoing national dialogue on cloud-based VR education, thereby helping all stakeholders better align their educational efforts.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project will develop, implement, and evaluate a novel, scalable and transferable virtual reality (VR) based pedagogical ecosystem that provides learners with the relevant skill training to address existing skilled worker shortage in the area of green energy and environmental engineering. This will facilitate the growth of new jobs and training opportunities for entry-level positions in this sector. Specifically, the ecosystem will use cloud services such as the Amazon Web Services (AWS) for backend technology and 3-D gaming engines such as Unity3d for front-end rendering to create immersive educational modules that cover technical topics on green energy and environmental engineering. The ecosystem will introduce and sustain inside and outside the classroom: 1) a unique blend of cloud-based self-contained VR modules from STEM areas of environmental engineering that feature student deliverables such as virtual renewable energy installations (wind-farms, solar-farms, etc.) for optimal energy generation, and virtual designs for energy automation systems along with strategies to operate them at optimal capacity 2) a cloud-based technological framework to deliver VR educational modules, and 3) a play-based learning pedagogical model Play-Curricular activity-Reflection and Discussion (PCaRD) that assess the application of students? independent thought processes, along with design and operational skills in creating these deliverables. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creation of a VR-based pedagogical ecosystem in the context of the specific green energy themes will provide insight into the opportunities for using computation and bandwidth as a replacement for selected physical laboratories and field trips. The instrumentation of the VR modules will provide data on the impact of network bandwidth and latency on the educational experience. This data will be directly useful for designing and provisioning larger scale US Ignite VR-based education projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pathways to the classroom include community college level of education via Drexel?s partnership with Burlington County College, high schools via an active GK-12 grant, and undergraduate courses at Drexel?s College of Engineering. The implementation plan, course materials, and associated technology will be regularly updated and made available to the public via a highly interactive web portal in a format that is easily adaptable for implementation in other universities. The results generated from this effort will be shared via education research conferences, journals and venues, and will help inform 1) the US IGNITE community of the benefits and limitations of using the proposed pedagogical ecosystem, and 2) the ongoing national dialogue on cloud-based VR education, thereby helping all stakeholders better align their educational efforts.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1329875 (Hu). Despite their importance within the energy sector, buildings have not kept pace with technological improvements and particularly the introduction of intelligent features. A primary obstacle in enabling intelligent buildings is their highly distributed and diffuse nature. To address this challenge, a modular approach will be investigated for building design, construction, and operation that would completely transform the building industry. Buildings would be assembled from a set of pre-engineered intelligent modules and commissioned on site in a &quot;plug-and-play&quot; manner much like a &quot;LEGO&quot; set but with added capability of (a) allowing for easy configuration and re-configuration that can be integrated to provide delivery of thermal and visual comfort, ventilation; (b) providing optimized controls in terms of overall occupant satisfaction and energy efficiency and performance monitoring. The primary goal of the research is to develop and demonstrate innovative concepts for distributed intelligence along with a new paradigm for plug-and-play building control that is a necessary precursor in enabling this transformation. To accomplish these tasks, the investigators constitute a multidisciplinary team with expertise from three engineering disciplines, namely Civil (Architectural), Mechanical, Electrical and Computer Engineering. The intellectual merit of this research lies in developing a unified approach that advances the engineering of cyber-physical systems (CPS) for buildings by contributing to the following fields: (a) modeling and identification of building subsystems and integrated systems; (b) multi-agent system networks that enable distributed intelligent monitoring and control of multi-zone buildings; (c) optimal control algorithms for stochastic hybrid systems that can optimize the operation of buildings with mode changes under uncertainty. These contributions will be integrated in simulation and experimental platforms for multi-agent building system networks to validate the developed algorithms and to provide a new CPS-based technological solution to the control and optimization of modular buildings. An initial knowledge/technology base will be provided for scalable, adaptive, robust, and efficient engineering solutions for cyber-enabled building systems that will transform the current building operation practice, enabling the next generation of smart buildings with optimized comfort delivery and energy use. The broader impacts of this project are: (a) Theoretical development of modeling representations, algorithms, and simulation tools that will impact a number of scientific communities, including Civil/Architectural, Mechanical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Operations Research. The proposed new principles for heterogeneous multi-agent system networks, distributed intelligence, and optimal hybrid control algorithms will have impacts in a diverse range of fields outside of building systems such as power systems, transportation systems, robotics, etc.; (b) Integration of the proposed modeling, simulation, and experimental platforms into new teaching modules and experiential learning activities that support the curriculum development in three engineering schools and Purdue?s first year engineering program; (c) Dissemination of research outcomes to the industry to open up a new horizon of business and economy that would enable the growth of green and intelligent buildings; (d) The creation of outreach and engagement initiatives that motivate K-12 teachers and students in STEM learning and research, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in engineering, and motivate undergraduate students to participate in research related to emerging CPS topics.</data>

It will transmit data wirelessly through acoustic waves from sub-surface ocean sensors to a receiving array with a surface connection to satellites and the Internet. The PIs will expand the limits and capabilities of underwater communication networks in the transition zone where sea ice changes from 1) smooth land-fast ice to 2) ridged mobile ice to 3) open water. This transition zone evolves in both time and space within the 30-50 km foot-print of the proposed networked sensor and communication network array. This goal requires integration of both existing knowledge from a set of diverse disciplines and intellectual innovations within each discipline. It will modify underwater communication network theory, coastal acoustic propagation and scattering, and experimental design of oceanography. Providing long-term, long-range acoustic connectivity, the PI team will address three major new research challenges: 1) Mid-frequency (1-5 kHz), mid-range (10 km) acoustic wave propagation in the transition zone; 2) Data telemetry in the new communication environment; and 3) Resilient sensor networks that cope with and harness complex dynamics of the transition zone. The multi-disciplinary team will implement reliable modem hardware, integrate it with resilient network protocol, and optimize the system design for Arctic deployment to support an ocean experiment off Thule, Greenland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sensor and communication network will support 1) long-term, intelligent distributed Arctic observing systems, 2) assimilation of remote-sensing and in-situ under-ice measurements, and 3) regional and global climate modeling with real-time measurements. Such a network holds the promise to revolutionize under-ice ocean sampling in polar regions. Data will be broadly disseminated via the web and archived for public access. Planned outreach includes participation in the field program of Greenlandic residents from the Inupiat village of Qaanaaq and meaningful classroom involvement from the elementary to community college levels.

      <data key="e_title">INSPIRE Track 1: Acoustic Sensor Networks for Ice-Covered Seas</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Arctic Natural Sciences Program in the Division of Polar Programs in the Directorate for Geosciences, the Communications, Circuits and Sensing Systems Program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems in the Directorate for Engineering,and the Division of Computer and network Systems in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to design and develop an integrated underwater acoustic sensor network for ice-covered&lt;br/&gt;seas. It will transmit data wirelessly through acoustic waves from sub-surface ocean sensors to a receiving array with a surface connection to satellites and the Internet. The PIs will expand the limits and capabilities of underwater communication networks in the transition zone where sea ice changes from 1) smooth land-fast ice to 2) ridged mobile ice to 3) open water. This transition zone evolves in both time and space within the 30-50 km foot-print of the proposed networked sensor and communication network array. This goal requires integration of both existing knowledge from a set of diverse disciplines and intellectual innovations within each discipline. It will modify underwater communication network theory, coastal acoustic propagation and scattering, and experimental design of oceanography. Providing long-term, long-range acoustic connectivity, the PI team will address three major new research challenges: 1) Mid-frequency (1-5 kHz), mid-range (10 km) acoustic wave propagation in the transition zone; 2) Data telemetry in the new communication environment; and 3) Resilient sensor networks that cope with and harness complex dynamics of the transition zone. The multi-disciplinary team will implement reliable modem hardware, integrate it with resilient network protocol, and optimize the system design for Arctic deployment to support an ocean experiment off Thule, Greenland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sensor and communication network will support 1) long-term, intelligent distributed Arctic observing systems, 2) assimilation of remote-sensing and in-situ under-ice measurements, and 3) regional and global climate modeling with real-time measurements. Such a network holds the promise to revolutionize under-ice ocean sampling in polar regions. Data will be broadly disseminated via the web and archived for public access. Planned outreach includes participation in the field program of Greenlandic residents from the Inupiat village of Qaanaaq and meaningful classroom involvement from the elementary to community college levels. The PIs are also committed to outreach through their global print, radio, TV, and electronic media contacts.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Cleveland State University (CSU) in collaboration with the University of California San Diego (UCSD), proposes CISS -- Computing in Secondary Schools -- a CS10K project designed to provide computer science education professional development to high school teachers throughout the state of Ohio. Through participation in CISS, high school teachers will become fluent in computational thinking and will develop the skills needed to teach the new AP CS Principles course. The teachers will be supported through access to course materials, pedagogy, mentoring, weekly telephone meetings, mid-year workshops and technical coaches. Teachers will also have access to an online knowledge repository, CS Learning Commons, which will be used to address challenges that arise and share best practices. Specifically the project will (1) recruit, train, and assist 30 high school teachers in teaching CS in their classroom; (2) prepare and teach an open online course focused on CS education, which will include both content knowledge required to teach CS at the high school level as well as the pertinent pedagogical techniques; (3) widen the CS teacher pipeline by offering a teacher licensure pathway; (4) create a replicable network design model for CS teacher training and mentoring by engaging with an online school network; and (5) establish CS mentoring programs for high school teachers with a focus on gender diversification and participation by minority teachers. Additional partners include the Ohio STEM Learning Network (OSLN) and school districts geographically dispersed throughout the state of Ohio. This project will leverage the work already done on ComPASS CS10K award and will increase our understanding of its scaling to a wider audience.</data>

Participation in regular group fitness programs and access to personal trainers is a way to improve the health of individuals, thus increasing lifespans and reducing the overall cost of healthcare. Significant challenges exist in the participation in regular fitness programs including cost, time and geography. There are over 251,000 registered fitness trainers in the USA which deliver group fitness and personal training programs at their local health clubs on a daily basis. This proposal seeks to explore the effectiveness of live broadcast fitness via gigabit networking and the impact of varying the video fidelity. The study will utilize the KinectHealth software application, GENI racks and the OpenFlow networking protocol. Kinect Health 3D was a Bronze price winner in the recent MozillaIgnite competition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obesity and its consequent diseases is a national problem that is a significant component of rising health-care expenditures. Exercise and even modest exercise-driven weight loss can significantly lower fasting blood sugar, improve glucose tolerance, and reduce blood triglyceride levels. This project will explore a network-mediated method of encouraging and facilitating regular exercise and will document its associated bandwidth requirements.</data>

Kinect Health 3D was a Bronze price winner in the recent MozillaIgnite competition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obesity and its consequent diseases is a national problem that is a significant component of rising health-care expenditures. Exercise and even modest exercise-driven weight loss can significantly lower fasting blood sugar, improve glucose tolerance, and reduce blood triglyceride levels. This project will explore a network-mediated method of encouraging and facilitating regular exercise and will document its associated bandwidth requirements.</data>

      <data key="e_title">SCH: EXP: Intelligent Clinical Decision Support with Probabilistic and Temporal EHR Modeling</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Clinical decision support has the potential to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes, while shedding light into policy questions surrounding healthcare costs and practices in the US. This project aims to develop intelligent clinical decision support techniques for recommending optimal action plans - including both diagnostic tests and medical interventions - for treating chronic disease, performing multi-step and adaptive treatments, and modifying long-term health habits. In an effort to integrate evidence-driven decision-making with established clinical practices, the research will develop disease-agnostic artificial intelligence techniques that combine data from large electronic health records (EHRs) with recommendations from human experts. A prototype decision support system will be tested on three clinical settings - cardiology, clinical depression, and emergency room readmission - using existing EHR datasets and consultation with domain experts from clinical partners. Outcomes-driven and cost-driven optimized decisions will be compared to current clinical practice. This exploratory research will provide the groundwork for follow-up projects in decision support information presentation, integration with clinical workflow and IT systems, and making the transition from retrospective studies to clinical trials. Other broader impacts include workshops for healthcare applications of AI, and women and minority students will be recruited and mentored in graduate and undergraduate computer science research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical approach of this research builds on state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to automatically learn, simulate, and reason about patient-specific treatment plans. Such methods must be simultaneously probabilistic and temporal. Probabilistic techniques are needed to handle significant uncertainties in clinical diagnoses and outcomes, much like a human clinician would. Temporal techniques are needed to consider sequences of future decisions over the course of treatment, rather than decisions at single time points. More specifically, this project will consider the use of statistical relational learning (SRL) techniques to mine for probabilistic, temporal patterns in large electronic health records, and these patterns will be used in partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that exhaustively search for optimal treatment sequences. Recent results indicate that SRL achieves superior performance to other machine learning methods in predicting cardiac arrest from demographic and lifestyle observations, and POMDP treatment plans outperform existing fee-for-service practices by reducing costs by 50% and improving outcomes by 40% on a clinical depression dataset. By combining SRL and POMDPs, specifically, using SRL to learn a disease progression model used by the POMDP, this project aims to achieve further improvements in recommendation quality and computational scalability for complex treatments. Furthermore, because EHRs may suffer from limited or missing data, clinical decision support tools should follow established practices and expert knowledge when necessary. To do so, new workflows for integrating expert knowledge into SRL and POMDPs will be explored. Evaluation will be performed on a variety of disease scenarios in conjunction with clinical partners at Marshfield Clinic, Centerstone, Wake Forest School of Medicine, and South Bend Memorial Hospital.</data>

      <data key="e_title">CGV: Small: Mesh-based Simulation of Thin Liquid Structures</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">In this research the PI will develop efficient mesh-based algorithms to simulate the dynamics and interactions of thin liquid structures such as sheets, jets, bubbles, and films. The thin geometry of these liquid phenomena poses tremendous difficulties for traditional techniques, leading to long runtimes and excessive memory consumption. The PI argues that a fundamentally different approach that recognizes and exploits the unique geometry of thin liquids is needed in order to simulate them efficiently and accurately (by analogy with the special treatment of thin elastic bodies such as rods, plates, shells). The project is comprised of three thrusts. First, the PI will develop algorithms for the dynamic simulation of liquid bodies composed of high viscosity threads and sheets, including physical modeling, collision processing, topology changes, and mixed dimensional remeshing. Second, he will address the specific challenges of low viscosity jets and sheets, considering in particular the enhanced influence of surface tension, sheet breakup, and the choice of Eulerian vs. Lagrangian evolution. Finally, he will examine the deformations of films, bubbles, and foams, using a new mesh-based representation for deforming multi-region interfaces, coupled to the fluid dynamics of the surrounding air. In each thrust, the predictive power of the techniques developed will be validated against both experimental observations and theoretical results from the literature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To these ends, the PI will bring several geometric and computational techniques from the dynamics of thin elastica to bear on the dynamics of thin fluids. The PI believes this cross-pollination of ideas has the potential to provide dramatic improvements in efficiency and accuracy, while yielding computational tools that complement theory and experiment in the study of thin fluid phenomena. By considering a thin material as a lower dimensional object (curve or surface) with an associated thickness, the dimension of the problem can be reduced, yielding improved numerical properties and better allocation of degrees of freedom. This perspective has never before been applied to develop computational techniques for three-dimensional thin liquids. The use of non-manifold meshes to represent mixed bodies of thin liquids also opens up previously unexplored challenges in mixed dimensional remeshing and the handling of topological transitions. Furthermore, the proposed surface tracking representation builds on robust collision-processing techniques originally applied to cloth animation, and will offer the first surface mesh-based technique for the evolution of multi-material interfaces. This will allow for more accurate tracking of bubbles and general multiphase flows than can be achieved with state-of-the-art implicit surface approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Thin liquids are crucial to a broad class of problems in computer graphics, engineering, and scientific applications. Liquid animations are increasingly prevalent in visual effects-driven films, yet thin splashes remain among the most difficult effects to animate. Thin threads and sheets of viscous liquids arise in applications from food processing to cosmetics, from the geophysics of the earth&apos;s crust to the forming and blowing of elaborate glass artwork. They are the subject of substantial concurrent experimental and theoretical investigation, and complementary computational tools for these problems could offer vital new insights. The potential applications for low viscosity liquids and foams are equally wide-ranging. Project outcomes will be reported at major international venues including the SIGGRAPH conferences, and the associated computational tools will be made publicly available. A variety of education and outreach efforts, some of which specifically target minority middle school students, are also planned.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">A fundamental operation for users in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) to access the spectrum is channel rendezvous. After rendezvous is established, channel information exchange and propagation among users are also essential for efficient spectrum access. Existing studies on channel rendezvous in CRNs have limitations and are unsuitable for efficient access scenarios. Additional information about users can help generate intelligent designs in CRNs that can shorten spectrum access delay. However, due to practical constraints, such information is extremely difficult to obtain before rendezvous is established. Mining the social patterns of CR users (or secondary users, SUs) and intelligently utilizing the captured social information is a promising approach. The objective of this project is to design, analyze, and evaluate fast and efficient spectrum access schemes for CRNs without a common control channel. One unique feature of this work is the consideration of SU social patterns and the incorporation of social analysis to enhance spectrum access efficiency. The approach involves analyzing the time, location, and spectrum-dependent social patterns of SUs; identifying and addressing new challenges in channel rendezvous, security, and recommendation designs with the assistance of SU social analysis; and proactively utilizing social patterns of SUs for fully distributed fast and secure spectrum access design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have a significant impact on efficient spectrum access. Social analysis of users is a critical component to further enhance spectrum access efficiency and accelerate CRN deployment. This interdisciplinary research is potentially transformative as it will help generate innovative techniques to numerous CRN applications.

      <data key="e_title">SCH: INT: Supporting Healthy Sleep Behaviors through Ubiquitous Computing</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Sleep is one of the key aspects of good health, along with a healthy diet and regular exercise. Computing researchers have recently worked to understand how systems can support nutrition and exercise, but sleep has been relatively under-studied despite its significant health benefits. The right amount of quality sleep can improve both physical and mental health and is associated with a lower risk for heart disease, diabetes, depression, and obesity. However, sleep disorders are often undiagnosed, and many people are unaware of how their activities or environments affect sleep. Ubiquitous computing has the opportunity to help through self-monitoring, awareness, and identification of strategies to promote healthy sleep behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary research agenda will involve the design, development, and evaluation of novel ubiquitous computing approaches to support good sleep health and behaviors. This research will combine expertise in human-centered design, computer science, sleep medicine, and nursing. The researchers&apos; previous formative work with target users and sleep experts has informed design requirements for technologies in this field. The work will focus on building on those results through three main activities. First, they will apply machine learning to model sleep patterns based on a person&apos;s smartphone usage to unobtrusively sense and predict sleep duration and timing. Then they will employ a human-centered design process to develop and study the feasibility and initial efficacy of two novel software tools to assist individuals in sensing, recording, and visualizing the behavioral (e.g., caffeine use, food intake) and environmental factors (e.g., noisy environment, light levels) that can disrupt their sleep. And then, they will develop and assess the feasibility and initial efficacy of a new technique and tool for assessing, modeling, and visualizing the impact of sleep deprivation on users&apos; reaction time, cognitive functioning, and mood to help them prioritize sleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will bring into focus the domain of sleep as a new area for human-centered computing research. The design and evaluation of new applications for sleep will further knowledge of how technology can be designed for long-term health tracking and behavior change, and the designs and evaluations move beyond what is currently being addressed in industry. The technical contributions are novel approaches to monitoring sleep and an expansion of knowledge about how technologies can adapt to meet the unique health needs of different users. Finally, the research seeks to unite the fields of sleep research and computing research to develop solutions for better understanding and treating sleep disorders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work has the potential to significantly affect the lives of the estimated 40.6 million individuals in the U.S. with sleep disorders or sleep deprivation, which helps address a major public health issue. In addition, the economic cost of sleep deprivation has been estimated to be $63.8 billion per year. The research will have immediate impact by allowing free access to new behavior change technologies developed through this project. In addition, the research will also impact education by using sleep research as a means for attracting women and minorities to computing research and engaging students in interdisciplinary design teams through student projects and directed research groups.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Sleep is one of the key aspects of good health, along with a healthy diet and regular exercise. Computing researchers have recently worked to understand how systems can support nutrition and exercise, but sleep has been relatively under-studied despite its significant health benefits. The right amount of quality sleep can improve both physical and mental health and is associated with a lower risk for heart disease, diabetes, depression, and obesity. However, sleep disorders are often undiagnosed, and many people are unaware of how their activities or environments affect sleep. Ubiquitous computing has the opportunity to help through self-monitoring, awareness, and identification of strategies to promote healthy sleep behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary research agenda will involve the design, development, and evaluation of novel ubiquitous computing approaches to support good sleep health and behaviors. This research will combine expertise in human-centered design, computer science, sleep medicine, and nursing. The researchers&apos; previous formative work with target users and sleep experts has informed design requirements for technologies in this field. The work will focus on building on those results through three main activities. First, they will apply machine learning to model sleep patterns based on a person&apos;s smartphone usage to unobtrusively sense and predict sleep duration and timing.

In spite of the promise, so far evolved robots only do simple things like walk, navigate, or pick up objects. What limits progress is a lack of understanding of &quot;evolvability,&quot; the capacity of organisms (or robots) to change and become more complex. Understanding evolvability is the main goal of this project: researchers will borrow ideas from modern genetics so their robots mutate and develop in ways that are similar to how biological creatures do.

By linking complexity, genetics, and evolution, this project seeks to discover new principles that can be applied in science and industry. To help convert scientific principles into innovation drivers, online software will be created to show how to evolve virtual or physical robots; this will help students learn about engineering, biology, and how to apply both to technology. Finally, evolutionary robotics can be used to solve complex problems in robotic control that defy logical programming solutions, so this research can help companies that manufacture robots.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Evolutionary Processes program in the Division of Environmental Biology in the Directorate for Biological Sciences, the Behavioral Systems program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems in the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Information Integration and Informatics program in the Division of Information &amp; Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For millennia, humans have bred organisms to produce better food, clothes, and companionship. Recently, scientists have learned how to breed robots, evolving simulated creatures in virtual worlds, or physical robots in the real world. By combining the evolutionary process with robotic engineering, more complex and novel designs should be possible compared to traditional methods. In spite of the promise, so far evolved robots only do simple things like walk, navigate, or pick up objects. What limits progress is a lack of understanding of &quot;evolvability,&quot; the capacity of organisms (or robots) to change and become more complex. Understanding evolvability is the main goal of this project: researchers will borrow ideas from modern genetics so their robots mutate and develop in ways that are similar to how biological creatures do. In theory, this could produce simple robots that evolve into ever more complex, capable and useful robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how complexity evolves is central to the study of life, and may enable even non-specialists to automatically and continuously produce diverse kinds of machines. By linking complexity, genetics, and evolution, this project seeks to discover new principles that can be applied in science and industry. To help convert scientific principles into innovation drivers, online software will be created to show how to evolve virtual or physical robots; this will help students learn about engineering, biology, and how to apply both to technology. Finally, evolutionary robotics can be used to solve complex problems in robotic control that defy logical programming solutions, so this research can help companies that manufacture robots.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Twin Cities Public TV pilot project--Educational Media to Advance Computer Science (EMACS)--is a collaboration of Twin Cities Public Television (tpt), the Department of Computer Science at Carleton College, and the STEM Education Center at the University of Minnesota. The goal of the pilot project is to establish the effectiveness of a media-based instructional model to enhance high school computer science teachers&apos; content and pedagogical knowledge and ability to teach Advanced Placement® Computer Science Principles (AP® CSP). The EMACS Pilot will involve students in a media-enhanced exploration of infrastructure systems to increase their awareness and understanding of real-world applications of computer science and the importance of computational thinking in everyday life. Deliverables will include a standards- aligned, media-based supplementary curriculum module that promotes inquiry-driven investigation of how computer science is applied to infrastructure systems, a detailed outline of a teacher professional development (PD) program, a wireframe model of an online environment for the teacher PD experience, and a formative evaluation on the appeal and educational impact of the module on students and their teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The alignment of the pilot module with the concepts and computational thinking practices that comprise the AP CSP course will be facilitated by active involvement with representatives from the College Board, the AP CSP course development team, and an external project advisory group. A selection of the seven &quot;Big Ideas&quot; within that framework (i.e., Creativity, Abstraction, Data, Algorithms, Programming, Internet, and Impact) will be brought to life through video and an applied programming activity. The project will employ the graphical programming environment Scratch, providing a rich platform for building simulations of infrastructure systems. Building on an award-winning track record of using video of &quot;real kids doing real science&quot; as a tool to foster interest in STEM and model scientific processes (e.g., tpt&apos;s PBS series DragonflyTV and SciGirls and related learning and professional development tools), coupled with the University of Minnesota&apos;s research on teacher training and impactful and integrated STEM learning opportunities for diverse learners, the EMACS pilot will demonstrate a new approach to support and enhance AP CSP courses. The formative evaluation of the pilot will demonstrate the potential of the model to 1) engage students and improve their understanding of applications of computer science, and 2) improve teachers&apos; understanding and ability to teach core AP CSP principles.</data>

The goal of the pilot project is to establish the effectiveness of a media-based instructional model to enhance high school computer science teachers&apos; content and pedagogical knowledge and ability to teach Advanced Placement® Computer Science Principles (AP® CSP). The EMACS Pilot will involve students in a media-enhanced exploration of infrastructure systems to increase their awareness and understanding of real-world applications of computer science and the importance of computational thinking in everyday life. Deliverables will include a standards- aligned, media-based supplementary curriculum module that promotes inquiry-driven investigation of how computer science is applied to infrastructure systems, a detailed outline of a teacher professional development (PD) program, a wireframe model of an online environment for the teacher PD experience, and a formative evaluation on the appeal and educational impact of the module on students and their teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The alignment of the pilot module with the concepts and computational thinking practices that comprise the AP CSP course will be facilitated by active involvement with representatives from the College Board, the AP CSP course development team, and an external project advisory group. A selection of the seven &quot;Big Ideas&quot; within that framework (i.e., Creativity, Abstraction, Data, Algorithms, Programming, Internet, and Impact) will be brought to life through video and an applied programming activity. The project will employ the graphical programming environment Scratch, providing a rich platform for building simulations of infrastructure systems. Building on an award-winning track record of using video of &quot;real kids doing real science&quot; as a tool to foster interest in STEM and model scientific processes (e.g., tpt&apos;s PBS series DragonflyTV and SciGirls and related learning and professional development tools), coupled with the University of Minnesota&apos;s research on teacher training and impactful and integrated STEM learning opportunities for diverse learners, the EMACS pilot will demonstrate a new approach to support and enhance AP CSP courses. The formative evaluation of the pilot will demonstrate the potential of the model to 1) engage students and improve their understanding of applications of computer science, and 2) improve teachers&apos; understanding and ability to teach core AP CSP principles.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Marquette University, in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin La Crosse, proposes the PUMP-CS Project (Preparing the Upper Midwest for Principles of Computer Science). PUMP-CS will provide a two-track professional development (PD) sequence for endorsing in-service and pre-service teachers--regardless of their prior CS-specific knowledge--to teach the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) or Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) curricula in their classrooms. The first track prepares in-service teachers to lead 9th- or 10th-grade level ECS, which integrates an inquiry- and equity-based pedagogy to convey solid CS content while appealing to a more diverse student population than traditional CS offerings. The second track includes a methods course, Teaching Computer Science (TCS), which enables both pre-service and in-service teachers to add a CS-specific endorsement to their primary certification, while continuing to promote pedagogical reform. This CS methods course is a &quot;missing link&quot; preventing teachers from earning the CS endorsement required to teach a course with more than 25% programming content, (e.g. AP CS or CSP). The planned hybrid/online format for TCS will allow remote teachers in &quot;density-challenged&quot; regions to participate in a supportive learning community as they master the content and methods required. The project team includes members from universities, the Wisconsin-Dairyland chapter of the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), officials from the Department of Public Instruction (DPI), and teachers and administrators from districts across the state. Collectively, they have the diverse institutional knowledge necessary to drive change in state licensure and curriculum standards, to match college-level courses at key universities to the STEM student pipeline, to promote new content and structure for CS teacher preparation, and to rigorously assess the results of this large-scale intervention on teacher education and student learning. This proposed work will lead to regional, sustainable institutional change to improve CS education, and scalable teacher preparation materials ready for other institutions to adopt, and its careful assessment will explore deeper questions of when and how CS teacher preparation can be most effective, and how those lessons can be leveraged in other STEM teaching fields.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Workshop on Frontiers in Image and Video Analysis</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The bombing attacks at the Boston Marathon in April 2013 presented the law enforcement community with significant challenges in terms of the volume and variety of video and still images acquired in the course of the investigation. Tens of thousands of individual media files in multiple formats were submitted from a variety of sources. These sources included broadcast television feeds, private Close-Circuit Television (CCTV) systems, mobile device photographs and videos recovered from the scene, as well as photographs and videos submitted by the public. Teams of analysts reviewed this evidence using mostly manual processes to determine the sequence of events before and after the bombing, ultimately leading to a quick resolution of the case. In the aftermath, it has become evident that the proliferation of video and image recording devices in fixed and mobile devices make it inevitable that a similar situation will occur in future events. As a result, it is incumbent upon the law enforcement community and the U.S. Government at large to further explore the use of automated approaches, available today or in the coming years, to better organize and analyze such large volumes of multimedia data. The findings of this workshop will help define the future research agenda. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of searching for actionable intelligence information from unconstrained images and videos is an unsolved problem. Solving this involves addressing many sub-problems such as video summarization, shot detection/scene change detection, geo-tagging, robust face recognition, human action recognition, semantic description, image recognition and designing human in the loop systems. In addition, issues such as data collection and performance evaluation have to be addressed. Given that several hundreds of videos and a large collection of still images may be available for analysis, there is a great need to develop robust computer vision techniques. While many existing computer vision algorithms perform reasonable well in constrained acquisition conditions, their performance when unconstrained images and videos are given, is less than satisfactory. This workshop precisely addresses the challenges that arise in analyzing a large collection of unstructured image/video collection. This workshop explores the state of the art in algorithms being developed in academia that can support forensic analysis and identification in large volumes of images and videos (e.g., multimedia). The workshop informs long- and near-term research and development efforts aimed at optimally addressing this situation in the future. The workshop identifies those video and image analysis problems which are: (1) Considered solved (i.e., ready to deploy in specific operational scenarios); (2) Nearly solved (i.e., could lead to solutions with one to three years of development); and (3) Over-the-Horizon problems (i.e., those challenges requiring concerted effort over the next 3-5 years and beyond).</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Network densification - where a multitude of base-stations and access points with overlapping wireless footprints and disparate capabilities pervade the physical domain - is the way forward towards meeting the tremendous demand for mobile data. The main objective of this project is to reevaluate the manner in which wireless networks are engineered and spectrum usage is managed so as to exploit dense access infrastructure. The project is expected to make contributions in three areas: 1) Design, analysis and prototyping of communications and network protocols to enable unprecedented fine grain control over transmissions over shared spectrum without requiring high coordination overheads, by leveraging emerging agile access techniques; 2) Design and analysis of novel, simple and sparse-state algorithms that leverage the large flexibility in such systems to achieve near-optimal resource allocations; 3) Modeling and analysis of extreme dense wireless networks to both evaluate the performance of resource sharing between providers in this regime, as well as evaluate economic and policy incentives to deploy a range of contractual structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research activity relies heavily on the development of sound theory and analysis of extremely dense networks, algorithmic development, simulation for large-scale systems and finally prototyping small-scale regimes. The research will serve as a catalyst towards changing traditional wireless networking paradigm, from one where infrastructure points connect to many mobiles, to one where a mobile connects to a large number of infrastructure nodes. The research will be disseminated broadly to researchers, practitioners and policy makers, leveraging in particular, a strong industry focused research center, as well as in efforts reaching out to public high school students, parents and teachers.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">As cognitive radio (CR) research advances to multihop and complex systems over large geographic regions, the spectrum utilization enhancement should be generalized to fully exploit the spectrum usage diversity in three dimensions (3D): time, frequency, and space, with new emphasis on the under-explored spatial dimension. Accordingly, this project focuses on the following three research objectives. The first one is to utilize the recent advancements in statistical learning over big data to develop efficient 3D spectrum sensing schemes, where a hierarchical approach is taken in developing novel finite-bit and single-bit learning techniques to efficiently explore the correlation structure across the three dimensions, with an advanced distributed approach also developed. The second one is to develop two key building blocks in large-scale CR networking based on the 3D spectrum sensing: 1) a novel multi-scale routing scheme to enhance the overall spectrum utilization, with a focus on exploiting the layered spectrum usage correlation structure in the spatial dimension; and 2) a reliable hierarchical common control channel identification scheme. The last research objective is to validate some key aspects in the proposed sensing and networking schemes via both intensive simulations and a concept-proving testbed. Throughout the project, an interdisciplinary approach is taken to combine the methods of statistical learning, signal processing, and wireless networking, with the core built upon the hierarchical treatment of both spectrum usage statistics and CR networking methodologies. The project provides both theories and algorithms for large-scale spectrum sensing and cognitive networking. Through a coherent education plan, the research findings will be incorporated into courses, and disseminated to the community via journal papers and conference presentations.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">An EAGER grant for the Values In Design analysis for Future Internet Architectures--Next Phase (VID4FIA-NP) project supports experimentation with a new model for interdisciplinary collaboration, using the Future Internet Architecture projects as an exciting testbed, and integrating social, ethical, legal, and economic issues with the technical work of the FIA-NP project teams. VID4FIA-NP will build a network of VID experts and find common ground with the challenges faced by the FIA projects, using the VID methodologies for analyzing and designing technology that recommends social values that can serve as design requirements alongside more traditional technical constraints. These activities will produce events that connect VID approaches with the prototyping and testing process, and working papers, possible joint publications and other documents formalizing our findings and methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Within the extensive community of researchers and scholars there are diverse, hotly contested views on what it means to say that technology is or is not value free. There are smaller demonstrations of the claim that features of technology can actively be adjusted to yield morally and socially relevant outcomes. VID4FIA-NP will make significant, convincing contributions to this debate by providing opportunities for social scientists, humanists, economists, legal and policy experts, and technical experts to collaborate on gritty design features that are socially and ethically important. Beyond potential contributions to the general understanding of social dimensions of technology, the project could yield insights into how to operationalize abstract concepts such as security, privacy, etc. and how to implement them in architecture, protocol, mechanism, etc. Not only could these contributions directly affect the FIA-NP projects, they could have significance for IT design generally, and even beyond, to other technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Living with the consequences of technology, it is inevitable that we applaud some and bemoan others. Such evaluation can be retrospective, but for approaches in the VID network, there is commitment to pro-action, making adjustments in material elements of systems and devices systematically can affect socially relevant outcomes. Aware of the pitfalls of naive technological determinism, the payout measured in terms of systems and artifacts that promote--or do not subvert--attainment of societal values, is potentially great. The opportunity to test out these ideas in a research context as ambitious as the FIA-NP projects holds promise for better technology and deeper understanding of the mutual shaping influence of material design on the one hand and values on the other.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project builds a novel privacy-preserving framework with both new algorithms and software tools to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of current identifier-suppression techniques for Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) data; 2) de-identify and anonymize EHR data to protect personal information without significantly reducing the utility of data for secondary data analysis. The proposed techniques eliminate the violation of privacy through re-identification, and facilitate the secondary usage, sharing, publishing and exchange of healthcare data without the risk of breaching protected health information (PHI). This new privacy-preserving framework injects the ICD-9-CM-aware constraint-based privacy-preserving techniques into EHRs to eliminate the threat of identifying an individual in the secondary use of research data. The proposed technique and development can be readily adapted to other types of healthcare databases in order to ensure privacy and prevent re-identification of published data. The project produces groundbreaking algorithms and tools for identifying privacy leakages and protecting personal privacy information in EHRs to improve healthcare data publishing. New privacy-preserving techniques developed in this project lead towards a new type of healthcare science for EHRs. The project also delivers fundamental advancements to engineering by showing how to integrate biomedical domain knowledge with a computationally advanced quantitative framework for preserving the privacy of published EHRs. HIPAA has established protocols and industry standards to protect the confidentiality of PHI. However, our results demonstrate that, even with regard to health data that meets HIPAA requirements, the risk of re-identification is not completely eliminated. By identifying the security vulnerabilities inherent in the HIPAA standards, our research develops a more rigorous security standard that greatly improves privacy protections by applying state-of-the-art algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed data privacy-preserving framework has significant implications for the future of US healthcare data publishing and related applications. Specifically, the transition from paper records to EHRs has accelerated significantly since the passage of the HITECH Act of 2009. The Act provides monetary incentives for the &quot;meaningful use&quot; of EHRs. As a result, the quality and quantity of healthcare databases has risen sharply, which has renewed the public&apos;s fear of a breach of privacy of their medical information. This research work is innovative and crucial not only for facilitating EHR data publishing, but also for enhancing the development and promotion of EHRs. At the educational front, this project facilitates the development of novel educational tools to construct entirely new courses and laboratory classes for healthcare, data privacy, data mining, and a wide range of applications. As a result, it enhances the current instructional methods for teaching data privacy and data mining, and has compelling biomedical and healthcare applications that can facilitate learning of computational algorithms. This project involves both undergraduate and graduate students in the three participating institutions. The PIs make a strong effort to engage minority graduate and undergraduate students in research activities in order to increase their exposure to cutting-edge research.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Asthma is a common lung disease with acute and chronic manifestations that impacts more than 22.2 million Americans or 7.9% of the population, including over 6.7 million children younger than 18 years of age. The cost of asthma is significant both for individuals and for the society as a whole. It is highly desirable to establish transformative technologies to improve the patient quality of life and reduce the cost of asthma management. The recent development in sensor and mobile computing technology provide great opportunities to establish Smart Asthma Management (SAM) systems and achieve a quantum leap in asthma management. Leveraging on the fast development of information infrastructure, patients can create a detailed temporal log recording their symptoms, medicine usage, and possibly vital physiological signals through an easy access to a website or their smart phones in SAM systems. This unprecedented continuous stream of patient-generated data in SAM systems provides us significant opportunities to better estimate patient condition and make clinical intervention decisions. However, since the information infrastructure of SAM has not become available until recently, very limited work is available for SAM systems. Against this background, this collaborative project aims to develop a suite of statistical modeling, monitoring, prognosis, and clinical intervention decision making methodologies based on a flexible yet rigorous multistate model to describe the evolving of patient conditions. The true underlying state of the patient is assumed unknown; however, there is reason to expect that it could be inferred from patient generated data such as the frequency of the rescue inhaler usage (the time and frequency of the rescue inhaler use is an important indicator of asthma control). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some anticipated advances include: (i) Multistate model with event intensity function as observations. The proposed methodology brings the mixed effect model and the multistate model into a unified framework to integrate the population information embedded in the historical records of multiple patients and the individual information collected in real-time in a quantitative way. (ii) Stochastic filtering approach for individual patient condition modeling and updating. The novel state space formulation enables efficient stochastic filtering algorithms to estimate and update the states and parameters in the multistate model. (iii) Clinical intervention decision support for patients and clinicians. The salient features of the proposed policy are that it is based on a condition-based policy and incorporates uncertainties in the patient condition model through a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework which has been widely used and proven to be very effective in the management of industrial systems. Plans are in place to evaluate the effectiveness of the resulting technologies in collaboration with clinical experts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is likely to contribute predictive technologies that could help reduce the cost and improve the quality of healthcare in the US, especially as it relates to effective management of chronic illnessess. Additional broader impacts of the project include enhanced research-based training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students (including members of under-represented minorities) in healthcare engineering, statistics, and operation research; enrichment of the curricula in health systems in industrial engineering and operations research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Iowa.</data>

      <data key="e_title">REU SITE: Research in Consumer Networking Technologies</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This funding renews a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Missouri - Columbia. Undergraduate students will engage in summer research involving a variety of interesting and challenging technical issues in consumer networking. Experienced faculty mentors will lead projects in five major research areas including software defined networking, social media computing, social health networking for eldercare, body-area sensing and emotion recognition, and network performance optimization. The students will participate in the faculty mentors&apos; on-going funded research, investigate technically challenging issues, and develop viable solutions and insights. They will have opportunities to present their research results at various venues at the university, national, and international levels. The site will focus on recruiting students from non-PhD granting institutions with particular emphasis on institutions in and around the state of Missouri.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project rests with the leadership an experienced research group with excellent expertise and experience in the research area. The research activities will lead to a better understanding of the multitude of efficiency, performance, reliability, scalability, and security issues and tradeoffs in emerging consumer networking technologies. The approach of integrating future Internet technologies such as Internet-of-Things and software-defined networking in the REU Site will foster the rapid deployment of advanced consumer networking services and applications that are of significance to the economy and quality of life in areas such as social computing and health care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include providing a unique opportunity for undergraduate students with limited research opportunities to experience research in the interdisciplinary areas of consumer networking. With an already established recruitment network, the project team plans to reach the targeted students and encourage applications from women engineers and under-represented minorities as well as students from predominantly undergraduate institutions. The program should be of great interest to undergraduate students due to its close interaction between daily life and exciting consumer networking technologies. The research experiences offer students insight into the requirements of advanced degrees by closely working with faculty mentors and graduate students, and may lead to students ultimately pursuing advanced degrees and fulfilling careers in science and engineering. The professional evaluation by an external assessment specialist should contribute to educational research on effective structures for involving undergraduates in research.</data>

      <data key="e_title">CPS: Synergy: A Novel Biomechatronic Interface Based on Wearable Dynamic Imaging Sensors</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The problem of controlling biomechatronic systems, such as multiarticulating prosthetic hands, involves unique challenges in the science and engineering of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), requiring integration between computational systems for recognizing human functional activity and intent and controlling prosthetic devices to interact with the physical world. Research on this problem has been limited by the difficulties in noninvasively acquiring robust biosignals that allow intuitive and reliable control of multiple degrees of freedom (DoF). The objective of this research is to investigate a new sensing paradigm based on ultrasonic imaging of dynamic muscle activity. The synergistic research plan will integrate novel imaging technologies, new computational methods for activity recognition and learning, and high-performance embedded computing to enable robust and intuitive control of dexterous prosthetic hands with multiple DoF. The interdisciplinary research team involves collaboration between biomedical engineers, electrical engineers and computer scientists. The specific aims are to: (1) research and develop spatio-temporal image analysis and pattern recognition algorithms to learn and predict different dexterous tasks based on sonographic patterns of muscle activity (2) develop a wearable image-based biosignal sensing system by integrating multiple ultrasound imaging sensors with a low-power heterogeneous multicore embedded processor and (3) perform experiments to evaluate the real-time control of a prosthetic hand.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research methods are broadly applicable to assistive technologies where physical systems, computational frameworks and low-power embedded computing serve to augment human activities or to replace lost functionality. The research will advance CPS science and engineering through integration of portable sensors for image-based sensing of complex adaptive physical phenomena such as dynamic neuromuscular activity, and real-time sophisticated image understanding algorithms to interpret such phenomena running on low-power high performance embedded systems. The technological advances would enable practical wearable image-based biosensing, with applications in healthcare, and the computational methods would be broadly applicable to problems involving activity recognition from spatiotemporal image data, such as surveillance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have societal impacts as well as train students in interdisciplinary methods relevant to CPS. About 1.6 million Americans live with amputations that significantly affect activities of daily living. The proposed project has the long-term potential to significantly improve functionality of upper extremity prostheses, improve quality of life of amputees, and increase the acceptance of prosthetic limbs. This research could also facilitate intelligent assistive devices for more targeted neurorehabilitation of stroke victims. This project will provide immersive interdisciplinary CPS-relevant training for graduate and undergraduate students to integrate computational methods with imaging, processor architectures, human functional activity and artificial devices for solving challenging public health problems. A strong emphasis will be placed on involving undergraduate students in research as part of structured programs at our institution. The research team will involve students with disabilities in research activities by leveraging an ongoing NSF-funded project. Bioengineering training activities will be part of a newly developed undergraduate curriculum and a graduate curriculum under development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The synergistic research plan has been designed to advance CPS science and engineering through the development of new computational methods for dynamic activity recognition and learning from image sequences, development of novel wearable imaging technologies including high-performance embedded computing, and real-time control of a physical system. The specific aims are to: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Research and develop spatio-temporal image analysis and pattern recognition algorithms to learn and predict different dexterous tasks based on sonographic patterns of muscle activity. The first aim has three subtasks designed to collect, analyze and understand image sequences associated with functional tasks. (2) Develop a wearable image-based biosignal sensing system by integrating multiple ultrasound imaging sensors with a low-power heterogeneous multicore embedded processor. The second aim has two subtasks designed to integrate wearable imaging sensors with a real-time computational platform. (3) Perform experiments to evaluate the real-time control of a prosthetic hand. The third aim will integrate the wearable image acquisition system developed in Aim 2, and the image understanding algorithms developed in Aim 1, for real-time evaluation of the control of a prosthetic hand interacting with a virtual reality environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of these</data>

      <data key="e_title">CPS: Synergy: A Novel Biomechatronic Interface Based on Wearable Dynamic Imaging Sensors</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The problem of controlling biomechatronic systems, such as multiarticulating prosthetic hands, involves unique challenges in the science and engineering of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), requiring integration between computational systems for recognizing human functional activity and intent and controlling prosthetic devices to interact with the physical world. Research on this problem has been limited by the difficulties in noninvasively acquiring robust biosignals that allow intuitive and reliable control of multiple degrees of freedom (DoF). The objective of this research is to investigate a new sensing paradigm based on ultrasonic imaging of dynamic muscle activity. The synergistic research plan will integrate novel imaging technologies, new computational methods for activity recognition and learning, and high-performance embedded computing to enable robust and intuitive control of dexterous prosthetic hands with multiple DoF. The interdisciplinary research team involves collaboration between biomedical engineers, electrical engineers and computer scientists. The specific aims are to: (1) research and develop spatio-temporal image analysis and pattern recognition algorithms to learn and predict different dexterous tasks based on sonographic patterns of muscle activity (2) develop a wearable image-based biosignal sensing system by integrating multiple ultrasound imaging sensors with a low-power heterogeneous multicore embedded processor and (3) perform experiments to evaluate the real-time control of a prosthetic hand.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research methods are broadly applicable to assistive technologies where physical systems, computational frameworks and low-power embedded computing serve to augment human activities or to replace lost functionality. The research will advance CPS science and engineering through integration of portable sensors for image-based sensing of complex adaptive physical phenomena such as dynamic neuromuscular activity, and real-time sophisticated image understanding algorithms to interpret such phenomena running on low-power high performance embedded systems. The technological advances would enable practical wearable image-based biosensing, with applications in healthcare, and the computational methods would be broadly applicable to problems involving activity recognition from spatiotemporal image data, such as surveillance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have societal impacts as well as train students in interdisciplinary methods relevant to CPS. About 1.6 million Americans live with amputations that significantly affect activities of daily living. The proposed project has the long-term potential to significantly improve functionality of upper extremity prostheses, improve quality of life of amputees, and increase the acceptance of prosthetic limbs. This research could also facilitate intelligent assistive devices for more targeted neurorehabilitation of stroke victims. This project will provide immersive interdisciplinary CPS-relevant training for graduate and undergraduate students to integrate computational methods with imaging, processor architectures, human functional activity and artificial devices for solving challenging public health problems. A strong emphasis will be placed on involving undergraduate students in research as part of structured programs at our institution. The research team will involve students with disabilities in research activities by leveraging an ongoing NSF-funded project. Bioengineering training activities will be part of a newly developed undergraduate curriculum and a graduate curriculum under development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The synergistic research plan has been designed to advance CPS science and engineering through the development of new computational methods for dynamic activity recognition and learning from image sequences, development of novel wearable imaging technologies including high-performance embedded computing, and real-time control of a physical system. The specific aims are to: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Research and develop spatio-temporal image analysis and pattern recognition algorithms to learn and predict different dexterous tasks based on sonographic patterns of muscle activity. The first aim has three subtasks designed to collect, analyze and understand image sequences associated with functional tasks.

      <data key="e_abstract">One of the most severe and challenging threats to Internet security and privacy is phishing, which uses fake websites to steal users&apos; online identities and sensitive information. Existing studies have evaluated younger users&apos; susceptibility to phishing attacks, but have not paid sufficient attention to elderly users&apos; susceptibility to phishing in realistic environments. As the elderly population in the United States and the world continues to grow rapidly, the elderly Internet user population also continues to grow, and seniors have become very attractive targets for online fraud. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional forms of phishing have been prevalent for over a decade; in contrast, web single sign-on phishing is a more modern strategy, with unique characteristics that make it more profitable, insidious, and harder to detect than traditional phishing. The goal of this project is to systematically compare younger and older computer users&apos; susceptibility to both the traditional and the newly emergent web single sign-on phishing. We build a comprehensive computer testbed that measures phishing susceptibility in a realistic environment. We hypothesize that older adults will differ from younger adults in terms of their susceptibility to both types of phishing, and that this susceptibility can be explained by differences in cognitive abilities, specifically executive functioning and decision-making skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will advance our knowledge on how and why elderly users may fall victim to phishing, and will provide a solid basis for researchers to further design effective mechanisms to protect elderly users against phishing from both technical and cognitive perspectives.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Motivation.&lt;br/&gt;Discrete optimization problems have been studied by both the optimization and computer science communities. This EAGER project proposes to develop new approaches by synthesizing the ideas from the two communities by interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists and optimization specialists in mathematics and engineering. The goal is to develop rigorous and systematic approaches to discrete optimization problems by combining insights and state-of-the-art methods from integer programming (e.g., cutting planes and branch-and-bound) and algorithmic ideas from computer science (including online algorithms and machine learning). To be able to evaluate and compare methods on real-world instances, PIs plan to develop a theory of &quot;natural instances&quot;. This theory starts from the application side, tries to model properties of the instances that arise from that application and then give guarantees for algorithms on such instances. The project plans to incorporate machine learning into algorithms to solve integer programs. PIs propose a systematic development of an algorithmic theory of cutting planes to identify families of instances for which they are provably efficient and to take advantage of the computational benefits of sparse cutting planes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The ideas that are proposed here are novel and intellectually challenging. The notion of natural systems, insofar as known, has not been investigated previously. While machine learning algorithms currently use optimization technology, the reverse has not been systematically studied. Cutting planes are mainly used on an ad-hoc basis. There is no systematic theory regarding problems for which cutting plane algorithms are provably efficient. It is known that sparsity is needed in the linear algebra of cutting plane algorithms, but there is very little known about polyhedra that are defined by only sparse inequalities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. This EAGER project is motivated by a range of optimization problems of high societal impact from transportation and supply chain logistics such as palletizing, package delivery, petro-chemical cargo routing, vehicle and mobile robot routing to energy production and distribution. The ultimate goal is to study algorithmic optimization methods which over the next decade could lead to more than a billion dollars in annual savings in energy production and distribution, a 50% reduction in fuel consumption in supply chains and elimination of energy shortages caused by extreme weather disturbances. This will be possible by the creation of optimization algorithms that are orders of magnitude faster, more robust and capable of dealing with massive and messy data. This EAGER will provide research training for both graduate and postgraduate students and intensive collaboration among multiple EAGERs, and will provide rapid dissemination of the research throughout the relevant communities by hosting a workshop at Georgia Tech.</data>

      <data key="e_title">EAGER: Physical Flow and other Industrial Challenges</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Motivation. At the core of many societal challenges, particularly in view of sustainability and efficiency, there are hard optimization problems. While these underlying problems can be solved for smaller setups using optimization methods, realistic problem sizes are still prohibitive. Apart from the immediate challenges arising from sheer size, in today&apos;s fast-paced and intertwined economies we additionally face the challenge of addressing real-time aspects; otherwise, the obtained solutions might not apply anymore: the problem changed faster than it was solved. This EAGER addresses specific optimization problems arising from societal challenges and will motivate the study of the underlying optimization problems. For this, new methods at the intersection of continuous and discrete optimization as well as machine learning and randomization will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. PIs set out to investigate general solution strategies to address problem size, real-time requirements, as well as uncertainty aspects using recent developments from theoretical computer science and modern optimization theory. At the core of this proposal is the study of real-world challenges related to cargo-vessel routing, palletizing, vehicle and mobile bot routing and related problems. A main difference to classical approaches is that the real-time requirements will not be added on top but will be integral to the whole design process, which is likely to result in better algorithms. Apart from the challenges from the aforementioned problems, PIs intend to develop an online expert system - Ask Minmax. This platform will leverage machine learning techniques to make the theory of optimization methods and tools accessible to industry and other personnel that face challenging optimization problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. A key objective of this proposal is outreach. This EAGER will develop a consulting tool that will allow industry and the broader society to learn about most useful methods in algorithms and optimization. In particular, this tool is geared towards helping the user to make a decision regarding which methods are most likely to be applicable to their problem: in an interactive way the tool will collect information from the user about their optimization problem. The system will then determine the most likely model and provide information. Large-scale challenges in palletizing and routing require the combination of various heuristics and algorithms. A second component that will significantly impact industry is the developing of key performance indicators for such algorithms. These metrics will help to gauge efficiency of a particular heuristic and/or algorithms, which will be important when algorithms are combined within a larger solution. Mentoring and collaborating with a graduate student, a shared postdoctoral student across multiple EAGERs, as well as hosting a workshop in relevant frontier topics at the Institute for Mathematics and Applications (IMA) are all parts of the broader impact of this EAGER.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Motivation. At the core of many societal challenges, particularly in view of sustainability and efficiency, there are hard optimization problems. While these underlying problems can be solved for smaller setups using optimization methods, realistic problem sizes are still prohibitive. Apart from the immediate challenges arising from sheer size, in today&apos;s fast-paced and intertwined economies we additionally face the challenge of addressing real-time aspects; otherwise, the obtained solutions might not apply anymore: the problem changed faster than it was solved. This EAGER addresses specific optimization problems arising from societal challenges and will motivate the study of the underlying optimization problems. For this, new methods at the intersection of continuous and discrete optimization as well as machine learning and randomization will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. PIs set out to investigate general solution strategies to address problem size, real-time requirements, as well as uncertainty aspects using recent developments from theoretical computer science and modern optimization theory. At the core of this proposal is the study of real-world challenges related to cargo-vessel routing, palletizing, vehicle and mobile bot routing and related problems. A main difference to classical approaches is that the real-time requirements will not be added on top but will be integral to the whole design process, which is likely to result in better algorithms. Apart from the challenges from the aforementioned problems, PIs intend to develop an online expert system - Ask Minmax.

      <data key="e_abstract">Authentication is the first step in securing a networked application. Traditional authentication relies on cryptographic algorithms that verify users identify based on certain pre-configured secrets. In a world with &quot;trillions&quot; of mobile objects (&quot;computation in everything&quot;) rigorous key management techniques are difficult, the traceability of pre-configured secrets is compromised, and crypto-based authentication schemes become ineffective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate an alternative approach, referred to as cognitive security, to address this compelling problem. Cognitive security aims to supplement the crypto-based solutions with unique, unforgeable, and robust credentials that are inherent to the network entities such as mobile devices and users. For example, a location claim can be verified by a location &quot;fingerprint&quot; constructed from the ambient radio signals presented at the said location at the said time. A user&apos;s identity can be verified by knowledge the verifier learned from the user&apos;s online social networks. These credentials are physical properties of the mobile devices or knowledge naturally known to the users, which do not have to be pre-configured or remembered. Mechanisms will be developed so that these credentials can be collected or learnt through the normal network operations and be used to securely verify a device or a user&apos;s identity or claims. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an international collaborative project, between US and Japan. The project will involve multiple areas of information technology, including security, wireless communications and networking, and machine learning. Cognitive security is a promising new approach to mobile network security where the security of the device or secrets stored in the device cannot be guaranteed.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project leverages prior work on virtual mobile network technology at NICT and the MobilityFirst future Internet architecture at WINLAB, Rutgers University, to develop a comprehensive services and networking solution for high-performance cyber physical systems that scales to the &quot;trillion object&quot; level targeted by the JUNO program. The aim is to develop a virtual mobile cloud network (vMCN) which provides seamless and low latency services to real-time mobile users and applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major research themes addressed by this project include the design of a new virtual networking framework using NICT&apos;s BYON mobile cloud technology integrated with MobilityFirst&apos;s globally unique identifier (GUID) based protocol stack; design of virtual network services for efficient support of cloud services; exploiting locality to speed up global name resolution; and dynamic migration of cloud services across networks. The project will adopt a top-down application driven methodology to validate and benchmark the performance of the proposed virtual mobile cloud network for a specific advanced CPS application. A proof-of-concept prototype of the proposed vMCN system will be developed using JGN-X and GENI testbeds in Japan and US respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technologies resulting from this project are expected to enable a wide range of commercial and government applications involving real-time cloud services for mobile devices. The project will also provide guidance for the development of future virtual network technologies of increasing interest to the networking and computer industries. The proposed collaboration will also help to strengthen research ties between US and Japan specifically in the field of future Internet architecture.</data>
