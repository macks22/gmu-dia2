Iowa State University CISE Research Instrumentation: High Performance Computing and Application Laboratory This research instrumentation grant enables the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Iowa State University to purchase equipment for developing a high-performance computing and applications laboratory dedicated to supporting research in computer and information science and engineering. The facility will be used for the following research projects funded by the CISE division of the NSF: - Integrated Processor Management Schemes for Parallel Computers, - Utilizing Idle/Spare Capacity Efficiently on a Network of Workstations, - Hardware Multicast Routing Technique for Scalable Parallel Computers, - Design Optimizations for High-Performance Circuits, - Optimizing Synthesis for Periodic Real-Time Applications. The investigators propose to acquire eight workstations and integrate them with the four existing ones (purchased through prior NSF and other funding) to build a cluster of twelve workstations. These workstations will be connected through a high-speed ethernet backbone. The time-consuming simulations that are required for the listed projects can be parallelized and run efficiently on the workstation cluster. Currently, the Computer Engineering program at Iowa State University does not have a computing laboratory dedicated to support graduate research activities. The University and the Department are highly supportive of building such a facility and are committed to the development of the computer engineering research program.</data>

The facility will be used for the following research projects funded by the CISE division of the NSF: - Integrated Processor Management Schemes for Parallel Computers, - Utilizing Idle/Spare Capacity Efficiently on a Network of Workstations, - Hardware Multicast Routing Technique for Scalable Parallel Computers, - Design Optimizations for High-Performance Circuits, - Optimizing Synthesis for Periodic Real-Time Applications. The investigators propose to acquire eight workstations and integrate them with the four existing ones (purchased through prior NSF and other funding) to build a cluster of twelve workstations. These workstations will be connected through a high-speed ethernet backbone. The time-consuming simulations that are required for the listed projects can be parallelized and run efficiently on the workstation cluster. Currently, the Computer Engineering program at Iowa State University does not have a computing laboratory dedicated to support graduate research activities.

The focus of this project is on advancing the state of the art in high-performance computing on the four fronts:- the design of high-performance computers capable of 100 trillion operations per second (i.e. 100 TOPS),- advanced tools for analysis and compilation of programs for execution on machines with multiple processors,- the characterization of applications that require computation rates of 100-1000 TOPS and- the design of a network-based software infrastructure that allows the use of linked computers and linked programs (i.e., metacomputers and metaprograms) through conventional network browsers. The main ideas currently under investigation are being validated through extensive computational experiments and computer simulations. The equipment acquired with the funds provided by this grant provides the computational speed, memory, storage and communication demands of the experimental component of this project which would otherwise not be possible or take unacceptably long times to perform. The experimentation made possible by the availability of a symmetric multiprocessor is essential to the validation of research ideas and results pursued in this project.

The following research is thus enabled:- Architectural techniques to exploit instruction-level-parallelism in shared-memory multiprocessors: Fast simulation methods are the key enabling technology for this research. The proposed multiprocessor enables the development and use of high-performance parallel simulators. - Compilation techniques for High Performance Fortran (HPF): The proposed multiprocessor is a cost-effective platform for HPF compiler development and an important target for evaluating the compiler-generated parallel code. - Runtime techniques to identify and remedy performance bottlenecks in shared-memory programs: The multiprocessor is the desired platform to develop and evaluate the techniques. - Algorithms for wireless and network communication systems: Most such algorithms must meet stringent real-time constraints. The multiprocessor enables the development of parallel algorithms to meet these constraints.- Algorithms for signal and image processing for applications including geophysics, radar, and medical imaging diagnostics: The multiprocessor is needed to test and develop parallel and resource-intensive sequential algorithms on real data sets.

The proposed multiprocessor enables the development and use of high-performance parallel simulators. - Compilation techniques for High Performance Fortran (HPF): The proposed multiprocessor is a cost-effective platform for HPF compiler development and an important target for evaluating the compiler-generated parallel code. - Runtime techniques to identify and remedy performance bottlenecks in shared-memory programs: The multiprocessor is the desired platform to develop and evaluate the techniques. - Algorithms for wireless and network communication systems: Most such algorithms must meet stringent real-time constraints. The multiprocessor enables the development of parallel algorithms to meet these constraints.- Algorithms for signal and image processing for applications including geophysics, radar, and medical imaging diagnostics: The multiprocessor is needed to test and develop parallel and resource-intensive sequential algorithms on real data sets. Overall, the proposed system enables the above research in three critical ways: enables parallelization of applications that cannot be run sequentially, provides a testbed for compiler and tools research, and provides cost-effective resources for sequential but resource-intensive tasks.</data>

Research is being performed in vision-guided robotics, visual learning, organizing and accessing databases of images and modeling and tracking human faces. Key elements of the research include - investigation of systematic methods for automatic learning over multiple tasks including navigation and object recognition, -organization of imagery for fast access using integrated features such as shape, texture, and color, and -modeling and storage of objects for fast recognition and real-time tracking. Advancement in the research projects depends critically on the new instrumentation which will provide the capability to interact in real-time with both sensed images from the environment and images stored in memory. A steerable camera system will be used for experiments in navigation, hand-eye coordination and tracking of hands and faces for gesture recognition. RAID disk memory connected to two powerful workstations will provide for large and fast storage for two simultaneous experiments which may be storing or searching video images or performing real-time model-based tracking.

It is hypothesized that more students, like scientists of old, will be motivated to participate in scientific activities, and in addition the design process will help them develop critical capacities for evaluation. The project promises to provide students with deeper understanding of the relationships between science and technology, and between science and the real world. The project will develop a family of tiny, fully programmable computational devices (crickets) that students can embed in everyday objects. Crickets can control motors and lights, receive information from sensors and communicate with one another via infrared light. The technologies will be evaluated in a range of settings, including work with teachers in classrooms and a vocational-technical school. In addition to testing their hypothesis, the PI&apos;s will evaluate theoretical learning issues of balance between physical and virtual objects, and between &quot;transparent&quot; and &quot;opaque&quot; objects.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">*** This project addresses the integration of speech recognition and natural language processing components in a speech understanding system. Most current speech recognizers use word-level hidden Markov models (HMMs)in conjunction with n-gram language models. Additional flexibility can be achieved by using phones as the basic recognition unit. This research proposes a new technique called a SOHMM Stochastic Observation Hidden Markov Model - for recognizing words from phone candidates. Most current spoken language systems use probabilistic language models to model syntactic and semantic patterns. This project will integrate a SOHMM- based speech recognizer with a Constraint-Dependency Grammar (CDG) parser, which supports the use of lexical, prosodic, syntactic, and semantic knowledge sources in a uniform modular framework, as well as the use of domain- specific constraints. This work will refine the model for the SOHMM-CDG spoken language processing system and address the problem of building and pruning word graphs, which act as the interface between the two components. An experiment will be conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated system for recognizing and parsing utterances in the TIMIT and Resource Management corpora. Sentence accuracy should be significantly improved over what is possible using only statistical language models, especially when domain-specific constraints are used ***.</data>

In addition to the research projects themselves, it is planned to compare the effectiveness of the algorithms and methods on Fibre Channel to that on an ATM network. The project on path following, visualization and steering of liquid crystal calculations involves the development of efficient algorithms to solve large scale liquid crystal problems in a distributed network environment and the tools to visualize and steer the resulting calculations. The project on large scalable parallel quantum Monte Carlo methods involves investigation of communication and load balancing in highly scalable implementations of electronic structure calculations. The algorithms and performance will be compared on high-bandwidth networks and parallel machines. The project on distributed operating systems is designed to enable the effective use of ensembles of workstations. This involves microkernel-based operating systems for networks of heterogeneous machines and heterogeneous distributed scheduling systems for WANs and LANs.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">96-17530 Singh, Jaswinder Ostriker, Jeremiah P Princeton University CISE Research Instrumentation: Applications and Programming Environments for Cache-Coherent Distributed Memory Machines The instrumentation grant will fund a cache-coherent distributed shared memory multiprocessor. The equipment will be used for several research projects in computer science and engineering, including: Parallel Applications and Programming Environments for Computational Astrophysics. 2. Parallel Applications and Programming Environments for Protein Structure Determination.3. Parallel Workloads for System Evaluation, and Their Implications for Software and Hardware Systems. The first interdisciplinary project is focused on developing parallel algorithms and implementations for computational cosmology on this new, important class of architectures, and on developing integrated programming environments-with real user feedback-to facilitate their use. The environments include programming language extensions, run-time systems, and performance feedback tools. The second project, a collaboration with Professors Altman and Levitt at the Stanford University School of Medicine, has a similar focus in a different application domain. The last project includes broadening the SPLASH benchmark suites, the most widely used suite for such systems, into emerging application areas and server workloads. The method of work will be to develop applications and environments locally on this machine, and perform production simulations and scalibility studies on larger machines at NSF supercomputer centers. Local, dedicated access to the equipment is clearly critical to all aspects of the research.</data>

University of Arizona CISE Research Instrumentation: A Robot System for Contour Grinding of Objects with Complex Spatial Forms The award supports the purchase of a robot system consisting of a robot manipulator and its controlling computer system. The equipment will be used for several research projects, including in particular - robotic variable-axis contour grinding, - robotic variable-axis curvilinear feature grinding, - robotic polishing of objects with complex spatial forms, and - programming robots to perform spatially complex tasks using spatial impedance control, an intuitive Euclidean-geometric version of impedance control well suited for compliant motion control of articulated robots interacting with other spatial systems. These projects are all in the more general area of CAD-oriented robot control, where the robot software interface is designed so that it is easier to use spatial geometric information about bodies in the environment available from CAD models. Each of these projects requires a robot with at least six degrees-of-freedom. This research will make it easier to program robots to perform spatially complex tasks involving mechanical interaction with objects in the environment.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9617384 Apon, Amy W. Pickens III, David R. Vanderbilt University CISE Research Instrumentation: Low Cost Parallel Processing Platform An instrumentation grant will fund an assembly of a network of low-cost computers linked by high-speed interconnections. Our low-cost, high-speed network will serve as a test-bed for three projects, which will simultaneously advance research in the application areas and demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of the network as a parallel processing platform. One project will focus on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which indicates areas of the brain that are actively processing information. Current processing techniques can take hours on large data sets. Software will be reimplemented on the parallel system with the goal of reducing processing time so that fMRI is more practical for research into brain function. A second project will focus on data mining, which discovers `meaningful&apos; patterns in data. Data is being amassed at a rate that far exceeds our ability to analyze it. The network will allow parallelism to be exploited for analyzing scientific and industrial data. The third project will focus on techniques such as thread and data placement and communication strategies that improve the performance of parallel applications on the high-speed network. The experimental platform will allow various techniques to be developed and evaluated. Analytic models will be used to generalize the results across comparable architectures.</data>

Students participate in a spring semester research seminar offered at the University and on-line via the WWW to off-campus participants. The seminar covers basic research, writing, and presentation skills, and helps students to select an advisor and design a research project in their advisor&apos;s area of specialty. The participants are selected from area universities and community colleges, including the five Tribally Controlled Community Colleges located in North Dakota. Research areas include neural networks, computer vision, speech recognition, network design and simulation, human-computer interfaces, and application development for remote sensing tasks. Students are able to select from this diverse set of topics for their summer projects. The goal of the project is to provide research experiences and training to undergraduates in computer science, focusing on students from regional institutions where opportunities for research are rare.</data>

The University of Texas at Austin CISE Research Instrumentation: Research on Assistive Intelligence To support several ongoing research projects in computer and information science and engineering, the Departments of Computer Sciences and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin are acquiring a mobile robot configured as an intelligent wheelchair. It consists of a powered wheelchair base augmented with proximity sensors, visual sensors, manipulation capability, speech input and output, and onboard computation. The robot provides a test and application for our Spatial Semantic Hierarchy theory of spatial knowledge in the cognitive map, and for our research on goal-oriented computer vision. It also supports a collaboration between University of Texas researchers and occupational therapists at the Rosedale School in Austin, developing the intelligent wheelchair as assistive technology for people with disabilities such as cerebral palsy. Advances in intelligent robotics serve the assistive technology application by improving the service the wheelchair can provide for its driver. Meanwhile, the presence of an intelligent driver can compensate for limitations of the robot.The results of this research should be important for other application areas where intelligent man-machine systems would be useful, including space telerobotics, manufacturing and construction automation, and intelligent transportation systems.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">96-16969 Roman, Gruia-Catalin Hubbard, P. M. Washington University in St. Louis CISE Research Instrumentation: Effective Visual Presentation of Computer Generated Information The instrumentation grant will fund four SGI graphics workstations connected to a high speed communication network to provide a testbed configuration supporting four projects whose common goal is to enhance the computer&apos;s ability to communicate information in visual form for human consumption. Query -Based Visualization of Distributed Computations- Visualization for Network Management- Practical Computational Geometry- Time Critical Graphics Operations. Query-based visualization is a technique that allows one to explore an executing distributed computation in a totally visual environment. A graphical vocabulary is used to formulate questions about and construct answers regarding the state of the computation. This will lead to a novel perspective on visual debugging and monitoring of distributed software. The network visualization, management, and control project seeks to explore the use of visualization and interactive steering in an environment characterized by high-speed, high-volume data production and a demand for rapid response. The techniques developed in this work will be applicable to a wide range of complex applications that can benefit from human-directed, dynamic adjustment of parameters. Practical computational geometry project deals with the issues of simplicity and robustness in geometric algorithms, seeking a theoretical understanding of fundamental problems in computer graphics, computational biology, and visualization. Finally, time-critical computer graphics is a research effort to develop graphical operations such as rendering and collision detection that adapt to resource limitations with minimal impact on human performance.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">CDA-96-17579 Hamilton, Martin A..Harkin, Gary J. Montana State University - Bozeman CISE Research Instrumentation: Modeling and Image Analysis of Biofilm Systems The instrumentation grant will support a high-powered workstation requested for use in modeling and image analyses of biofilm processes. A biofilm is a gelatinous mass, consisting of microbes and the slime they secrete, attached to a substratum. Many natural and engineered systems involving liquids are profoundly influenced by biofilms. Observations of biofilms are mainly via digitized images from sophisticated microscopes and surface science instruments. It is important to quantify the images and to model biofilm processes. The requested workstation is necessary to support three interrelated, complex computational projects: analyzing biofilm images, simulating transport phenomena in biofilms, and constructing a 3-dimensional cellular automata model of biofilm development. Quantitative image analysis is required to estimate parameters for fundamental biological and physico- chemical mechanisms. Many biofilms contain channels that provide a rudimentary circulatory system around cell clusters. Any realistic model of nutrient concentration profiles and associated microbial growth in the biofilm must account for advective transport in the channels, as well as diffusion. A 3-dimensional model is required to represent key processes such as interactions among microbes, interactions of microbes with the environment, and microbial attachment to and detachment from the biofilm. Cellular automata modeling is the most feasible initial strategy for constructing a plausible 3-dimensional model.</data>

The first will break a robotic control system into groups of behavior producing agents and provide arbitration mechanisms to control the resources used by agents.

The third project will port a software system for research in mathematical morphology (a branch of non-linear image processing) from Unix to NT and incorporate new hue-based morphological image operators recently developed by one of the investigators. The fourth will develop and rigorously evaluate algorithms to detect subtle changes in the morphology of brain structures through the computer analysis of 3D imagery. The fifth project will assist, through computed imagery, neurosurgeons performing tumor resection. All five of the projects are computationally intensive and will make heavy use of computer graphics and image processing (both 2D and 3D). Two of six computers and an embedded Pentium system will be dedicated the first project. One computer each will be used by the other four.

      <data key="e_abstract">9617355 Phatak, Dhananjay S. Gupta, Vipul State University of New York, Binghamton CISE Research Instrumentation: Computation Engines and Mobile Computing Testbed This research instrumentation grant enables research in the following projects: -Fault Tolerance of Feedforward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Synthesis of Robust Nets-Constructive Algorithms to Incrementally Build Feedforward ANNs that Lead to Efficient Hardware Implementations-Novel Number Representations for High Speed and Low Power Arithmetic Circuits- Mobile and High Performance Networking-Network Reconfiguration and Processor Scheduling in Parallel Systems The project supports collaborative research in multiple areas of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The equipment consists of computation engines supporting a small wireless Local Area Network and peripherals. It is envisaged to serve a dual purpose: - providing the computational power and graphical environment required by CPU/memory intensive projects in Neural Networks, Signal Processing, and VLSI CAD, and -providing a test-bed for mobile computing research. Neural net research includes synthesis of fault tolerant networks, and constructive algorithms for efficient hardware implementations. VLSI CAD focuses on low power designs crucial for today&apos;s laptops and portables. Ultrafast algorithms and VLSI architectures are also being developed for real-time arithmetic processing. As the computing paradigm continues to shift from institutional to personal to mobile/ubiquitous, supporting nomadic users becomes an interesting research challenge. The proposed instrumentation supports exploration of mobility supporting protocols, security and privacy for mobile users, specialized protocols for wireless media and adaptive applications. In addition to these state-of-the-art research projects, the proposed setup also enables novel experiments in integrating conventional server functions (CPU/memory/data-storage/retrieval) with mobility support services.</data>

The equipment will be used by five research projects, including - Design and implementation of a load sharing mechanism; - Application of distance-constrained task model to message scheduling; - Design and implementation of a fast restoration mechanism; - Design and implementation of multisensor integration algorithms that take advantage of load sharing and real-time communication schemes; and - Design and implementation of matching and scheduling algorithms, all in distributed heterogeneous environments. All projects are composed of two synergistic parts: development of effective task management schemes, communication protocols, or multisensor integration algorithms based on a rigorous analytical foundation, and their validation with software system building and experiments. The experimentation is essential, since a true evaluation of system performance can only be obtained through implementation and direct measurement.

The equipment will be used by five research projects, including - Design and implementation of a load sharing mechanism; - Application of distance-constrained task model to message scheduling; - Design and implementation of a fast restoration mechanism; - Design and implementation of multisensor integration algorithms that take advantage of load sharing and real-time communication schemes; and - Design and implementation of matching and scheduling algorithms, all in distributed heterogeneous environments. All projects are composed of two synergistic parts: development of effective task management schemes, communication protocols, or multisensor integration algorithms based on a rigorous analytical foundation, and their validation with software system building and experiments. The experimentation is essential, since a true evaluation of system performance can only be obtained through implementation and direct measurement. The research instrumentation allows the construction of an inexpensive distributed real-time environment to conduct the work described.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The majority of current computer speech recognition systems model the speech signal with homogeneous observation frames, represent words by a string of phonemes, and rely heavily on statistical word-based language models to decode the underlying word sequence. This project aims to investigate an alternative approach that incorporates many more levels of linguistic information into a parsimonious hierarchical framework for speech recognition and understanding. This approach will provide new perspectives on incorporating constraints from the distinctive feature, phonetic, phonological, syllabic, morphological, lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels into a probabilistic framework for speech recognition and understanding. Structure sharing of sub-word levels across words will allow for the generalization of phonological effects across similar environments and increased flexibility for dynamic vocabularies and language models. Structure sharing should also produce a more efficient search with a smaller number of parameters. The proposed hierarchical framework also has the potential of serving as a recognition kernel, with the speech signal as input and a set of morpho-phonological units as output. This kernel would have a finite inventory of units for a given language, whose internals will be vocabulary and task independent. To ensure that the proposed framework is language independent, its utility will also be investigated for languages other than English.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">A video sequence is a rich multimodal information source, including speech, text, audio (non-speech portion), color patterns and shapes of imaged objects (reflected in individual frames), and motion of these objects (revealed by changes between frames). Although the human being can quickly interpret the embedded semantic content from the information carried by different modalities, computer understanding of a video sequence is still in a primitive stage. The aim of this project is to develop new theory and techniques for scene segmentation and classification in a video sequence, which is key to video understanding. Research in this arena has in the past several years focused on the use of text, speech and image information. The proposed research explores the use of motion and audio characteristics, which will provide important complimentary information. New results are anticipated both in the general theory of feature analysis and classification, and in practical techniques for video understanding and scene classification. These new developments will have direct applications in information indexing and retrieval in multimedia databases, spotting and tracking of special events in surveillance video, video editing and movie stratification, etc.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project is developing a novel approach to natural language generation, applying it to computer-aided text and speech generation for people with physical disabilities. Many people who cannot speak because of physical disability utilize text-to- speech generators as prosthetic devices. However, users of speech prostheses often have more general loss of motor control, and despite aids such as word prediction, text entry is slow and difficult. For typical users, current speech prostheses have output rates less than a tenth of the speed of normal speech. This prevents natural social conversation, since it completely disrupts the usual processes of turn-taking, and can lead to negative effects on the listener&apos;s attitude to the prosthesis user. The main focus of this research is the investigation of techniques which can improve rates sufficiently for more natural conversation to be possible, without sacrificing flexibility of content. This new approach employs a combination of a wide- coverage grammar, corpus-based word frequency data, and conversational templates. Applied to speech prosthesis, it enables the production of full sentences from minimal user input in a context-sensitive way. The approach can also be applied more generally for efficient production of formulaic text like the structured reports used widely in business and government.</data>

      <data key="e_title">STIMULATE: Modeling and Automatic Labeling of Hidden Word- Level Events in Spontaneous Speech</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Most current NLP techniques expect input resembling read or constrained speech. When applied to spontaneous speech, such techniques encounter two serious difficulties. First, spontaneous speech contains surface phenomena relating to non-propositional aspects of the input, such as disfluencies and discourse markers. Second, spontaneous speech lacks overt punctuation for segmenting the input into meaningful units. For effective NLP, such phenomena should be overtly marked in the input; current speech recognizers, however, produce only a raw sequence of words. The goal of this project is to augment speech recognition models to output word sequences annotated for these phenomena, termed &quot;Hidden Word-Level Events&quot; (HWEs). New models are developed to allow recognition of HWEs to occur in tandem with word recognition. HWE recognition is based on a combination of acoustic and language models, extending the standard components found in current systems. The new models also capture prosodic characteristics of HWEs, including intonation and duration patterns. The prosodic information is combined with statistical language models describing the distribution of HWEs in relation to lexical and syntactic units. Results should significantly enhance our ability to process spontaneous speech automatically; the research will also further our basic understanding of spontaneous speech.</data>

These expanded interface capabilities build on technologies established in related work, and are implemented at multiple user stations in a networked Distributed System for Collaborative Information Processing and Learning (DISCIPLE).

Intelligent agents at each user location fuse the multimodal information inputs and decide actions to be taken in the collaborative environment. Established technologies for region-of-interest sensing, image understanding, face recognition and visual gesture are applied for interaction in the sight domain.

The DISCIPLE environment of multiple collaborating users provides a comprehensive test bed for quantifying human interface designs, and for measuring the synergies that can be won from combinations of simultaneous multimodal communication.

These expanded interface capabilities build on technologies established in related work, and are implemented at multiple user stations in a networked Distributed System for Collaborative Information Processing and Learning (DISCIPLE). The system provides object-oriented groupware running on Internet protocols as well as on an Asynchronous Transfer Mode intracampus network. Intelligent agents at each user location fuse the multimodal information inputs and decide actions to be taken in the collaborative environment. Established technologies for region-of-interest sensing, image understanding, face recognition and visual gesture are applied for interaction in the sight domain. Automatic speech and speaker recognition, speech synthesis, and distant-talking autodirective microphone arrays support the sound dimension. Gesture detection, position sensing, force feedback gloves and multitasking tactile software are employed for touch communication. The DISCIPLE environment of multiple collaborating users provides a comprehensive test bed for quantifying human interface designs, and for measuring the synergies that can be won from combinations of simultaneous multimodal communication. Results of this research will significantly broaden the utility of distributed networked computing for human users.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The main objective of this project is to improve the scalability and effectiveness of knowledge discovery and data mining systems in order to handle large, structural databases (i.e., databases composed of parts and relations among parts). First, a state-of-the-art structural discovery system called Subdue will be integrated with one or more existing non-structural discovery systems. Parallel and distributed versions of both Subdue and the integrated discovery system will then be developed. Distributing both the data and the processing across several machines will afford the most scalability for the discovery systems, and distribution is essential for handling large databases. The integrated discovery system will then be applied to several large scientific databases. The results will be evaluated by domain experts and disseminated along with source code releases of all software to the scientific community. This research addresses a critical need to improve the scalability of existing knowledge discovery and data mining methods, especially in domains with richer data representations, will provide scalable discovery systems to the scientific community, and will increase the state of knowledge in the design of parallel and distributed intelligent systems.</data>

In particular investigations into improving transmitter and receiver antenna diversity and signal processing for interference suppression or multiuser demodulation can now be backed with experimental feedback. Much greater gains in bandwidth efficiencies are potentially achievable by being able to measure and exploit the actual channel characteristics. Additionally the laboratory will be the focus of ongoing research in the area of high power amplifier linearization and very large scale integrated circuit design.

Fitz Steve Bibyk Ohio State University CISE Research Instrumentation: A Physical Layer Radio Communications Laboratory This grant supports instrumentation to enable the following research: -Narrowband Radio Services Design Telecommunications Circuit Design Wideband Radio Design Automated Highway System Communications. This project sets up a physical layer radio research laboratory at the Ohio State University (OSU) which empowers a variety of multidisciplinary research in data communication. The equipment enables the construction and support of a highly flexible testbed for physical layer radio research. This test bed consists of real-time digital signal processors, microwave signal sources, high power linear amplifiers, antennas, radio receivers, data acquisition electronics, workstation and personal computers, and supporting electronic test equipment. The laboratory is the focus of ongoing experimental work in the development of high performance narrowband wireless modems and will spur new experimental work in wideband multiple access radio design. In particular investigations into improving transmitter and receiver antenna diversity and signal processing for interference suppression or multiuser demodulation can now be backed with experimental feedback. Much greater gains in bandwidth efficiencies are potentially achievable by being able to measure and exploit the actual channel characteristics. Additionally the laboratory will be the focus of ongoing research in the area of high power amplifier linearization and very large scale integrated circuit design. Finally much of this work supports a modem being developed for Intelligent Transportation Applications (ITS). The Center for Intelligent Transportation Research is a nationally designated center of excellence for automated highway research (AHS).

      <data key="e_abstract">This project proposes a multi-level process of summarization featuring: (1) integration of knowledge about a document derived with both statistical and symbolic techniques; (2) the use of language generation for reformulating this information into both indicative and informative summaries; (3) summarization across sets of related articles; and (4) development of techniques for domain independent summarization. The proposed research comprises both document analysis and summary generation. Document analysis involves segmenting a document into topics, using statistical techniques to identify key content within each section, and constructing a lexical semantic representation for use by the summary generator. Generation focuses on integration of relevant information from several data sources, on presentation of contrasting information from the input articles, and on the use of planning operators to combine information from the separate representations into a single concise text. The research includes evaluation techniques for measuring both coverage and robustness of the analyzer and generator, including conceptual and linguistic knowledge. Through collaboration with Columbia&apos;s Center for Research on Information Access, the proposed research on dynamically generated, coherent summarization across domains will ultimately be part of a digital library interface that filters documents according to a user&apos;s interests and needs.</data>

These architectures allow multiple threads to be active simultaneously to achieve multiple instruction issue in a single machine cycle. The architectural research focuses on the design of thread execution units that include support for communication between threads, for speculative thread execution, and for thread pipelining. Simulation at the functional and register-transfer levels will be the primary tool for this research. The compiler research focuses on integrating optimization for thread and instruction level parallelism. This research will take place in the context of modifications to the gcc compiler. While threads can be used to allow multiple independent programs to execute concurrently, the primary focus of this project is speeding up the execution of a single program.</data>

It is a follow-on to a successful two year project which deployed caching servers at the five NSF-funded supercomputing centers and at FIX-West. The project resulted in considerable international participation and an early version of caching software called Squid which is now being used at over 400 sites. This follow-on project does the following: ... encourage greater U.S. participation. ... continue Squid code development and maintain the public domain code base for experimentation and collaboration. ... hold at least one workshop to improve exchange of ideas among caching researchers. ... standardize the Internet Caching Protocol (ICP) to assure interoperability between implementations. ... develop an automatic cache discovery system. ... assist in improving the web software, http, to support caching. ... collaborate with other caching research groups to use multicast for distributing data between caches. ... develop specifications for high performance caching hardware, and work with the vendors in developing such equipment. ... investigate research questions such as scaling, recording system performance and information provider hit statistics, and improving statistics gathering to enable better caching simulations.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The instrumentation and measurement of systems is vital for them to be understood, debugged, tuned, refined, tested, validated, or made reliable. This project will investigate the principles and practice of program instrumentation. Principles include a theoretical understanding of the dynamic measurement and observation of various structures in parallel, distributed, and sequential systems, such as acyclic or cyclic graphs for representing parallel executions and families of finite automata for tracking information about variable accesses. The complexity of computing and analyzing such structures will be explored, including tradeoffs between time, space, accuracy, and completeness. The practice of instrumentation implements measurement techniques at a cost acceptable to users, using on-line algorithms to dynamically decide what to do and when it is best done and by fully exploiting the semantics of the problem at hand. Techniques will be developed, especially for debugging and programming tools, for problems whose best-known solutions are currently prohibitive because of instrumentation costs. An arsenal of practical techniques usable in many areas, all of which are based on theoretical underpinnings, will also be developed. This research will result in a deeper understanding of the cost of solving various types of instrumentation problems and an array of techniques for their solution. This project will introduce undergraduates to research by involving them in independent study seminars together with &quot;project sets&quot; partially specified mini-research problems which require as much work in problem formulation as solution. This project will escalate the undergraduate-outreach effort at Brown. The tools this project will produce will be suitable for use by students in their research projects.***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Automated systems that can interact with human users in modalities such as speech and handwriting will greatly enhance productivity and system usability. These systems will allow simple access to information and services on the internet. These capabilities are essential to other tasks, such as enabling access by handicapped users or querying an on-line maintenance manual while performing intricate repairs. A statistical model of language is a crucial component in such systems, which convert between speech or handwriting and text, and in statistical machine translation systems. Most current algorithms for language modeling exhibit an acute myopia, basing their predictions of the next word on only a few immediately preceding words. When humans are faced with a comparable task they easily outperform these models using the richer linguistic information available to them from more complete context. Researchers at CLSP propose to investigate and develop novel language modeling techniques that exploit richer contextual information. They propose to examine models that use a variety of techniques to capture syntactic dependencies through dynamic, hierarchical models of topic, and to combine the resulting models with the best current ones using the maximum entropy principle. This research will focus on improving the recognition accuracy of spontaneous human speech, but beyond that will provide insight into new information sources and techniques applicable to all applications of language modeling.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Automated systems that can interact with human users in modalities such as speech and handwriting will greatly enhance productivity and system usability. These systems will allow simple access to information and services on the internet. These capabilities are essential to other tasks, such as enabling access by handicapped users or querying an on-line maintenance manual while performing intricate repairs. A statistical model of language is a crucial component in such systems, which convert between speech or handwriting and text, and in statistical machine translation systems. Most current algorithms for language modeling exhibit an acute myopia, basing their predictions of the next word on only a few immediately preceding words. When humans are faced with a comparable task they easily outperform these models using the richer linguistic information available to them from more complete context. Researchers at CLSP propose to investigate and develop novel language modeling techniques that exploit richer contextual information. They propose to examine models that use a variety of techniques to capture syntactic dependencies through dynamic, hierarchical models of topic, and to combine the resulting models with the best current ones using the maximum entropy principle. This research will focus on improving the recognition accuracy of spontaneous human speech, but beyond that will provide insight into new information sources and techniques applicable to all applications of language modeling.</data>

      <data key="e_title">GroupLens: Scalable Collaborative Filtering for the Internet</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The Grouplens research project explores collaborative filtering approaches to address information overload for users of Internet information systems. Collaborative filtering is a technology that uses the opinions of some readers of a document to predict the interest of other potential readers in that document. This project builds upon the successful Grouplens collaborative filtering system for Usenet news to explore in more detail the human factors and algorithmic issues of collaborative filtering. This project addresses three fundamental problems in collaborative filtering: how to effectively measure user interest with minimal effort from users, how to use these measures of interest to produce accurate predictions of other user&apos;s interest, and how to integrate non-collaborative and collaborative filtering approaches to create robust filtering environments. The research approach relies upon three experimental methods. A set of controlled experimental trials is used to gather complete ratings datasets to directly measure the effectiveness of collaborative filtering algorithms. A small- scale public trial is used to collect data on the actual usage of the GroupLens system. Survey research is used to obtain user opinions and feedback from both trials.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The primary purpose of this workshop is to create a broad research summary and planning report on the topic of visual cognition to guide research in the interdisciplinary field. Visual cognition integrates visual perception with higher level domain knowledge, and serves as the interface to high-level reasoning, planning, communication, learning, and other cognitive abilities. Many diverse, practical areas, such as automated manufacturing and robotics, mechanical design, transportation planning, education, and the representation and storage of spatial information stand to benefit from research in visual cognition. A fuller understanding of higher-level cognitive processes and their development may hinge on an understanding of their relation to perception. There is already a body of relevant work in computer science on these issues, categorized variously as diagrammatic reasoning, qualitative physical reasoning, geometric reasoning, and the formal logic of spatial reasoning, and there have been other meetings on visual cognition. But the field is of necessity strongly interdisciplinary (the three workshop organizers come from psychology, computer science, and electrical engineering, for example), so this meeting will attempt to be more comprehensive and integrative in nature, in order to accomplish its stated purpose.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The proposed research aims to provide the scientific and technological base for a new paradigm for human-computer interaction, one that enables the principled design of multi- modal dialogue-supporting interfaces. Two strands of previous research support this effort: research towards building novel, collaborative interfaces for automated graphic design and the development of explicit theories of collaboration. The proposed research addresses a key missing element of prior research, an understanding of how theory can be integrated with practice, so that a theoretical understanding of collaborative activity can inform in a principled manner the design of concrete software interfaces. The research comprises three activities: specialization of the general theory of collaboration to provide a framework for the design of collaborative interfaces; application of the theory to human-computer interface design leading to a set of design principles enabling system designers to construct software elements that communicate well in multiple modalities; and implementation of specific collaborative interfaces in a range of domains. The proposed research will contribute to fundamental research in communication, to the development of collaborative human-computer interface systems, and to training of undergraduates, graduate students, and post- doctoral fellows for work in multi-modal communication.</data>

The students participate in a variety of computer science research projects, with emphasis on experimental and applied research. Students are recruited nationally and matched with active faculty members in research areas including: virtual environments, real-time simulation, graphics, computer vision, computational geometry, distributed systems, and artificial intelligence. Substantial effort is placed on recruiting minority students and students from non-research institutions. The program provides a coherent experience involving close interaction between faculty, graduate students, and REU students, hands-on experience with state-of-the-art software and computing facilities, and work on challenging and important research problems.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9617148 Roberts This award provides funds to partially support the five day workshop, &quot;Statistical Physics Methods in Discrete Probability, Combinatorics, and Theoretical Computer Science&quot; to be held March 23-27, 1997 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers working at the interface of statistical physics, probability, combinatorics and theoretical computer science with the intention of developing a common language and recognizing parallels among the fundamental problems being addressed in these disciplines. There will be several introductory lectures surveying some of the major themes of the workshop. In addition, there will be more advanced lectures giving junior and senior researchers opportunities to present recent results. There will be ample time for discussion of open problems.</data>

Penn State University CISE Research Instrumentation: Prototyping Equipment for Application Specific Architectures This research instrumentation grant enables two distinct research projects: - Low Power, High Performance Architecture Design - Massively Parallel, Application Specific Hardware System Design The first project focuses on the design of low power, high performance hardware systems for use in mobile applications. This project includes the design of CAD tools which support the design of low power systems and the study of low power module and processor architecture alternatives. A subset of the designs will be selected for fabrication, using the requested chip fabrication expenses, and evaluation, using a subset of the prototyping support equipment, to validate simulated speed and power consumption measurements. The second project focuses on the design, implementation, and use of massively parallel, application specific hardware systems for signal and image processing applications. A specific example is the MGAP-2 which is a single board coprocessor containing 49,152 fine grain processors (on 32 custom VLSI chips). Experience with the MGAP family of architectures has provided insight into derivative architectures which hold a promise of improved performance, flexibility, and/or physical size. A subset of these derivative designs will be implemented using the requested chip fabrication expenses, prototyping support equipment, and hardware prototyping accessories to validate their benefits.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9610082 Wang, Jing University of California, Riverside REU: Micro-Robot Soccer Playing - A R&amp;D Project for Undergraduate Students This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports 8 students per year in programs carried out during the summers, for three years. The projects involve research and development aspects of micro-mobile robots, robots that can cooperate to &quot;play&quot; soccer against another robot team--an innovative research project promoted internationally by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society. A robot soccer game is played on a court of 140 cm X 90 cm by two teams of autonomous mobile robots, each of which must fit in a 7.5 cm cube. A team consists of 3 to 5 robots. Participants will work on micro-robot structures, computer vision systems, onboard-robot processing units and peripherals, local motion and sensing, inter-robot communication, computer simulation, and game strategies. The program is designed to train students to become research-minded and to think independently while gaining technical and ethical experiences. Students will be exposed to cutting edge research in various technical areas including robotics, artificial intelligence, distributed computing, real-time systems, and computer organization.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project proposes an environment to provide up-to-the-minute briefings on topics of interest, linking the user into an integrated collection of related multimedia documents. On the basis of a user profile or query, the proposed system filters multimedia information to match the user interests and automatically generates a summary of the set of matching documents to provide the user with an overview of the relevant information. The system also provides a representative set of images or video that match user interests as well as hypertext links into the documents themselves. The user can follow up with multimedia queries to refine the search for related images, video, or additional articles. The research has three main components: summarization, multimedia search and manipulation, and event tracking. Results will provide advances in summarization using language generation over information extracted from multiple live sources of news, in multimedia search and classification over compressed images using visual features, and in tracking of events by detecting surface differences between documents. Research will also result in technologies to aid a user in tracking multimedia information in specific news domains, reducing the number of documents end users such as journalists must access.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">*** SRI is investigating the properties of human interactions with a graphical terrain model as they would occur in a crisis situation, with a particular emphasis on elucidating the process of reference through natural language and gesture. First, the research team is augmenting existing theories of discourse salience to account for how entities are introduced through the visual display in addition to speech, and extending theories of reference resolution by incorporating mutually constraining effects of gesturing and properties of linguistic referring expressions. Second, the team is studying how discourse structure is affected by the structure of the terrain model and of the task being executed, and how it can be determined through a combination of speech and gestural cues. Third, they are studying how spatial terms are used in uniquely identifying referents in a terrain model, particularly with respect to perspective- relative relational terms. The data used are generated from a set of wizard-of-oz sessions with an existing multimodal route-planning system. The results of the research are demonstrated in proof-of-concept extensions to this system, and are measured by a systematic set of evaluation methods. This research carries out the first step toward the flexible integration of speech, gesture, and visual display that will be required by the interactive, multimodal systems of the future.***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">*** In the rapidly emerging area of multimedia information systems, effective indexing and retrieval techniques are critically important. In this project, the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) will study algorithms and mechanisms that facilitate the.process of indexing and retrieving images, video, and associated text. Specifically, the CIIR will: 1) Develop techniques for browsing and retrieving images and videos by content. Image indexing is an emerging technology which is poorly understood. New and powerful techniques will be developed for indexing images and videos using visual attributes such as color, texture and &apos;appearance&apos;; 2) Develop techniques for indexing images and videos using text present in the images. Methods of assisting with manual annotation of images will also be studied. The text indexing methods will be combined using the INQUERY probabilistic retrieval engine; 3) Develop and evaluate interactive retrieval and browsing interfaces for image, video, and text retrieval. These interfaces will be based on novel visualization and user interface work done at CIIR. The CIIR will perform user studies to evaluate the appeal and effectiveness of the interfaces. In summary, the project will integrate innovative image matching, sophisticated text retrieval and new query formulation and visualization methods to create a powerful platform for indexing and retrieving images, video, and text.***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Modern higher-order languages such as Scheme and Standard ML provide simple but powerful tools for controlling complexity through abstraction. For twenty years, a major goal for research on these languages has been the development of implementation techniques that bring their performance closer to that of lower level languages. This project will study techniques for optimizing the use of memory in higher- order programming languages, using a combination of theoretical and experimental techniques. Specific activities include: (1) Development of theoretical methods for proving the correctness of storage optimizations in compilers. (2) Proof of correctness of several variations of aggregate update analysis and their associated transformations. (3) Analysis and experimental investigation of new algorithms for generational garbage collection. ***</data>

The objective of the research is to investigate the statistical properties of the vorticity field in two dimensional (2D) turbulence flow. The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in turbulence studies. This is complemented by the French experimental effort in thermodynamics and phase behavior of systems. The collaboration will advance understanding of two dimensional turbulence. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">PI: Anshuman Razdan Scientific visualization provides scientists with tools to model and visually observe three dimensional data. This technique has advanced scientific understanding in numerous scientific fields such as biology, chemistry and engineering. The traditional method of visualization is to model the data into one of the many surface modeling schemes and display the data on a computer screen. This approach has obvious limitations for people that are visually impaired. This project will test a novel way to provide analogous information to these individuals whether they are students, scientists or researchers. Data are modeled in the normal manner, but instead of displaying the model on a computer screen, a three-dimensional wax-based model will be created. The data, after being geometrically modeled, will be converted into a physical model using a Layered Manufacturing (Rapid Prototyping) machine. The tactile model will maintain the appropriate ratios so as not to distort the proportions of the data. A Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM) has been chosen as the test-bed to provide 3D data. A SPM is used to probe objects on a nano scale and its output is inherently three dimensional. The only way to currently observe experiments and data performed on SPM is a visual display on a screen. With the proposed technique, a visually impaired student will be able to feel the surface representation of the 3D data on the physical model as seen on a SPM. The use of 3D physical models for tactile feedback will be developed in three Arizona State University classes: a junior level course in Chemical Engineering, a sophomore level course in Physical Science for in-service and preservice teachers, and a junior level interdisciplinary science course. Activities will be created to demonstrate the viability, importance and success of this project. Workshops will be organized to bring educators, scientists, special education teachers and students to both evaluate and provide input to this project. The project has broad implications for science education for all students because they will be able to touch, feel and observe tangible three- dimensional data models.</data>

      <data key="e_title">PPD: Scientific Visualization Using Tactile Feedback for Visually Impaired Students</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">PI: Anshuman Razdan Scientific visualization provides scientists with tools to model and visually observe three dimensional data. This technique has advanced scientific understanding in numerous scientific fields such as biology, chemistry and engineering. The traditional method of visualization is to model the data into one of the many surface modeling schemes and display the data on a computer screen. This approach has obvious limitations for people that are visually impaired. This project will test a novel way to provide analogous information to these individuals whether they are students, scientists or researchers. Data are modeled in the normal manner, but instead of displaying the model on a computer screen, a three-dimensional wax-based model will be created. The data, after being geometrically modeled, will be converted into a physical model using a Layered Manufacturing (Rapid Prototyping) machine. The tactile model will maintain the appropriate ratios so as not to distort the proportions of the data. A Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM) has been chosen as the test-bed to provide 3D data. A SPM is used to probe objects on a nano scale and its output is inherently three dimensional. The only way to currently observe experiments and data performed on SPM is a visual display on a screen. With the proposed technique, a visually impaired student will be able to feel the surface representation of the 3D data on the physical model as seen on a SPM. The use of 3D physical models for tactile feedback will be developed in three Arizona State University classes: a junior level course in Chemical Engineering, a sophomore level course in Physical Science for in-service and preservice teachers, and a junior level interdisciplinary science course. Activities will be created to demonstrate the viability, importance and success of this project. Workshops will be organized to bring educators, scientists, special education teachers and students to both evaluate and provide input to this project. The project has broad implications for science education for all students because they will be able to touch, feel and observe tangible three- dimensional data models.</data>

The project will provide hands-on learning in the context of a course title Indoor Wireless Project. The course will be taught by the team of PI&apos;s who are actively engaged in research in wireless communications and have significant experience in hardware implementation of communication and digital signal processing systems. The project will carry two credits per semester and will require a two-semester commitment from participants. It will be offered in two sections accommodating a total of 24 students, who will be working in teams of three. Graduate students involved in parallel research efforts will also participate. The overall goal will be to design, implement and test an indoor wireless network for two-way voice communication, data transfers and (eventually) video transmission on an adaptable hardware platform based on programmable digital signal processor chips. The first-year goal will be to implement and test a simplex wireless link between two portables, i.e., one transmitting and the other receiving. For the second year, the goal will be to implement a working wireless network consisting of a base station and four portables in a star configuration. For the third year of the effort, the goal will be to refine the platform to enable simultaneous real-time voice, data and video transfers among the portables, possibly using different system implementations. The project will continue evolving after the third year as a regular course in the electrical engineering curriculum. The Indoor Wireless Project will generate software and written reports which will be electronically disseminated to the academic community. It will also result in the creation of a virtual wireless lab site on the World Wide Web. The effectiveness of the project will be evaluated in terms of the project&apos;s output, the participants&apos; subjective evaluation and long-term career profiles, and the project&apos;s impact on the academic community at large.</data>

The Indoor Wireless Project will generate software and written reports which will be electronically disseminated to the academic community. It will also result in the creation of a virtual wireless lab site on the World Wide Web. The effectiveness of the project will be evaluated in terms of the project&apos;s output, the participants&apos; subjective evaluation and long-term career profiles, and the project&apos;s impact on the academic community at large.</data>

The project will provide hands-on learning in the context of a course title Indoor Wireless Project. The course will be taught by the team of PI&apos;s who are actively engaged in research in wireless communications and have significant experience in hardware implementation of communication and digital signal processing systems. The project will carry two credits per semester and will require a two-semester commitment from participants. It will be offered in two sections accommodating a total of 24 students, who will be working in teams of three. Graduate students involved in parallel research efforts will also participate. The overall goal will be to design, implement and test an indoor wireless network for two-way voice communication, data transfers and (eventually) video transmission on an adaptable hardware platform based on programmable digital signal processor chips. The first-year goal will be to implement and test a simplex wireless link between two portables, i.e., one transmitting and the other receiving. For the second year, the goal will be to implement a working wireless network consisting of a base station and four portables in a star configuration. For the third year of the effort, the goal will be to refine the platform to enable simultaneous real-time voice, data and video transfers among the portables, possibly using different system implementations.

      <data key="e_abstract">One of the most important aspects in learning how to do research is early and detailed discussions on various aspects of the research plan with experienced mentors. Unfortunately, most students get little feedback on their thesis at the initial stages except from their immediate advisors. Attending conferences can be a good way to meet other researchers and discuss work. However, the chances of a student at an early stage of his/her work getting the opportunity to discuss their preliminary ideas with well established researchers are not very good. The Doctoral Consortium (DC) at the American Association for Artificial Intelligence conference was planned as a way to improve this situation. Students about to begin their thesis work are chosen to present their research plans in front of a group of carefully selected faculty panelists. Unlike traditional conference presentations, the bulk of the time in a DC is devoted to discussions between the students and the faculty panelists. Each student is also assigned a faculty mentor who works with the student at a more detailed level. Students learn from both their own presentations as well as watching other students being advised by the faculty panelists. A survey taken after the first DC held last year found all participants (both students and faculty) agreeing that the DC was tremendously useful. We anticipate that all students attending the DC this year (both as presenters as well as those just attending) will leave with renewed confidence in their work, suggestions for improving their thesis plans and a clearer idea of what constitutes good research practice.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">DMS-9631618 Golub The award will permit the creation of a graduate fellowship program in applied and computational mathematics which fully integrates mathematics with a variety of application areas. In particular, students in the program will be expected to actively participate in the experimental laboratory whose results provide the impetus for the mathematical modelling, analysis and computation that the student will engage in. The program will be built upon the existing Program in Scientific Computing and Computational Mathematics (SCCM). The goal of merging applied mathematics with an application area will be achieved in a variety of ways: the student will be jointly advised by two people, one with interests in applied mathematics or numerical analysis, and a second with interest in a specific scientific or engineering discipline; after passing written qualifying exams in applied mathematics and numerical analysis, the student will be integrated into the laboratory of the external input to, as well as evaluation of, the interdisciplinary training can be achieved. The technical area around which the program is organized is that of constitutive modelling for complicated nonlinear phenomena arising in science and engineering. In particular the areas of turbulence modelling, non-Newtonian fluids (such as polymers), the biomechanics of growth, and computational chemistry form the primary areas of application.

      <data key="e_abstract">Packet switching, as exemplified by the Internet and Broadband Integrated Services Digital Networks, has grown to tremendous proportions in the short space of 30 years of research and development. However, many of the concepts in networking and communications were developed in the context of metallic or optical-fiber links to which network nodes are permanently attached. Several of the basic tenets of networking are being challenged by the introduction of wireless links that rely on atmospheric propagation of radio-frequency signals and mobile nodes that are connected to wireless (or even wired) links for only a short period of time. This workshop will identify the major research issues in wireless and mobile communications. The workshop, to be held March 24-16, 1997, will identify major research issues in wireless and mobile communications. By assembling leading researchers in the field the workshop will provide a forum for intense discussion and debate about the essential problems to be solved and about how best to approach these problems. The workshop will feature active participation by researcher with well established contributions in the field. Two basic tracks of researchers are being assembled: 1) communications, link, and hardware technology experts; and 2) networking, middleware, and advanced applications experts. The workshop will consist of joint and two-track sessions, allowing the exchange of ideas among different specialists and focusing discussion among related specialists. A final report of the workshop will be a group-authored report entitled, &quot;Research Priorities in Wireless and Mobile Communications&quot;.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Prerecorded Video Over Packet-Switched Networks</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">In recent years there has been an explosion of research in packetized VBR video, with the great majority of the work addressing live video such as video conference and the broadcast of a sporting event. While this research on live video certainly merits the attention it has received, we feel that the majority of the video carried on high-speed networks will emanate from prerecorded sources. These sources include full-length movies, music video clips, and educational material. From the perspective of the transport network, prerecorded VBR video sources are fundamentally different from live video sources: for live video, the exact dynamics of the VBR traffic are unknown; for prerecorded sources, the traffic is fully known before it is transmitted into the network. Surprisingly, little attention to date has been given to the management of prerecorded video traffic in high-speed networks. There is an emerging type of prerecorded traffic that will likely dominate the broadband residential networks of the future --- Video-on-Demand (VoD) traffic. It is expected that the telecommunication networks of the future will offer a rich variety of VoD services. For example, a costly service would allow the movie to instantaneously begin at the viewers request and would provide full VCR control (pause, rewind, and fast-forward). An inexpensive service would require the viewer to schedule the commencement of the movie minutes or hours in advance and provide no VCR control. This research will develop, analyze and compare a wide variety of end-to-end traffic management schemes for prerecorded video. A central theme of the research is that VoD traffic is prerecorded, and that video providers, networking companies, and equipment manufacturers should fully exploit this important property. Traffic management schemes will be designed which allow varying degrees of VCR control, schemes which guarantee zero cell loss, and schemes which permit infrequent cell loss. Initially, the research wi ll assume that an ATM network transports the video directly between the provider&apos;s server and viewer&apos;s set-top box. But prerecorded traffic management schemes will also be developed for architectures with neighborhood caches and for architectures based on future generations of the Internet. This research will also investigate how the traffic management schemes impact the resource management of the provider&apos;s VoD server, and how VoD services should be priced. The research will lead to a comprehensive methodology for the analysis of prerecorded video over packet-switched networks. This research is described in greater detail on the following Web page: http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ross/nsf/prerecorded.html .</data>

      <data key="e_title">Contact State Space: Automatic Generation, Reasoning, and Search</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">In many robotic manipulation tasks, especially assembly tasks, motion of objects in contact is common and even desired in order to reduce uncertainties. An important tool in dealing with motion in contact is reasoning about contact states, which is the focus of this project. Specifically, this research has two major goals: (1) to investigate proper representation of discrete contact states and state transitions, and (2) to investigate criteria and techniques for automatic planning of contact motions in terms of contact state transitions. The first major research goal responds to the fact that although various ways of representing discrete contact states for polyhedra have been proposed in related research, there is a lack of general and systematic investigation on the best way(s) of defining/representing contact states and state transitions based on certain important criteria, such as (i) how easy it is to describe/represent state transitions, and (ii) how easy it is to distinguish adjacent states. The first criterion is important from the need of automatic generation of contact state space. The second criterion, addressing the granularity of representation, is particularly important from the need of automatic identification of contact states in the presence of uncertainties. The second major research goal is closely related to the first one and is particularly aimed at flexible assembly tasks. In pursuing both goals, theoretical concepts will be validated by experimental implementations and executions. This will result in a fundamental understanding of the physics of the most common assembly tasks and relate this knowledge quantitatively to the planning processes which can perform them in flexible assembly. This collaborative effort is expected to lead to results that will significantly impact the design, evaluation, generation and execution of conta ct-motion plans for automatic assembly in general.</data>

An important tool in dealing with motion in contact is reasoning about contact states, which is the focus of this project. Specifically, this research has two major goals: (1) to investigate proper representation of discrete contact states and state transitions, and (2) to investigate criteria and techniques for automatic planning of contact motions in terms of contact state transitions. The first major research goal responds to the fact that although various ways of representing discrete contact states for polyhedra have been proposed in related research, there is a lack of general and systematic investigation on the best way(s) of defining/representing contact states and state transitions based on certain important criteria, such as (i) how easy it is to describe/represent state transitions, and (ii) how easy it is to distinguish adjacent states. The first criterion is important from the need of automatic generation of contact state space. The second criterion, addressing the granularity of representation, is particularly important from the need of automatic identification of contact states in the presence of uncertainties. The second major research goal is closely related to the first one and is particularly aimed at flexible assembly tasks. In pursuing both goals, theoretical concepts will be validated by experimental implementations and executions. This will result in a fundamental understanding of the physics of the most common assembly tasks and relate this knowledge quantitatively to the planning processes which can perform them in flexible assembly. This collaborative effort is expected to lead to results that will significantly impact the design, evaluation, generation and execution of conta ct-motion plans for automatic assembly in general.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this project is to explore the systems architecture of high-end computers to be built a decade from now. A proposed architecture that combines COMA and NUMA designs is being used to explore architectural, applications, and compiler issues. Tools used in the study include an execution-driven simulator, an address tracer, state of the art parallelizing compiler and database systems, and many workloads. The architectural issues to be explored include organizations that merge COMA and NUMA coherence, new uses for cache tags, and design of coherence protocols. Software issues include address translation and memory management within the operating system for a simple COMA, new uses of the data replication that occurs for share data in COMA, compilation of parallel code for cache-coherent architectures, and compilation of explicit data transfers in parallel code into instructions for prefetching and forwarding of data.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The Virtual Retinal Display (VRD) is a new form of display device developed at the Human Interface Technology Laboratory in Seattle, Washington. This device scans light directly into the eye to create images at the retina. It is anticipated that the VRD will become a ubiquitous display device as it will be miniaturized to wear on a spectacles frame. The VRD is bright, yet safe and uses lasers as highly color saturated sources of light. The research from this proposal will be studies on the fundamentals of light perception of scanned images. These studies will allow us to optimize the scan characteristics for best color, resolution and contrast. We intend to understand the features of temporal and spatial integration by the retinal processing elements of the scanned light and how that integration affects the image perception. We will then be able to produce images with excellent color matching and image sharpness. By optimizing the VRD in this research we will allow its use where image quality is essential, such as in remote surgery, or surgical training. Further, bright, high quality images with the VRD will make it excellent for use in augmented vision applications, where images are superimposed on the real world.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Multi-TAC is a learning system that automatically synthesizes heuristic programs for combinatorial problems, including resource allocation and scheduling problems. This project investigates fundamental research areas that will enable Multi-TAC to be used for computationally challenging problems. The first goal is to develop fast methods for searching the space of algorithms evaluated by Multi-TAC during the synthesis process. In particular, the research focuses on methods for predicting how well an algorithm will perform based on a quick test on an example problem instance. The second goal is to enable Multi-TAC to automatically synthesize very efficient iterative repair algorithms. This involves the development of generic schemas that capture the structure of wide variety of such algorithms. The last goal is to enable users to easily specify new problem domains for Multi-TAC, without needing to worry about how the details of their specification impacts the synthesis process. In particular, the work focuses on techniques for rewriting constraints so that they can be efficiently evaluated. This research project provides an important step towards problem- solving systems that can automatically configure themselves for a particular application.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9619832 The goal of the research is to develop the notion of &quot;staged computation.&quot; Intuitively, the idea is to execute programs and use the results of early computations to optimize later computations. This is accomplished by making use of both partial evaluation and run-time code generation. The research investigates to what extent staged computation can be exploited to improve the adaptability and safety of software while achieving good performance. The focus of the work is the design of an expressive type system for staged computation at the source level, a typed intermediate language within a compiler, and code generation technology to take advantage of explicit computation stages. The starting point for the investigation is the ML language. The proposed research is expected to lead to new compiler technology that will support, in an integrated way, a significantly larger class of optimizations than is currently possible, including both link-time and run-time optimization of code. ***</data>

      <data key="e_title">Computing with Default Logic</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Since its introduction by Reiter in 1980 default logic has been widely studied for its potential as a knowledge representation mechanism. Recent results indicate that default logic not only can serve as a declarative knowledge representation tool but also has the potential to evolve into a practical high-level computational environment. This project develops fast systems for automated default reasoning including implementations for parallel and distributed environments. A systematic methodology of computing with default logic is also under development. Usefulness of default logic as a computational tool is demonstrated through a comprehensive experimentation with default theories describing combinatorial optimization problems. To support this experimentation effort, a tool to automatically generate large families of default theories, logic programs and propositional theories is implemented. Due to the declarative nature of default logic, this new programming tool, based on default logic, will be easy to use, will allow for fast prototyping and will be effective in a wide range of artificial intelligence applications. The testing system will become a standard benchmarking tool for automated reasoning based on default logic and related formalisms.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9619910 Reactive systems such as telecommunications systems, and aircraft navigation systems interact continuously with their environment and are usually safety critical. This has created a demand for a rigorous framework for reasoning about their correctness. Traditional formal methods for ensuring system reliability perform a static analysis where a high-level design is verified using techniques such as theorem proving and model checking. Since actual systems are much more complex than the verified abstraction, static analysis is supplemented by testing and monitoring of the implementation. This project will introduce rigorous paradigms for the monitoring of reactive systems and use them along with static analysis techniques to obtain mathematical guarantees on the correctness of system behaviors. It aims to extend two paradigms --- program checking, which seeks to follow up each computation of a program by a check that proves that the result is correct, and conformance testing, which seeks to determine if an implementation is correct by observing its input-output behavior --- to the context of reactive systems. The project will also explore distributed monitoring of distributed reactive systems. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The University of Illinois at Chicago and its partners, the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA), the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and Ameritech will provide an operational interconnection point at the Ameritech Network Access Point (NAP) that will enable international connectivity and interoperability of the cutting edge US research networks (e.g., vBNS, Internet 2, Next Generation Internet components) and high performance networks of other nations. This project is a key piece of infrastructure for high performance international Internet connections to the vBNS. It will complement the forthcoming NSF solicitation for High Performance International Internet Services (HPIIS), and it will support the G7 Global Information Infrastructure project &quot;Global Interoperability of Broadband Networking&quot; (GIBN) by providing a common interconnection point with staff support and performance monitoring. The Canadian Network for the Advancement of Research, Industry and Education (CANARIE) has already connected to the vBNS through the Ameritech NAP in an initial proof-of-concept test.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Getting leading-edge products to market faster than one&apos;s competition, is a key concern of the Nation&apos;s manufacturing enterprises. Correspondingly, many designers &quot;out there on the Interned&quot; quickly want &quot;one-of-a-kind&quot; mechanical prototypes or small batches of parts, to visualize and experiment with during the early conceptual stages of a new &quot;high-tech&quot; product. This grant will be used to build &quot;an experimental fabrication testbed&quot; for an Internet-accessible, computerized machining service called &quot;CyberCut&quot;. Client- designers will be able to create mechanical components, beginning with a CAD system of their choice, and submit appropriate files to the server at Berkeley for process planning. &quot;CyberCut&quot; will utilize an existing open-architecture, computerized machining tool at Berkeley for fabrication. Rapid tool-path planning, novel fixturing techniques, and sensor-based precision machining techniques will allow the original designer to take delivery of a component with a high-strength and tight-tolerance {e.g., +/- 0.00 inch (0.05mm)}. &quot;CyberCut&quot; will first be used by University collaborators at Carnegie Mellon, Stanford and the MTAMRI at Illinois. There will also be some instances where the design has a complex shape that cannot be prototyped by machining. Other &quot;Solid Free Form&quot; technologies will then need to be evaluated for the downstream prototype realization. A &quot;Manufacturing Analysis Service&quot; will be developed that will evaluate the design for fabrication by Stereolithography or Selective Laser Sintering. Industrial collaborators, Metalcast Engineering and Plynetics will be used for these extended services.</data>

Client- designers will be able to create mechanical components, beginning with a CAD system of their choice, and submit appropriate files to the server at Berkeley for process planning. &quot;CyberCut&quot; will utilize an existing open-architecture, computerized machining tool at Berkeley for fabrication. Rapid tool-path planning, novel fixturing techniques, and sensor-based precision machining techniques will allow the original designer to take delivery of a component with a high-strength and tight-tolerance {e.g., +/- 0.00 inch (0.05mm)}. &quot;CyberCut&quot; will first be used by University collaborators at Carnegie Mellon, Stanford and the MTAMRI at Illinois. There will also be some instances where the design has a complex shape that cannot be prototyped by machining. Other &quot;Solid Free Form&quot; technologies will then need to be evaluated for the downstream prototype realization. A &quot;Manufacturing Analysis Service&quot; will be developed that will evaluate the design for fabrication by Stereolithography or Selective Laser Sintering. Industrial collaborators, Metalcast Engineering and Plynetics will be used for these extended services.</data>

Correspondingly, many designers &quot;out there on the Interned&quot; quickly want &quot;one-of-a-kind&quot; mechanical prototypes or small batches of parts, to visualize and experiment with during the early conceptual stages of a new &quot;high-tech&quot; product. This grant will be used to build &quot;an experimental fabrication testbed&quot; for an Internet-accessible, computerized machining service called &quot;CyberCut&quot;. Client- designers will be able to create mechanical components, beginning with a CAD system of their choice, and submit appropriate files to the server at Berkeley for process planning. &quot;CyberCut&quot; will utilize an existing open-architecture, computerized machining tool at Berkeley for fabrication. Rapid tool-path planning, novel fixturing techniques, and sensor-based precision machining techniques will allow the original designer to take delivery of a component with a high-strength and tight-tolerance {e.g., +/- 0.00 inch (0.05mm)}. &quot;CyberCut&quot; will first be used by University collaborators at Carnegie Mellon, Stanford and the MTAMRI at Illinois. There will also be some instances where the design has a complex shape that cannot be prototyped by machining. Other &quot;Solid Free Form&quot; technologies will then need to be evaluated for the downstream prototype realization. A &quot;Manufacturing Analysis Service&quot; will be developed that will evaluate the design for fabrication by Stereolithography or Selective Laser Sintering. Industrial collaborators, Metalcast Engineering and Plynetics will be used for these extended services.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this project is to provide students and designers with improved access to new layered manufacturing processes including MicroElectro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) technologies. Together, these technologies can facilitate the design of new classes of products that would be difficult, if not impossible, to build with currently available manufacturing techniques. These processes are capable of generating dense, multi-material parts with complex shapes; the size of device features may range over six orders of magnitude; and the range of materials includes metals, plastics and ceramics. This spectrum of integrated additive and subtractive fabrication processes will be linked by SDM And MEMS Unified Exchange Language (SAMUEL) service. The SAMUEL service will provide a common interface and rapid access to two manufacturing processes: SDM and MEMS. Creating the SAMUEL service will demonstrate that designers who are unfamiliar with details of the manufacturing processes can rapidly create physical artifacts and explore new design ideas. Through a standard interface, designers will able to access the SDM and MEMS manufacturing sites and quickly incorporate manufacturing process constraints into their design system. The manufacturing constraints can be expressed as rules for invocation at the design level.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this project is to equip the National Magnetic Resonance Facility at Madison (NMRFAM) 1 with a Customized Desk-top Experiment Management System (CDEMS) that will provide users with adaptable desk-top access to the software and hardware resources of the facility. This project is a joint effort between members of NMRFAM (in the Biochemistry Department) and the ZOO team (in the Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin-Madison); the latter group has developed the tools to be used in constructing the CDEMS. NMRFAM is a shared instrumentation laboratory dedicated to NMR investigations of structure- function relationships in biomolecules. Hardware at NMRFAM includes five high-resolution NMR spectrometers (with proton resonance frequencies between 400 and 750 MHz), a Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) Power Onyx computer system, and a number of SGI workstations, the associated software encompasses a wide variety of commercial and academic software packages used for processing and analyzing NMR data and for retrieving and examining other information available on the systems studied. The proposed desk-top access capabilities will enable NMRFAM to project these assets beyond its walls and to make them freely available to collaborators and other consumers of its technology. The CDEMS will facilitate collaborations of scientists over the Internet and will enable users to interact with NMRFAM staff members in planning and scheduling experiments and in processing and analyzing data. Users, regardless of their physical location, will be able to execute, from their own desk-tops, not only simulations and data analyses, but actual data collection runs. In addition, the CDEMS will be designed to maximize able the efficiency of available computational resources. .</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The Net Scout project is an Internet resource location and technology service oriented primarily to the higher education community. It currently provides four services that are used by thousands of faculty, staff, and students in higher education: the Scout Report, Net Happenings, the Scout Toolkit, and the KIDS Report. The Scout Report is a weekly electronic newsletter summarizing the best new Internet resources of use to higher education. Net Happenings is an electronic service that provides immediate notification of 50-70 Internet announcements each day via a mailing list, a newsgroup, and a Web site. The Scout Toolkit summarizes the best Internet search services and other tools needed by researchers and educators to use the Internet effectively. The KIDS Report is a biweekly newsletter written by students in elementary, middle, and high school classrooms who select and describe the Web sites they find the most interesting and useful. The Net Scout project will continue and expand these services in two ways: First, to provide additional services, including publication of three biweekly Scout Reports produced by specialists in the specific areas of Science and Engineering, Social Sciences, and Business and Economics, and, second, to implement new tools which aid in the location of Internet resources in a specific subject area. A prototype service will be built using as its initial base the three year archive of the highly selective resources that have been included in the Scout Report. Specialized authenticated collections of quality resources at higher education institutions will also be identified and included in the prototype. http://wwwscout.cs.wisc.edu/</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project continues a long-term effort in the area of language learning, a problem of great scientific and applied importance. The same formalisms that are used to describe natural languages such as English are being applied in a wide range of areas from physics to biology enhancing the general applicability of results. A characteristic of these language-like formalisms is that their learning takes place on both a structural syntactic plane and a semantic plane, and these are both integral to the system. Although this research started from first principles in biology, linguistics and computation, intermediate results of practical importance are being produced. The research now seeks to overcome some of the limitations that have been uncovered in the original problem formulation, using a more utilized previously. A new approach to meaning representation involves active components, in combination with the more static visual scenes previously used. If successful, this continuing project will provide the first scientifically coherent theory of human concept formation and language learning that covers the full range of essential issues.</data>

This project also will establish the framework for producing a national Internet profile to record the network&apos;s performance over time.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Rewrite systems are sets of equations used to substitute equals for equals from left-to-right only. They have important applications to programming languages, since they represent a simple and intuitive functional language, and in automated deduction, where they play an important role in improving the efficiency of reasoning about equations. Termination of a system means that the equations cannot be used infinitely often, without reaching a term that does not contain an instance of a left-handed side. Proving termination can be difficult. (It is, of course, undecidable in general.) Under past support, a number of methods for proving termination were devised which have proved useful. New aspects of this subject are now being investigated with an emphasis on semantic methods for structured (hierarchical) systems and extensions of rewriting to handle conditional equalities, associative- commutative functions, higher-order rewriting, and a logic programming style. Since establishing termination is an essential component of many automated deduction and program verification systems, this project will also invest effort in implementations.</data>

Bottlenecks arise due to the protocol stack, operating system and the I/O-network-memory subsystem. It is also necessary to understand how novel applications make use of tight coupling and how mobile applications exploit the capabilities of high speed LANs for their computing needs. This award will help to develop a two-semester course sequence, with appropriate laboratory exercises, that integrates into the curriculum new results relating to the design, implementation and use of high speed LANs. In the traditional computer science and engineering curricula, the requisite information is only partially covered in a number of separate courses, making it difficult to understand the tradeoffs in the systems and applications design. The main thrust in this project will be to abstract out and convey the key concepts, reinforcing them with a series of laboratory exercises that involve the design of key hardware and software systems components that lead to a full working high speed LAN supporting one or more targeted applications. Relevant topic will be gleaned from recent advances in the industry as well as the recent research literature.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">CDA-9700828 Aggarwal, Sudhir Ghose, Kanad Gupta, Vipul Phatak, Dhananjay SUNY-Binghamton CRCD: High Speed Local Area Networks: Systems and Application Technological advances in microelectronics have made it possible to implement low latency and high bandwidth links for local area networks (LANS) but this does not automatically translate into high speed communication at the application level. Bottlenecks arise due to the protocol stack, operating system and the I/O-network-memory subsystem. It is also necessary to understand how novel applications make use of tight coupling and how mobile applications exploit the capabilities of high speed LANs for their computing needs. This award will help to develop a two-semester course sequence, with appropriate laboratory exercises, that integrates into the curriculum new results relating to the design, implementation and use of high speed LANs. In the traditional computer science and engineering curricula, the requisite information is only partially covered in a number of separate courses, making it difficult to understand the tradeoffs in the systems and applications design. The main thrust in this project will be to abstract out and convey the key concepts, reinforcing them with a series of laboratory exercises that involve the design of key hardware and software systems components that lead to a full working high speed LAN supporting one or more targeted applications. Relevant topic will be gleaned from recent advances in the industry as well as the recent research literature.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">EEC-9700702 Abstract The award provides funding to the University of Notre Dame under the direction of Dr. Michael M. Stanisic, for the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, &quot;Vision-Based Control of Dextrous Manipulators in High Precision Tasks.&quot; This project will develop a four-course sequence for upper-level undergraduate and entry-level graduate students at the University of Notre Dame. The sequence will teach students about the design and control of a new class of dextrous manipulators, capable of manufacturing tasks which are prohibitively difficult or costly to achieve with existing technology. The capstone course in the sequence involves students programming a dextrous manipulatory to perform such manufacturing tasks, tasks drawn from an Industrial Advisory Panel, which is a key element of this project. The research aspect of the proposal extends the technologies involved, developing a new type of singularity-free manipulator, as well as extending the calibration-free, vision-based control algorithm to an easily used &quot;point-and-click&quot; means of task programming.</data>

Diane Wey ,Chin-Long Cheng, Betty Michigan State Combined Research-Curriculum Development Program (CRCD) VESL: Visions for Embedded Systems Laboratories The VESL (Vision for Embedded Systems Laboratories) project addresses three needs in undergraduate computer engineering education: (1) providing students with hands-on, real-world experiences in embedded computer system development in an active, collaborative learning environment; (2) increasing accessibility of specialized laboratories to students to allow different learning paces and approaches and to support different contexts and types of interaction; and (3) sharing costly laboratory resources with other universities. The focus for the curriculum development is embedded computing systems. Research results in real-time computing, software engineering, and wireless systems, including such topics as ubiquitous computing, scheduling, monitoring and debugging, codesign, testing, and software prototyping, will be transferred to the instructional domain. Instructional modules will be developed according to the &quot;Open You I&apos;s&quot; paradigm, which views learning as a process of Introduction, Instruction, Illustration, Investigation, and Implementation. Laboratory development will impact introductory courses through senior design project courses via an array of laboratory experiences, including a radio-controlled cars project and industry-sponsored projects. Realistic design experiences will provide students with greater insight about the functionality, reliability, and other properties of an embedded system.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Experimental Evaluation of Software Coherence for Next-Generation Networks</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Efficiently supporting shared memory on top of commodity hardware is one of the greatest challenges to widespread acceptance of parallel computing. Coherence is the central problem: data in a large-scale system must be replicated and kept near to the processors that use them, but changes must be communicated to all of the copies. This research addresses this problem through a distinctive combination of software and low-cost hardware, and through an active integration of &quot;behavior-driven&quot; coherence protocols with compiler-based program analysis. Applications to be studied include collaborative work with researchers in Economics, Biology, Radiology, Genetics, data mining, computer vision, and virtual reality. The hardware base for the research is a cluster of eight multiprocessors (32 processors total) acquired under a collaborative agreement with Digital Equipment Corporation, and connected by DEC&apos;s new Memory Channel network. By directly accessing remote memory, the network allows processors to interact two orders of magnitude faster than they can in comparable systems. Software coherence protocols can exploit this fast communication to maintain directories, implement synchronization, and avoid interrupting the work of remote processors. The ultimate goal of the research is to obtain supercomputer performance for both traditional and emerging applications on networks of commodity machines.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Amortized Analysis for On-Line Learning Algorithms</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The focus of this project is a new family of algorithms that has been recently developed within the Computational Learning Theory community. Algorithms in this family do multiplicative updates to their parameters instead of the usual additive updates characteristic of the standard gradient descent methods. The algorithms from the new family have radically different behavior from the algorithms of the gradient descent family. The new family of algorithms is particularly useful when the input dimension is large and the best parameter setting is ``sparse&apos;&apos; -- having only a few non-zero parameters. In many simple settings, the new family has proven loss bounds that grow only logarithmically in the total number of parameters when the best parameter setting uses only a few parameters, whereas the standard algorithms can easily be forced to have loss proportional to the number of input variables for the same targets. This indicates that the new family of algorithms is likely to be particularly effective in settings where the input dimension is large (such as in Information Retrieval) or where a small number of inputs are expanded to a large number of non-linear basis functions over the original inputs. The goals of the research are to extend the new family of algorithms, quantify the qualitative differences between the new family and existing algorithms, and to demonstrate the practical importance of the new family.***</data>

      <data key="e_title">Memory Prefetching</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Early computers fetched data from memory only after it had been requested by the processor. When memory latency is high, this demand fetch policy also has high latency. Many modern computers prefetch data from the memory before it is requested, which can reduce the latency of memory as long as the prefetching is accurate, and timely. This project is a preliminary investigation of a Markov prefetcher, which uses a Markov model to predict subsequent memory references from earlier references. The prefetcher acts as an interface between on-chip and off-chip caches that predicts multiple references to the memory system and prioritizes their delivery to the processor. Cycle-level simulations show that use of a Markov prefetcher reduces the overall execution stalls due to memory operations by about 54% while also reducing memory usage. This project is extending the initial investigation to provide more realistic analysis of the effectiveness of Markov prefetching, reduce implementation costs, and apply the technique to multiprocessor systems. In addition, new aspects of prefetching are being examined, including prediction of access methods (read or write), prefetching between processors, and prefetching between different levels of the memory hierarchy. The primary research method is cycle-level simulation.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9619831 Query-based visualization is put forth as a novel exploratory approach to understanding distributed computations. The key features of the approach are the use of queries as a device for searching the state space of distributed computations, visual presentation techniques borrowed from program animation, and the ability to navigate through the state space using visual interactions. Query- based visualization treats the state of a running distributed computation as if it were the contents of a distributed database. The user explores this database by issuing queries which are evaluated and the results visualized. A class of queries called persistent enable continuous visual monitoring of the state of a distributed computation. All views correspond to globally consistent snapshots of the computation. The project will produce the first implementation of query-based visualization which will provide a uniform interface for learning about distributed applications that employ the PVM library. In the course of development, contributions will be made to monitoring and snapshot algorithms, graphical representation forms and ways to combine them, and the visual query language. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">With the increasing importance of portable, mobile systems, power consumption has been elevated to be a critical design parameter. Concern over power dissipation is also important for performance-driven designs where power may soon displace chip area as the principal design constraint. This is the motivation for this project, which focuses on the design of low-power, high-performance processors, particularly those customized for use in a mobile environment. Advances are sought in architecture, software, and applications. Activities in the architecture area include the design and characterization of low-power data path functional units, the design of low-power control logic, the design of low- power on-chip caches, and the derivation and quantification of a set of strategies for designing low-power microarchitectures. The software and applications areas will include a study of the effects of compiler optimization techniques, algorithms, and data structures on power consumption of code running on candidate architectures.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The phenomenal growth of the World Wide Web is imposing considerable strain on Internet resources and Web servers, prompting numerous concerns about the Web&apos;s continued viability. The success of high-performance Web servers in alleviating these performance problems is ultimately limited, unless Web services are designed to be inherently scalable. The Commonwealth project aims to design, implement, and evaluate a prototypical architecture and a set of associated protocols for scalable Web services. The Commonwealth architecture for hosting scalable Web services allows scalability through (1) parallel processing on tightly-coupled nodes within a Web site, and (2) load distribution across loosely-coupled Web sites. Commonwealth&apos;s underlying philosophy is to achieve a WEALTH of performance through the use of COMMON components, and to do so along an incremental upgrade path. The Commonwealth protoype will catalyze basic research in four main areas: (1) Data placement (caching, prefetching, and dissemination protocols); (2) Resource management (scheduling, load balancing, and admission control protocols); (3) Networking (routing, packet redirection, and connection migration) and (4) Middleware services (replication and resource discovery). These problems will be addressed with particular attention to the issue of high-variability, which---in previous work by the principal investigators---was shown to pose significant problems for the design of Internet-based systems.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Visibility-Based Motion Planning</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">In many environments the problem arises of generating motion strategies for real and virtual robotic systems with visibility- based sensing capabilities. This last term refers to the ability of a sensor (e.g., a video camera or a range sensor) to detect objects along one or several line-of-sight rays through free space. Both a new conceptual framework and a collection of specific new algorithms are needed to perform motion planning under visibility constraints, in addition to the classical collision avoidance constraints dealt with by previous planners. The output of these algorithms will be motion strategies that integrate motion commands with visibility-based sensing operations. While robotics has extensively studied the motion planling problem for robots operating in fully known environments with little or no sensing ability, and active vision has studied the problem of local camera motion/control in order to acquire needed data, the integration of visibility sensing with motion planning has remained relatively unexplored. Yet a variety of important tasks for a robot can be expressed in the language of visibility. `Plan a tour so as to see all of the region of interest,&apos; `move to the desired location while keeping sight of a target,&apos; `keep a moving target into sight despite view- obstructing mobile objects&apos; are just some examples of such tasks. As visibility-based sensing allows robots to operate in partially unknown environments, these techniques allow on-line planning applicable to dynamic environments. Both manufacturing and medicine can benefit from application of such methods, especially in those operations (e.g., part delivery, assembly, monitoring) that occur in heavily occluded and dynamic work environments.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Research in Large-Scale Integer Programming</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9700285 Nemhauser This research involves the development of solution methods for mixed-integer programming problems. The objective of a mixed-integer programming problem is to maximize a function subject to linear inequality (or equality) constraints and integrality restrictions on some or all of the variables. The goals of the research are to develop new methodology, algorithms, and prototype software for solving this class of programming problems. The research addresses two specific problem domains, stochastic integer programming and set partitioning, which have heretofore not received much attention. The researchers will investigate linear programming-based approximation methods, parallel integer programming, and decomposition techniques as methodologies for obtaining robust solutions to these difficult combinatorial problems. The research results are to be implemented in openly distributed software systems, and will thus be accessible throughout the research community. Mixed-integer programs have broad application in solving problems that arise in logistics and distribution, production planning, aircraft (flight and crew) scheduling, and resource allocation. It is likely that tremendous progress in the size of problems that can be solved and in the time it takes to solve them will come from parallel computing, and thus this research has high potential to improve decision-making in such large-scale systems.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9700285 Nemhauser This research involves the development of solution methods for mixed-integer programming problems. The objective of a mixed-integer programming problem is to maximize a function subject to linear inequality (or equality) constraints and integrality restrictions on some or all of the variables. The goals of the research are to develop new methodology, algorithms, and prototype software for solving this class of programming problems. The research addresses two specific problem domains, stochastic integer programming and set partitioning, which have heretofore not received much attention. The researchers will investigate linear programming-based approximation methods, parallel integer programming, and decomposition techniques as methodologies for obtaining robust solutions to these difficult combinatorial problems. The research results are to be implemented in openly distributed software systems, and will thus be accessible throughout the research community. Mixed-integer programs have broad application in solving problems that arise in logistics and distribution, production planning, aircraft (flight and crew) scheduling, and resource allocation. It is likely that tremendous progress in the size of problems that can be solved and in the time it takes to solve them will come from parallel computing, and thus this research has high potential to improve decision-making in such large-scale systems.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The project will (1) assess the efficiency and effectiveness of investments in information technology (IT); (2) identify the organizational and IT management practices associated with achieving greater value through IT, and (3) disseminate result in academic, business and policy circles. These issues will be addressed at firm, industry, and country levels, based on several large, detailed, longitudinal databases that will be coupled together for more robust analysis than was heretofore possible. The study will include data on IT in five to 15 industry sectors in 50 countries from 1980-95, and on 200 large US firms for the 1990-95 period. Existing databases will be updated annually, and new databases will be built. The study will shed new light on whether, how, and why IT makes a difference in effectiveness and efficiency across a global spectrum of use, helping to clarify our understanding of the well-known &quot;productivity paradox&quot;. It will produce a definitive body of research that uncovers the potential payoffs from IT investment and illuminates the mechanisms by which they can be harnessed.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The research supported under this award will extend the formal negotiation modeling frameworks of game theory---an approach that guarantees stable interactions among self-interested agents---to incorporate richer models of communication, belief revision, and computation. The research investigates models of how communication and belief revision can lead to changes in the preferences that agents use to compute negotiation moves that are rational in a game-theoretic sense. A metric for comparing negotiation protocols will be devised, and optimal protocols will be chosen using this metric. Then, a full strategic analysis of these types of negotiation process will be performed, accompanied by additional formal analysis, implementation studies and experimentation. The practical objective is facilitating the design of software for automated negotiations among both human and artificial agents.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Instruction-level parallel (ILP) processing has been an area of great interest in the computer architecture community and the semiconductor industry. Almost all of the processors developed since the last decade do ILP processing in a major way. Ongoing advances in ILP processing necessitate a careful examination of the amount of parallelism that exists in typical programs under various execution models. The main objective of this research is to investigate the potential of pursuing multiple control flows in ILP processors. The study starts by quantifying the effect of different control flow constraints on available parallelism. Software support for pursuing multiple control flows is then studied. Novel methods to specify control independence and data independence to the hardware are part of this study on software support. This research also studies hardware issues relevant to pursuing multiple control flows, such as tradeoffs between the number of speculative paths and performance using detailed simulation models. Preliminary simulation studies have been conducted to get an idea of the amount of parallelism available with single control flow and multiple control flows. These preliminary results indicate a factor of 2 increase in available parallelism when multiple control flows is pursued instead of a single control flow.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this research is to develop fast mapping tools and architectures for logic emulations that can greatly reduce the mapping time, and thus improve the usefulness of logic emulation, and the speed of logic simulation. Being developed are: 1) technology mapping tools that integrate decomposition and covering, and 2) placement tools that use partitioning methods to do higher- quality global placement. These are designed to improve both the mapping times and resulting quality for FPGA-based implementations. Routing complexity estimators are also being developed to guide algorithm choice. These exploit the mapping time-quality tradeoffs in many techniques. Also being investigated are new FPGA architectures for logic emulators, and systems that can support much faster mapping times, yet still achieve high quality results. These steps are being integrated into a complete mapping-time oriented tool suite for logic emulation which exploits the mapping time/quality tradeoff in these systems.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Optimized codes for multi-dimensional problems such as image processing and fluid dynamics often require the problem space to be traversed in a direction not parallel to any of the basis vectors of the space. Affine transformations of the iteration indices are needed for these oblique traversals. This project is implementing affine transformations for loop retiming in code generators, with consideration of the effect of conditional branches. Architectural support for anticipating conditional branches is also being investigated. With extensive undergraduate participation, research is proceeding toward several goals: identification of new high-level language constructs for describing loop retiming; development of supporting hardware features; new techniques for accomodating conditional branches; and development of simulators and other tools for investigating loop transformations.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9708957 This project will focus on constructing a &quot;smart&quot; programming environment for Java that uses semantic analyses to statically debug, validate, and safely optimize programs. The principal investigators have already developed an early version of such an environment for a dialect of Scheme. A safe implementation prevents the misuse of primitive program operations, such as taking the head of the empty list, through a combination of compile-time analysis, run-time checking, and automatic storage management. Safety, however, is not a panacea: all safe languages defer checking some preconditions until run-time. When a run-time check fails, program execution is aborted. Hence, programmers try to ensure that misapplications are impossible by analyzing what forms of data can appear as input to each primitive operation. Unfortunately, programmers are not very good at this task and frequently make mistakes. The primary goal of the proposed smart programming environment is to prove the run-time checks required for safety never fail. This property, called &quot;total safety,&quot; is a much stronger property than ordinary safety. For any interesting programming language, total safety is undecidable; nevertheless, semantic analyses like set-based analysis can prove many of the preconditions checked at run time never fail. Moreover, for any unproven precondition, an environment can construct program &quot;slices&quot; identifying the execution paths violating the precondition. Given this information, the programmer can decide if the failing paths are feasible and, if so, repair the code. ***</data>

The focus is on problems in which there is full coupling between fluid mechanics and chemical kinetics; such problems are characterized by a multiplicity of phenomena evolving over widely disparate length and time scales. The first technique uses a multi-level wavelet collocation approximation. The multilevel structure of the algorithm facilitates the computational adaptation of the grid refinement according to the temporal evolution of the solution. The rational reduction phase of the compu- tation applies intrinsic low-dimensional manifold (ILDM) theory; those processes occurring on time scales faster than a physically motivated cutoff time scale are allowed to relax to partial equilibrium while the remaining processes are subject to time evolution. In brief, the wavelet decomposition reduces the total number of unknowns and the rational reduction then reduces the dimension of the manifold on which the system of differential equations is solved resulting in a more efficient numerical method. This project considers both general algorithmic development and application to specific combustion problems well characterized by experiment and/or independent theory. This work introduces wavelet techniques into combustion modelling and also has applicability to other large-scale numerical simulations.</data>

      <data key="e_title">COLLABORATIVE: Planning Manipulation with Contact Under Uncertainty</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This research studies robot motion planning for tasks involving rolling and sliding contact with friction (generalized manipulatimn planning). The goal is to derive and use new results in multi-rigid-body mechanics and mathematical programming to develop techniques for the automatic generation of robust feedback control strategies. These strategies will guarantee correct execution of manipulation tasks with contact despite uncertainty in the parameters of the geometric, kinematic, and dynamic models, and sensing errors. When correct task execution cannot be guaranteed, the secondary goal is to specify a set of tighter, but widest possible, bounds on the uncertain parameters and sensing errors, which if satisfied, would guarantee correct execution. Application domains for the expected results include industrial assembly, grasp acquisition and dexterous manipulation, visual serving, medical assembly (e.g., hip replacement), virtual reality, and mechanical design. To test the practicality of the proposed approach and the validity of the underlying mathematical models, a CAD-based, manipulation planning system will be implemented. Automatically generated plans will be executed with real devices (i.e., an industrial robot and a planar dexterous manipulation testbed available at Texas A&amp;M). In addition, real problems and associated data will be provided by colleagues from General Electric, Boeing, and the Amarillo National Resource Center for Plutonium. The work involves a collaboration with Prof. Jong-Shi Pang, of the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the Johns Hopkins University.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Complexity and Optimization Issues in Constraint Query Languages</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project focuses on three problem areas concerning linear constraint query languages. Constraint database systems integrate database technology with constraint solving techniques to deal with applications involving spatial or geographical datasets and arithmetic computations. Linear constraint databases are generally represented by quantifier-free logical formulas over some arithmetical domain such as the real numbers (the real closed field) with addition. Conceptually, constraint queries are evaluated in closed form using quantifier elimination algorithms. The first part of this project aims at developing efficient query evaluation algorithms for linear or dense order constraint queries and syntactic forms for representing constraint databases so that efficient query evaluation becomes possible. The second part aims at showing the complexity of properties of constraint query languages including query containment, equivalence, satisfiability, and disjointness using a new technique based on abstract machines. The third part aims at developing incremental evaluation techniques for recursive (non-first-order) and topological queries. This project will provide complexity results and efficient algorithms as a theoretical foundation for the design of constraint database models, query languages, and systems.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) archives the world&apos;s largest collection of quantitative data for social and behavioral science research and teaching. Complete, well-structured documentation is essential to effective use of these data; today, that documentation must be electronic and must be search-able on the World Wide Web. This award will assist ICPSR to complete a major program of research and development that is intended to produce the next generation of electronic documentation of social and behavioral science data. Employing the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), ICPSR is developing a new methodology for producing structured documentation. This Data Documentation Initiative involves documentation experts from data archives around the world, representatives of U.S. statistical agencies, and experts in SGML. During the term of this award, ICPSR will beta-test this methodology at several locations, develop guidelines and reference manuals, and integrate the SGML methodology with existing methodologies. The product of this effort will be a publicly-available Document Type Definition that may be widely adopted by social science researchers and statistical agencies around the world. It will materially assist researchers in preparing their data for public release and will improve the standard of archived data sets. This award will, in addition, aid ICPSR in producing the electronic text that underlies structured documentation. As much of ICPSR&apos;s archive is currently documented solely by paper records, ICPSR is investing considerable resources in the preparation of electronic documentation, to which NSF is contributing an increment in order to accelerate the conversation of documentation from paper to electronic forms.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Space-Time Processing for Digital Comm: Nonparametric Channel ID &amp; Interference Cancellation &amp; Multichannel Equalizer Design Based on Linear Matrix Inequalities</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">In an urban cellular environment, the data pulses employed in digital communications typically travel through multiple paths from transmitter to receiver due to reflections from buildings and other structures. This multipath propagation causes each pulse to be corrupted by pulses transmitted before and after it; the deleterious effects of this &quot;intersymbol interference&quot; (ISI) necessitate signal processing in the form of an &quot;equalizer&quot;. As a further complications, the projected explosion in the number of cellular users will almost certainly require two users in the same of adjacent cells to occupy the same frequency band. This leads to &quot;co-channel interference&quot; that manifests itself as cross-talk amongst users. The use of antenna arrays, which enables discrimination amongst signals arriving from different directions, offers a means of suppressing co-channel interference. This research focuses on the development of spatiotemporal signal processing schemes to effect both equalization and interference cancellation for mobile narrowband digital communications in an urban cellular environment. The equalizer design problem is reformulated as a convex optimization problem based on linear matrix inequalities and solved numerically. Equalization is effected with sample-spaced taps at each antenna, encompassing a time duration roughly equal to the multipath time delay spread. This facilitates better tracking of time-varying multipath channels as compared to conventional equalization schemes employing symbol-spaced taps. Interference cancellation is effected by forming beams with directions of maximum gain steered towards the desired user&apos;s multipath, and nulls steered towards strong co-channel interferers. This is achieved by processing a short training signal via a novel extended correlator that highly localizes in time the contribution of the desired user&apos;s signal, thereby allowing one to estimate the spatial correlation matrix of the interferers. The equalization an d interference cancellation schemes developed in this research hold the greatest promise in terms of the trade-off amongst convergence rate, computational complexity, robustness to model mismatch, and symbol error performance for Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems where the multipath time delay spread is less than the null-to-null mainlobe of the pulse symbol waveform, as is the case with cellular systems based on the IS-136 TDMA standard.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This research project employs a knowledge-based approach to retrieve medical images by feature and content with spatial and temporal constructs. Selected objects of interest in a medical image (e.g. x-ray, MR image) are segmented, and contours are generated from these objects. Features (e.g., shape, size) and content (e.g., spatial relationships among objects) are extracted and stored in a feature and content database. Knowledge about image features can be expressed as a hierarchical structure called a Type Abstraction Hierarchy (TAH). A knowledge-based semantic image model is developed which consists of four layers (raw data layer, feature and content layer, schema layer, and knowledge layer) to represent the various aspects of an image objects&apos; characteristics. The model provides a mechanism for accessing and processing spatial, evolutionary, and temporal queries. A knowledge-based spatial temporal query language (KSTL) is formed which supports operators for approximate matching via feature and content, conceptual terms, and temporal logic predicates. Further, a visual query language is also developed that accepts point-click-and-drag visual iconic input on the screen that maps into KSTL. The results from this research are applicable to a variety of multimedia information systems.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Knowledge-Based Image Retrieval with Spatial and Temporal Constructs</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This research project employs a knowledge-based approach to retrieve medical images by feature and content with spatial and temporal constructs. Selected objects of interest in a medical image (e.g. x-ray, MR image) are segmented, and contours are generated from these objects. Features (e.g., shape, size) and content (e.g., spatial relationships among objects) are extracted and stored in a feature and content database. Knowledge about image features can be expressed as a hierarchical structure called a Type Abstraction Hierarchy (TAH). A knowledge-based semantic image model is developed which consists of four layers (raw data layer, feature and content layer, schema layer, and knowledge layer) to represent the various aspects of an image objects&apos; characteristics. The model provides a mechanism for accessing and processing spatial, evolutionary, and temporal queries. A knowledge-based spatial temporal query language (KSTL) is formed which supports operators for approximate matching via feature and content, conceptual terms, and temporal logic predicates. Further, a visual query language is also developed that accepts point-click-and-drag visual iconic input on the screen that maps into KSTL. The results from this research are applicable to a variety of multimedia information systems.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Constraint-Based Analysis of Infinite-State Programs</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9619808 The core technology used in this project is called &quot;model checking,&quot; a term embracing a large family of automated analysis methods. To date, these methods have been primarily used in domains like VLSI and protocol verification, i.e., problems which possess an inherent finite-state structure. Model-checking has proved less useful for analyzing general, concurrent programs realized in software, where many basic properties are undecidable. The PIs are developing algorithms to help attack this problem, by combining a variety of techniques used in model-checking, program analysis, constraint-solving and graph theory. The resulting methods guarantee convergence by allowing false negatives; often, these conservative approximations are sufficient to prove the properties under investigation. To date, the tools developed in the project have automatically verified some classical infinite-state programs. Examples are (1) the well known Bakery Algorithm which handles fair mutual-exclusion between multiple processes; and (2) FIFO queuing via circular, N-place buffers, where N is not bounded a priori. The analysis tools proved relevant safety and liveness properties in a matter of seconds; the same properties usually take several hours for advanced students to prove by hand. The PIs are now developing strategies for scaling these results. Methods under investigation are (1) finding more precise approximation techniques, specifically for abstracting path relations as transitive closures of infinite programs; (2) developing compositional strategies to help conquer state-explosion due to concurrency; and (3) unifying the automatic tools with a &quot;proof shell,&quot; to let the user combine automatic verification results into a higher-level, global proof structure. ***</data>

      <data key="e_title">Flexible Automated Software Test Generation Using AI Planning Technology</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9619787 Software testing is a critical part of software development. A new approach to software testing based on AI Planning is investigated. The similarity of plans to test cases for some systems (e.g., command language and transaction based systems) makes the representation well suited for test generation. The representation encourages testers to think at a higher level when designing tests. To exploit these potential advantages, an automated test generator is constructed with an AI planning system at its core. This generator allows representation of testing goals and testing criteria to support a variety of testing tasks. The project&apos;s contribution to Software Testing is to extend how testing goals are articulated. Its contribution to AI planning is developing new search strategies for efficient planning, and determining how to generate goals that conform to tester&apos;s intent, and evaluating the efficacy of using AI planners during software testing. Tasks include 1) improve planning efficiency for generating large tests; 2) include representation of test focus and various test criteria to make the approach flexible; 3) represent high level testing goals to reduce tedium for testers; 4) evaluate the efficacy of the new approach to identify strengths and weaknesses of using AI Planning for testing. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project is investigating applications of dihedral sequence comparison (DISCO) to protein structure comparison and protein folding problems. DISCO transforms atomic coordinates into one-dimensional dihedral sequences, then applies the BioSCAN sequence alignment computer to find segments with similar three-dimensional folds. The goals of the DISCO project include: (1) exploring new algorithms and representations of the three-dimensional structures of folded proteins by one-dimensional sequences; (2) exploring the use of the BioSCAN system to compare these sequences; (3) developing statistically-based scores for measuring the structural similarity of folded protein segments by comparing their dihedral sequences; (4) developing a robust computational system based on BioSCAN for protein structure analysis; and (5) making the DISCO system available over the Internet to the scientific community.</data>

      <data key="e_title">COLLABORATIVE: Planning Manipulation with Contact Under Uncertainty</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This research studies robot motion planning for tasks involving rolling and sliding contact with friction (generalized manipulation planning). The goal is to derive and use new results in multi-rigid-body mechanics and mathematical programming to develop techniques for the automatic generation of robust feedback control strategies. These strategies will guarantee correct execution of manipulation tasks with contact despite uncertainty in the parameters of the geometric, kinematic, and dynamic models, and sensing errors. When correct task execution cannot be guaranteed, the secondary goal is to specify a set of tighter, but widest possible, bounds on the uncertain parameters and sensing errors, which if satisfied, would guarantee correct execution. Application domains for the expected results include industrial assembly, grasp acquisition and dexterous manipulation, visual serving, medical assembly (e.g., hip replacement), virtual reality, and mechanical design. To test the practicality of the proposed approach and the validity of the underlying mathematical models, a CAD-based, manipulation planning system will be implemented. Automatically generated plans will be executed with real devices (i.e., an industrial robot and a planar dexterous manipulation testbed available at Texas A&amp;M). In addition, real problems and associated data will be provided by colleagues from General Electric, Boeing, and the Amarillo National Resource Center for Plutonium. The work involves a collaboration with Profs. Nancy Amato and Jeffrey Trinkle of the Department of Computer Science at Texas A&amp;M University.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Invitational Workshop on Information Retrieval Tools</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Information Retrieval (IR) research involves computer programs to organize, classify, retrieve, evaluate, and display databases and search results. The IR field has a long history of rigorous evaluation in narrowly defined test environments. However, the current trend is toward more realistic test environments with larger databases, more sophisticated search engines, and evaluation of the human-system contribution to the search process. The focus of this workshop is to begin development of a toolkit of programs, environments, and tasks to be made widely available to researchers. The goal of the toolkit is to provide a more uniform basis for comparison of research by different groups and under different circumstances. Workshop presentations are devoted to identifying the available tools, their limitations, and the needs of current and future research. Reports from smaller working groups are to be integrated into a plan that will guide toolkit development in the near future. Furter information about the workshop and the workshop reports is available at &lt;http://www.pitt.edu/~korfhage/ir-tools.html&gt;.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Software Evolution and Interleaving</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9708913 Complex, evolved software is constructed from a tight-knit composition of computational structures, called strands, each of which is responsible for achieving some requirement, goal, or subset of system functionality. Program strands are interwoven and sometimes even merged in order to share resources. This phenomenon is called interleaving, and understanding how interleaved strands compose is the purpose of the proposed work. There are two key objectives to the research: to formulate a rigorous characterization of the compositional relationships among interleaved strands and to design a new representation for expressing their composition. To form a rigorous characterization, a case study of an existing corpus of software will be performed in which interleaving of design patterns will be investigated and compositional mechanisms will be classified. Existing formalisms for representing strands and their relationships will be surveyed and extended to create a new formalism that expresses strand composition. The understanding gained will suggest what types of documentation, programming language features, and design abstractions are needed to enable software engineers to make interleaving decisions explicit. This will alert future maintainers of interleaved software to the fact that the interleaving was intentionally introduced and mitigate problems with understanding it. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The objective of this project is to deploy the latest advances in concurrency research and in logic programming systems to build a software environment called LMC for system specification and verification. LMC&apos;s main function is model checking: determining whether a software system possesses a particular formally specified property. LMC is built from two independently developed systems, each of significant interest in its own domain: the Concurrency Factory verification toolkit (developed jointly by Stony Brook and NC State), and the XSB tabled logic programming system (developed by Stony Brook). The anticipated benefits of this research include the following: a model checker in XSB is specified at the level of semantic equations, meaning a system for a specific specification language and logic can be coded in several hundred lines of XSB code rather than in tens of thousands of lines of C++ code; the programmability of XSB allows for direct encoding of important model checking optimizations; in XSB it is possible to interleave arbitrarily model checking computational steps with deduction steps without penalizing the performance of the former. These features are expected to make LMC a practical tool for formally assuring the correctness of critical software systems such as network protocols.</data>

These features are expected to make LMC a practical tool for formally assuring the correctness of critical software systems such as network protocols.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Software tools are defined as abstract tools that can be programmed to vector field systems to perform a desired task, such as centering, rotating and filtering field configurations. Hardware tools are defined as generic objects that can interact with other objects being manipulated by the vector field system, in manners that are suitable for mechanical assembly operations. Examples of hardware tools include grippers, sliders, compliant fixtures, etc. These tools can be viewed as basic building blocks of micro-assembly manipulation tasks, that together define an API for the development and specification of micro manipulation strategies in a modular way, using a &quot;high level language&quot;. This research will investigate utility tools on both sensorles and sensor-based frameworks. Path planning in a compliant accommodating vector force field system will also be investigated.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project investigates combined visual and haptic (touch) interfaces to display multi-dimensional data generated by computer models of physical systems. The focus is on data features that are difficult to convey visually, such as scalar data which fills volumes, vector fields, and tensor fields. First, tests are conducted to better understand the perception of haptic rendering elements: virtual surfaces and constraints, forces and torques, and mechanical impedances. Second, new haptic rendering modes are developed which can convey multi- dimensional data via combinations of haptic rendering elements. These modes are tested using representative visualization problems in fluid dynamics, electromagnetics, and solid mechanics. Third, visualization puzzles are developed which quantify the perceptual added value of haptic rendering modes. Both cooperative and complementary visual/haptic rendering are explored. The project seeks to discover synergistic rendering modes which produce understanding more easily than visual rendering alone. An improved visual/haptic interface enables intuitive debugging of computer models, efficient visualization of modeling results, and improved physical understanding. Such a capability benefits the conduct of scientific research in many fields, the design and analysis of engineered systems, and the education of future scientists and engineers.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Reduced-Rank Adaptive Filtering for Spread Spectrum Communications, Array Processing and Detection</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This research develops new fast adaptive filtering algorithms and structures, which are characterized by a low computational complexity, and is applying them to a broad class of applications, including modern communications systems and advanced sensor array processing. For the communications application, this study demonstrates that such adaptive signal processing can effectively mitigate interference in satellite and terrestrial CDMA spread spectrum wireless communications as well as provide cross-talk cancellation in dense WDM fiberoptic links. The benefits of this new technology include power savings and increased data throughput, leading to newer generations of receiver processing hardware that are being developed from this study. In the sensor array processing application, it is demonstrated that low-complexity, reduced-dimension adaptive CFAR detectors are capable of outperforming all existing detectors for modern radar systems. The technology developed from this research permits space-time adaptive processing on platforms which are limited in terms of size, weight and power; such as airborne and space-segment surveillance systems. The key underlying innovation in all of these applications is the use of transform domain adaptive signal processing utilizing the cross-spectral metric and low-complexity filtering structures. This metric permits a lower-order adaptive filter to converge to a solution which is either identical or very close to the optimal solution. Since this filter has a smaller number of adaptive weights, it converges faster and requires a lower computational complexity. This new technology represents a generalization of multiresolution and time-frequency basis representations. The full-dimensional transform domain representation (realized using a filterbank, DFT/DCT, or wavelet) is then compressed to keep only the most important information as selected by the cross-spectral metric.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">CDA-9703228 Prithviraj Banerjee Northwestern University A Distributed High-Performance Computing Infrastructure This award is for the acquisition of 20 high-end UNIX workstations, 50 low-end UNIX workstations, three UNIX fileservers, an 8-processor distributed shared memory multiprocessor, and a 64-ported ATM switching hub. The machines would be networked together using high-speed OC-3 ATM networks with bandwidths of 155 Mbps. As the use of high-speed networking moves from the laboratory to the workplace, new opportunities arise for the design and implementation of a high-speed distributed computing environment. The goals of this project are: (1) to explore the use of high-speed networking and computing to investigate file systems and data management issues for high-performance distributed computing, (2) to investigate the parallel programming support of networks of high-speed workstations and personal computers as an alternative to stand-alone parallel computers, (3) to study high-performance computer-aided design of electronic systems in a heterogeneous environment, and to develop a Web-based CAD computing center, that takes advantage of high-speed networking, (4) to explore new instructional techniques that take advantage of the high bandwidth and high speed.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">CDA-9703228 Prithviraj Banerjee Northwestern University A Distributed High-Performance Computing Infrastructure This award is for the acquisition of 20 high-end UNIX workstations, 50 low-end UNIX workstations, three UNIX fileservers, an 8-processor distributed shared memory multiprocessor, and a 64-ported ATM switching hub. The machines would be networked together using high-speed OC-3 ATM networks with bandwidths of 155 Mbps. As the use of high-speed networking moves from the laboratory to the workplace, new opportunities arise for the design and implementation of a high-speed distributed computing environment. The goals of this project are: (1) to explore the use of high-speed networking and computing to investigate file systems and data management issues for high-performance distributed computing, (2) to investigate the parallel programming support of networks of high-speed workstations and personal computers as an alternative to stand-alone parallel computers, (3) to study high-performance computer-aided design of electronic systems in a heterogeneous environment, and to develop a Web-based CAD computing center, that takes advantage of high-speed networking, (4) to explore new instructional techniques that take advantage of the high bandwidth and high speed.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">CDA-9703217 Grupen, Roderic A. University of Massachusetts A Facility for Cross Disciplinary Research on Sensorimotor Development in Humans and Machines This award is for supporting research activities in Computer Science and Psychology at UMass in assembling an infrastructure for experimental work on the development of conceptual structure from sensorimotor activity. An interactionist theory is advanced in which the origin of knowledge is interactive behavior in an environment. By this account, the nature of the environment and the agent&apos;s native resources (sensors, effectors, and control) lead directly to appropriate conceptual structures in natural and artificial systems. The central claim of this research is that the first task facing an intelligent, embodied agent is coordinated sensory and motor interaction with its environment and that this task leads to policies and abstractions that influence the subsequent acquisition of higher cognitive abilities. An interdisciplinary team specializing in robotics, cognitive development, and motor development, learning, planning and language lead the effort. The infrastructure incorporates robot hands and arms, binocular vision, binaural audition, haptic and kinesthetic information in a common framework to provide a rich sensory and motor encoding of interaction with the world. In addition to the robotics facilities, the infrastructure includes tools for gathering precise, quantitative observations of postures and rates of movement in human subjects. These facilities are designed to support analogs of nontrivial human processes so that computational models of development may be compared to data from infant subjects.</data>

The infrastructure incorporates robot hands and arms, binocular vision, binaural audition, haptic and kinesthetic information in a common framework to provide a rich sensory and motor encoding of interaction with the world. In addition to the robotics facilities, the infrastructure includes tools for gathering precise, quantitative observations of postures and rates of movement in human subjects. These facilities are designed to support analogs of nontrivial human processes so that computational models of development may be compared to data from infant subjects.</data>

To achieve this goal Cornell researchers plan to: (1) do fundamental new research, (2) develop integrated systems to demonstrate the power of their results, and (3) test these systems. In order to develop the proposed systems, it is critical to test them with real systems and real users. These researchers plan to use their teaching activities as a ready source of users to test their systems, as well as using the systems to disseminate their research results and to provide experimental information services. Cornell University is moving towards a campus-wide hybrid ATM and switched ethernet communications network, which will eventually enable them to test their systems with campus-wide network of 20,000 users.

This infrastructure will be used primarily as follows: The Center for Geometric Computation will be developing an interactive interface for geometric computation over the internet which will be used by the participating research laboratories and made available to other laboratories; the Computer Graphics Laboratory will focus on interactive visualization of large and complex geometric environments which also includes efficient utilization of network and distribute computing resources; the Computer Vision Laboratory is working on computational techniques for the visualization of the differential geometry of surfaces, visualizing and matching of signatures for Automatic Target Recognition, and real-time image understanding techniques for medical imaging; The Computer Integrated Surgery Laboratory will be conducting a number of projects in medical robotics including the development of techniques for minimally invasive surgery using navigation and guidance during neurosurgery and lung surgery, and, image and model registration techniques that use various 2D imaging modalities. The Natural Language Processing Laboratory will be studying document-space visualization in a high-dimensional space for information retrieval as well as clustering algorithms for high-dimensional word and document spaces.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">CDA-9703080 Wolf, Lawrence Johns Hopkins University A Networked Computing Environment for the Manipulation and Visualization of Geometric Data This award is for the acquisition of an infrastructure for geometric computing providing a unified environment for five research laboratories in the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University (and one researcher at Brown University) having a large commonality in interests. This infrastructure will be used primarily as follows: The Center for Geometric Computation will be developing an interactive interface for geometric computation over the internet which will be used by the participating research laboratories and made available to other laboratories; the Computer Graphics Laboratory will focus on interactive visualization of large and complex geometric environments which also includes efficient utilization of network and distribute computing resources; the Computer Vision Laboratory is working on computational techniques for the visualization of the differential geometry of surfaces, visualizing and matching of signatures for Automatic Target Recognition, and real-time image understanding techniques for medical imaging; The Computer Integrated Surgery Laboratory will be conducting a number of projects in medical robotics including the development of techniques for minimally invasive surgery using navigation and guidance during neurosurgery and lung surgery, and, image and model registration techniques that use various 2D imaging modalities. The Natural Language Processing Laboratory will be studying document-space visualization in a high-dimensional space for information retrieval as well as clustering algorithms for high-dimensional word and document spaces.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Design and Rapid Prototyping of Customized Micro and Macro Compliant Mechanisms</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project focuses on design and fabrication for a novel class of mechanical system known as compliant mechanisms. Compliant devices replace elements traditionally assembled using joints and springs with compliant flexible members that use elastic deformations to transmit motions and forces. This allows the research to concentrate more on representation, translation, and interface issues of design and fabrication, and less on issues such as assemble and manufacturability. The domain of compliant mechanisms allows design and optimization to be performed on devices at both the macro and micro level (e.g., SFF and MEMS-type fabrication processes, respectively), and so will afford a unique opportunity to study the clean separation of design and fabrication analogous to the VLSI paradigm. This research targets three primary areas of compliant mechanism design and fabrication. Fundamental to this study is the optimal synthesis of compliant devices, both macro and micro. This includes the design and analysis of 3-D structures and the nonlinearities associated with large deformations. The ability to form more complex objects based on a library of standardized parametric components will also be explored. As the processes are generally not the same, the issue of designing and refining translation tools to move between representations is a critical component in this research. The choice of intermediate representations will be critically examined, and the appropriate translation tools will be developed. The goal here will be to push towards intermediate formats that are suitable to multiple fabrication processes, at both the micro and macro scales. Finally, the ability to test and refine designs for micro structures by the use of macro prototypes fabricated from the same initial model will be developed, and its utility in the design of MEMS devices will be carefully examined.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Design and Rapid Prototyping of Customized Micro and Macro Compliant Mechanisms</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project focuses on design and fabrication for a novel class of mechanical system known as compliant mechanisms. Compliant devices replace elements traditionally assembled using joints and springs with compliant flexible members that use elastic deformations to transmit motions and forces. This allows the research to concentrate more on representation, translation, and interface issues of design and fabrication, and less on issues such as assemble and manufacturability. The domain of compliant mechanisms allows design and optimization to be performed on devices at both the macro and micro level (e.g., SFF and MEMS-type fabrication processes, respectively), and so will afford a unique opportunity to study the clean separation of design and fabrication analogous to the VLSI paradigm. This research targets three primary areas of compliant mechanism design and fabrication. Fundamental to this study is the optimal synthesis of compliant devices, both macro and micro. This includes the design and analysis of 3-D structures and the nonlinearities associated with large deformations. The ability to form more complex objects based on a library of standardized parametric components will also be explored. As the processes are generally not the same, the issue of designing and refining translation tools to move between representations is a critical component in this research. The choice of intermediate representations will be critically examined, and the appropriate translation tools will be developed. The goal here will be to push towards intermediate formats that are suitable to multiple fabrication processes, at both the micro and macro scales. Finally, the ability to test and refine designs for micro structures by the use of macro prototypes fabricated from the same initial model will be developed, and its utility in the design of MEMS devices will be carefully examined.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This research is on techniques to support early system-level exploration of memory-intensive behaviors for multimedia applications such as video and image processing. In addition to memory, system performance, power consumption and total cost are constraints being considered. Techniques and tools being developed under this approach are for: (1) estimation of memory requirements from the system&apos;s specification under resource, performance and power constraints, enabling a tradeoff of computation time against estimation accuracy by system designers; (2) optimization of the embedded system&apos;s specification under area, performance and power constraints using a combination of coarse-grain and fine-grain transformations; and (3) partitioning, organization, and mapping of memory structures, including arrays, records and pointers, for implementation of the system specification into hardware and software. These techniques and tools are being integrated into an exploration environment which permits system designers to evaluate feasible hardware/software implementations of memory-intensive embedded applications.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project is studying software development methods to develop general techniques that can be used to parameterize specific instances of these methods into general methods. These general methods will be evaluated in a series of experiments in order to develop an experience base of such knowledge. Software development in the future will be based upon reuse of existing products in a variety of forms. This work provides insight into the relationships between reading and writing, analysis and construction. The research focuses on: 1. Developing families of techniques based upon understanding the various documents used in a software development in order to (a) evaluate the document itself, e.g., to report defects in the document, and (b) construct other documents using an original document as a baseline, e.g., to develop a new product based upon reuse of prior products using the earlier documentation as a guide to the new development. 2. Developing a set of evaluation methods that can be used to assess technologies in the laboratory and in industrial settings. 3. Building an Experience Base of technique evaluations that can be accessed by others, who can append their own experiences with those techniques.</data>

Organizational informatics is viewed as a subarea of social informatics. Findings and theories belong to organizational informatics when they can be characterized in terms of the participants of organizations. Using this criterion scholarOs and researchers understandings of the adoption, use, and impacts of groupware fall well within organizational informatics. In contrast, the Internet is used by millions of people outside of their worklives, and the character and consequences of the public&apos;s use of the Internet is a topic outside of organizational informatics, but within social informatics.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Rapid expansion of wireless communication services during the last decade is expected to continue at an even faster pace in the future. This growth creates a demand for novel modulation, coding, and detection methods suitable for the rapidly varying multipath fading channels encountered in mobile radio. We propose to investigate a new approach to the estimation and prediction of the fading channel which does not rely on statistical characterization. In this method, the physical nature of the flat fading signal is exploited to yield a deterministic model that predicts the channel for an entire block of data. Specifically, the mobile radio signal is decomposed into several scattered components distinguished by their Doppler shifts; the slowly varying parameters associated with these components are determined and tracked, and the composite fading signal is predicted. This approach may potentially result in the ability to anticipate and compensate for the &quot;deep fades that severely limit the performance of wireless communication systems and will aid in the development of low-power mobile radio systems.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Coleman 9704509 The investigator and his colleagues focus on the efficient numerical computation of global solutions of problems of nonlinear elastostatics in a high-performance computational environment. Particular attention is paid to the global post-critical behavior of symmetric imperfection-free elastic shell structures --- the analysis of which has great significance in understanding the large deformation response and ultimate collapse scenario of realistic engineering structures. A major theme of the work is to exploit the natural parallelism, via group theoretic techniques, in an important class of engineering problems characterized by underlying symmetries. They also investigate the use of automatic differentiation software in the context of those problems. Finally, they study the effectiveness of symmetry-motivated preconditioners, within the context of Krylov iterative subspace methods, for a class of ``almost-symmetric&apos;&apos; problems in structural mechanics. Due to their high strength-to-weight ratios, thin shell structures have been used extensively in aerospace, civil, mechanical and nuclear engineering applications, e.g., dome roofs, aerospace vehicles, pressure vessels, containment vessels, etc. Yet the ability of engineers to predict the ultimate failure of such systems has heretofore been more of an art than a science (relying heavily upon costly experimental verification -- see &quot;Computerized Buckling Analysis of Shells&quot;, by D. Bushnell, Martinus Nijhoff 1985). The investigators combine new mathematical ideas of symmeytry and nonlinear analysis with high-performance computing methodology to analyze such systems efficiently and systematically. A long-term goal is to provide engineers with useful tools for the sytematic analysis (and ultimately better design) for this important class of structures. Funding for the project is provided by the Computational Mathematics program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS and b y the New Technologies program in CISE.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Even in today&apos;s increasingly digital world, analog continuous time circuits are needed in many applications. Current approaches to analog processing are running up against fundamental limitations. Log-domain filtering is a relatively new approach that offers wide dynamic range and excellent high-frequency response using simple, low-voltage circuits. Log-domain filters exploit the translinear current-voltage characteristics of bipolar transistors or weak-inversion MOSFETS to achieve overall linearity. The basic signal processing elements can be quite simple in form and their high-frequency performance can be excellent while distortion can be low because most of the transistor non-linearities are cancelled within the circuit. This research has three major thrusts: The first thrust is toward fundamental, design-oriented analysis of log-domain circuits. Design methodologies and fundamental understanding of the limitations of log-domain filters are in an early stage. Fundamental analyses allow development of figures of merit for evaluating and comparing log-domain circuits. The second thrust focuses on developing new log-domain circuit topologies. Based on an understanding of fundamental limitations, new circuits are being designed to improve performance. The third thrust is toward applications of log-domain circuits. Integrated circuits are being built and tested to demonstrate the usefulness of log-domain circuits in practical applications. Initial focus is on two application areas: low-voltage wireless communications, to exploit the performance potential of log- domain circuits and adaptive and biologically inspired circuits, to build on their fundamental simplicity.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Traditionally, in order to address the many complex issues that arise in communication networks, a ``layered&quot; approach has been taken. The different layers are typically assigned different ``responsibilities,&quot; so that the general network design problem can be decomposed into simpler, more manageable problems. However, the independent design of the different layers - which ignores the detailed nature of their mutual interactions, shared constraints, and cumulative impact on the network&apos;s overall performance - can lead to inefficiencies. Future wireless communication networks will be required to provide wide coverage and high capacity to mobile users generating bursty multi-media information. This heterogeneous traffic will impose upon the network time-varying quality of service (QoS) constraints. Since many multi-media applications have delay-sensitive information with varying reliability requirements, such as numerical data, voice, and video, the project will take end-to-end delay and data integrity as its dominant system constraints. The goal of this project is, in the broadest sense, to take a more global view of end-to-end performance, to better understand the interactions among the layers, to develop techniques that improve system performance through joint optimization over the various layers and to do so in the context of a end-to-end delay constraint. One key theme of the proposal involves the optimization of system performance in the context of multiple users, particularly in a system which does not employ a cellular-type architecture. This requires the development of techniques that, on the one hand, address the deleterious effects of multiple-user interference at the physical layer, yet also incorporate end-to-end QoS objectives, especially delay, just as with the development of routing and scheduling algorithms. Another major theme will be the determination of the optimal distribution and the real-time dynamics of error control functions implemented across t he layers of the network, subject to specified end-user requirements. This requires investigation of inherent tradeoffs between error-rate and decoding delay of FEC employed at the physical layer, as well as the interactions among error control functions, including retransmission strategies, invoked at higher levels.</data>

This additional information provides separate streams of data on the motions of the vocal folds (i.e., providing voiced excitation information) and on the soft palate, jaw, tongue, and lips. This project is designed to provide examples of these data from a representative sample of speakers to the speech community for their analysis. These include the use of two or more speech optimized radars with simultaneous speech, optained in several noise environments. In addition, studies of pitch synchronous processing using the excitation information and ARMA methods will be provided for selected voiced speech segments.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Coded Diversity Combining and Channel Estimation for Wireless Data Communications</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Recently, a new post-detection macrodiversity scheme was proposed for cellular communication systems. In this new scheme, termed Multiply-Detected Macrodiversity (MDM), the signals at multiple base stations are detected and used as input to a Decision Algorithm, which provides an optimal decision of what was transmitted. The MDM scheme shows considerable improvement in the Bit-Error Rate (BER), especially when the mobile is close to the boundary between cells. As the boundary between cells is exactly the region in which the quality of the mobile&apos;s signal is mostly impaired, the MDM scheme has the effect of equalizing the BER throughout the system coverage area. The Decision Algorithm of the MDM scheme requires as an input, in addition to the separate detections of the receivers, also an estimation of the quality of the received signals, so that appropriate&quot;weightings&quot; of these signals can be applied in the post-detection combining process. To obtain estimates, usually some sort of channel measurement is performed; e.g., the signal power (S-diversity) or the Signal-to-Interference-Ratio (S/I-diversity). In such cases, the measurement process complicates the design of the transmitter/receiver hardware and the operation of the system. Furthermore, the measurements are subject to high variance and need to be averaged over time. To avoid the disadvantage of the measurement-based quality of signal estimation, we propose here to investigate the use of channel coding to evaluate the transmission characteristics of a wireless channel for macrodiversity reception. The proposed channel estimation schemes use side information generated during the decoding process.In summary, we intend to study the use of the MDM combining with coded channel estimation in the case of a single site equipped with multiple,widely-separated receivers and in the case of multiple cell sites. In the latter case, we will investigate the use of both post-detection and predetection combining (with quantization of the recei ved signal), comparing the performance in the schemes in the presence of channel impairments characteristic to the mobile communication environment.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of the project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a broad-based language for scientific and engineering computation. Such a language should serve equally well for developing production scientific code (which is now typically written in FORTRAN or C) and as the scripting language for interactive scientific computing environments (such as Mathematica or Matlab). This breadth would greatly simplify the development of code by allowing a clean transition from prototyping and small- scale experiments to full production code, and would better support the evolution of production code. As a broad-based language it should support both numerical and symbolic computation, should include constructs r parallel programming, and should include the high-level language features found in systems such as Mathematica (e.g. pattern matching, higher-order functions, and automatic memory management). The project involves demonstrating that it is possible to support these features while maintaining good code efficiency. As such, the project includes work on compiler techniques, on language design, on the development of scientific codes, and experimentation on the codes using the compiler and language. The project is using ML extended with the parallel constructs from NESL as a testbed.</data>

The project involves demonstrating that it is possible to support these features while maintaining good code efficiency. As such, the project includes work on compiler techniques, on language design, on the development of scientific codes, and experimentation on the codes using the compiler and language. The project is using ML extended with the parallel constructs from NESL as a testbed.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this research is to study complexity issues, develop algorithms, and perform experiments with adaptive data compression algorithms, both lossless and lossy. The work proposed will build on our previous and current research and will have a continued &quot;theme&quot; of a blend of theoretical and experimental work. The term &quot;high performance&quot; has been used in the proposal title to indicate we are interested in algorithms that both compress well and can be implemented to run in real time in high bandwidth applications. The areas of research proposed are: * Error resilience; * Optimizations for one-dimensional lossless compression; * 2-D lossless compression; * Adaptive VQ; * Real-time video compression employing off-line learning; * Parallel algorithms for adaptive compression; * Automated browsing.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The purpose of this research is to design and analyze discrete algorithms solving hard combinatorial graph problems. Because many of these problems are NP-hard, an exact solution is often not feasible; in such cases approximation algorithms are a viable alternative. In addition to attacking approximation problems that seem to require new strategies, a main goal is to investigate the applicability of design principles developed successfully for traditional discrete optimization problems to comparable tasks occurring in other areas, in particular in Computational Molecular Biology and Operations Research. As problems of very similar combinatorial flavor are found in different areas, it can be expected that many solution methods are extendible as well. For example, previous research has resulted in the comparison method to analyze the approximation of the Maximum Independent Set problem for bounded degree graphs. A bipartite graph is used to compare an optimal solution with a solution found by an approximation algorithm. It can be expected that this method will have many more applications. The research plan includes new approaches to algorithm design applicable to various problems in algorithmic graph theory including Steiner trees and the graph isomorphism problem. Another goal is to study the limits of approximability by polynomial time algorithms. While several spectacular results have been obtained in this area, for many approximation problem the gap between the quality of the approximate solutions obtained in polynomial time and the proven hardness results remains large.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Computer networks (such as the Internet and the Global Information Infrastructure) have become critical for education, research, business, and military operations. Recent advances in network infrastructure technology (such as gigabit Ethernet, ATM and Ipv6) have enabled the development of high performance local area and wide area networks. Efficient management of these networks is essential. However, existing algorithmic methods for managing networks have not matured to the point where performance bottleneck and fault detection, isolation, correlation, and correction can be automated scalably. Thus, it is crucial to build efficient and user-friendly network monitoring, visualization, and control (NMVC) systems. The proposed effort is aimed at the design, prototype implementation, and demonstration of a highly scalable NMVC system with advanced algorithmic and human-in-the-loop capability. This capability allows network administrators to calibrate and fine-tune network and application parameters in real-time according to observed traffic patterns. The goal of the NMVC system is to ensure adequate quality of service to network users, while maintaining high network resource utilization. The proposed system leverages the following innovations to meet its objectives: * An inexpensive, yet high performance network monitoring and observation probe that does not interfere with high speed network traffic. This probe can be programmed to collect pertinent information at any layer in the protocol hierarchy (including application-specific information). * An efficient probing mechanism for endsystems (i.e., workstations and servers) that can collect relevant performance satistics from both applications and kernel resident protocols (such as TCP/IP in Unix). The endsystem probes introduce minimum interference with protocol operation and can be dynamically and remotely invoked and configured for the information of interest. * A highly flexible and highly efficient software network man agement agent design that extends the functionality and scalability of the network probe by filtering data based on programmable criteria (such as protocol header attributes or application-level frames). This agent can be configured, installed, and controlled remotely at network nodes by administrators or automated management applications. * Efficient online event ordering algorithms that can help synthesize and display a consistent view of network health, status, and performance using events collected throughout a large-scale high speed network. * A View Choreographer that allows management applications and administrators to specify the mapping of network events to higher-level events and to visualization objects and updates. The Choreographer uses semantically-guided filtering algorithms to enable low latency updates of displays that present an accurate real-time snapshot of current network state. * A visualization system that is highly configurable and can support multiple simultaneous real-time display views of a large-scale network. * Algorithmic and interactive steering mechanisms that perform critical network management functions such as protocol parameter tuning for better end-to-end performance, bandwidth enforcement, fault detection and recovery, and quality of service monitoring and control. * A prototype system to be demonstrated on a high speed IP/ATM testbed running a variety of applications (including multimedia teleconferencing systems and high speed digital imaging).</data>

      <data key="e_title">Equality Reasoning: Word and Unification Problems</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project concerns equational reasoning, with emphasis on word and unification problems. The investigation comprises graphs, congruence closure and equational unification, along with further development of these topics, and combinations of these topics. The objective is to develop new decidability and complexity results, and to design and implement efficient algorithms. The approach to word problems will use the rewriting paradigm, concentrating on procedures and data structures for computing complete/canonical sets of rewrite rules. In particular, the method using SOUR graphs for completing rewrite systems will be investigated, particularly the way in which SOUR Graphs can be used to develop procedures for solving the word problem in certain classes of theories. The first part of the research will be to examine the procedure in its simplest form, on string rewriting systems. Once methods are developed to solve the word problem in its simplest form, those methods will be moved back into pure equational logic, and finally into full first order equational logic. For ground equational theories, the plan is to investigate techniques for computing congruence closures based on the rewriting paradigm developed in studying Shostak&apos;s congruence closure method. Applications to combinations of decision procedures will be investigated. The relationship between the congruence closure method and SOUR graphs will be investigated and exploited. In unification, the concentration is on semantic unification, where some of the function symbols have semantics associated with them, usually specified in the form of an equational theory. The main focus of the applications is automated reasoning and symbolic computation. E-unification problems arising in process algebra. Knowledge representation and constraint solvers will also be investigated. Both theoretical and practical issues will be studied: (1) on the theoretical side, decidability and complexity issues on various eq uational unification and disunification problems will be investigated- --this is a continuation of work done over the past several years; (2) on the practical side, the goal is to come up with efficient algorithms along with fast implementations, making use of heuristics. Implementations will be incorporated into the Unification Workbench, a library of unification algorithms.</data>

ZOO is a generic Desktop Experiment Management Environment that can be customized and placed on the desks of many scientists to manage their experimental studies. Early experiences with a first prototype of Zoo have indicated that, as with general database systems, one of the biggest challenges lies with the system&apos;s user interface. The goal of this project is to investigate several hard problems related to advanced database user interfaces that appear particularly important for experiment management. These include problems related to schema visualization, experiment flow modeling, visual query languages, dynamic queries, approximate query answers, incremental queries, and others. This work proceeds in a tight loop between developing generic database user interface technology, incorporating the resulting techniques into ZOO, and installing customized enhancements of the tool in real-life experimentation environments for evaluation and feedback. The expected results of this research will advance the state of the art in database user interfaces and will be incorporated into the ZOO tools. Empowered with this fashion, ZOO will reach the necessary maturity to be placed in actual experiment production environments and enable scientists to manage their experimental studies efficiently and effectively.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">ABSTRACT NCR-9725251 Stephen Wicker, Terrence Fine, and Joseph Halpern Cornell University Predictive, Sensor-Assisted Wireless Multimedia Systems The PCS systems of the future will provide a variety of services to mobile users, including voice, high speed data, video, e-mail, teleconferencing, and the transfer of medical Images. The intelligent PCS network will be required to provide channel access with a minimum of call blocking, negotiate quality of service, allocate resources, and track users throughout their sessions. It is proposed to develop a series of expert systems that will optimize random access, resource allocation, and mobility management protocols. These expert systems will use a number of technologies and techniques from the fields of neural networks, artificial intelligence, and knowledge representation. There are three levels of agents in the proposed intelligent PCS network: mobile user, Base Station Controller (BSC), and the Mobile Switching Center (MSC). It is assumed that the PCS system is cellular, with several BSC&apos;s interacting with a single MSC. It is proposed to determine a means for representing and exploiting the information available to each type of agent. At the physical layer, in-band transmitted power levels will be tracked by a grid of low-cost sensors (radiometers). The sensors will provide power measurements as a function of time and location. In the proposal it is shown that this information can be used in the development of a BSC-based intelligent ALOHA multiple access scheme. Neural networks are described that can efficiently use the sensor data to estimate the number of users involved in individual collision events. This information is used in turn to estimate the number of backlogged users and to select an optimal backoff algorithm, thus maximizing Aloha channel throughput. The sensor grid can also be used by the BSC and MSC to support resource allocation, handoffs, and the tracking of scheduled user transmissions. In the proposed research program, sensor-based expert systems will be developed for three distinct phases of PCS operation: system planning and layout, multiple access, and adaptive resource allocation. Higher level information can be acquired and used at the BSC&apos;s and the MSC. The BSC&apos;s will obtain information regarding the local users&apos; bandwidth and quality of service requirements as a function of time. The BSC&apos;s will also track local channel conditions, and develop a detailed propagation model for the cell. The model will be used to as an aid to power control within the cell. The BSC is expected to act as an autonomous agent in local resource allocation and power control. The MSC will be responsible for allocating resources between cells. An allocation protocol will be developed to move resources between cells in response to traffic information acquired by the BSC&apos;s and passed to the MSC. The BSC&apos;s will also pass propagation and user tracking information to the MSC. The MSC will use this information to create a global propagation and user tracking model that will support the handoff decision process. An effort will be made to develop usage tendency profiles for individual users. The collection of user profiles will be used to develop models for global resource allocation.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">ABSTRACT NCR-9725251 Stephen Wicker, Terrence Fine, and Joseph Halpern Cornell University Predictive, Sensor-Assisted Wireless Multimedia Systems The PCS systems of the future will provide a variety of services to mobile users, including voice, high speed data, video, e-mail, teleconferencing, and the transfer of medical Images. The intelligent PCS network will be required to provide channel access with a minimum of call blocking, negotiate quality of service, allocate resources, and track users throughout their sessions. It is proposed to develop a series of expert systems that will optimize random access, resource allocation, and mobility management protocols. These expert systems will use a number of technologies and techniques from the fields of neural networks, artificial intelligence, and knowledge representation. There are three levels of agents in the proposed intelligent PCS network: mobile user, Base Station Controller (BSC), and the Mobile Switching Center (MSC). It is assumed that the PCS system is cellular, with several BSC&apos;s interacting with a single MSC. It is proposed to determine a means for representing and exploiting the information available to each type of agent.

      <data key="e_title">Maximizing Utility of Medical Imagery via Image Registration</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This research seeks to achieve a deeper understanding of the critical computer vision components and techniques needed to develop a new generation of image guided surgery systems. Such systems are important to the successful use of the emerging class of minimally invasive surgical procedures. Effective use of image guidance will improve the accuracy of such procedures, broaden the range of applicable procedures, and enable interactive patient-specific anatomical modeling. The key computer vision issues to be addressed are segmentation, data registration, instrument tracking and flexible modeling of structures. This research will develop methods for utilizing anatomical atlases and other anatomic knowledge, to provide structure-specific segmentation templates. Such atlases will need to be registered to the patient&apos;s data set, requiring new registration algorithms, that deal with flexible and deformable structures. Motion tracking algorithms are needed to monitor the position of surgical instruments within the operating field. By utilizing Mutual Information based registration algorithms, this proposal will develop tracking methods that match models of the surgical instruments to passive views of the operating field, enabling 3D tracking of those instruments. Finally, the tracked position of the surgical instruments, coupled with detected variations in images of the surgical field itself, the 3D models of the patient&apos;s anatomy will be automatically updated to reflect removal of tissue and changes in position of anatomical structures.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Data compression aims at producing an efficient representation for storage or transmission in order to communicate or store the smallest possible number of bits while retaining high quality in the reconstructed image. Statistical classification and segmentation are both concerned with labeling parts of an image as being of a certain type or class, such as tumor or normal tissue in a medical image or text, graphics, or photographs in a document page. Classification and segmentation can be used to assist human users of images, as in highlighting suspicious tissue in a medical image or defects in an imaged circuit, or they can be used for the automatic extraction of features in intelligent browsing of large databases. All three operations have in common the goal of efficiently representing an image as a whole, by optimally trading off quality and cost or distortion, an din decomposing the image into useful components. Most of the systems involving these operations, however, focus on each separate operation rather than on combining them into common algorithms with multiple goals. This project is devoted to the development of theory and algorithms for jointly performing these operations and related signal processing such as the estimation of probability distributions or models from observed data. The approach involves optimizing single combined systems subject to possibly conflicting combined goals, such as maximizing signal-to-noise ratios and minimizing bit rates and Bayes risk. Theory will be reinforced by simulations for both artificial sources, where theoretical performance bounds can be used for comparison, and real-world examples drawn from medical and document applications.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9726362 Barsky, Brian Sastry, S. Shankar University of California, Berkeley Challenges in CISE: Virtual Environments for Telesurgery and Surgical Training: Efficient Computation, Visualization and Interaction This research is focused on virtual environments for telesurgery and will result in software testbeds for eye and abdominal surgery. The development of these testbeds depends on the integration of the following research activities: Tissue modeling and rendering. For effective surgical training in virtual environments, deformable models of tissue are needed with sufficient accuracy, yet fast enough for real time interaction. Beginning with continuum models of solid behavior, suitable approximations will be developed that account for the compliance of tissue and the deformation of organs in the presence of a surgical tool. Methods for representing and rendering tissue shape, especially aspects that affect lighting models that provide important visual cues, will be compared. Haptic interaction with simulated models. There has been little work done or kinesthetic perception and display of compliant surfaces. Subjects&apos; perception of compliance will be measured under a variety of conditions to provide requirements for object modeling algorithms, and for teleoperation and haptic display schemes with high fidelity. Real time data fusion and 3-D visualization. Although surgeons have a variety of data sources available, they are not integrated into a useful 3-D model. A major difficulty in integrating real time data during surgery is compensating for shape changes due to deformability. Vessels and ducts will be used to provide road-maps to locate important features. Training and interaction with simulation. Modeling, rendering, and display factors that contribute to an environment that will be effective for training, yet efficient enough to run in real time will be determined. Using a set of fundamental skills, the contribution of these factors to training transfer in students and experienced surgeons will be experimentally studied.</data>

Techniques for improving memory system performance manifest themselves at various levels, from high-level algorithms and data structures, through compile-time analysis and restructuring of programs, to special architectural primitives that allow an application to better manage the memory hierarchy.

      <data key="e_abstract">9726370 Trivedi, Kishor Board, John A. Duke University Challenges in CISE: TUNE: System Support for Memory-Friendly Programming The pervasive use of multi-level memory hierarchies in microprocessor-based machines makes the performance of an application primarily determined by and extremely sensitive to its memory mapping, and requires memory-friendly programming: careful layout of data structures and restructuring of code to improve data locality. Techniques for improving memory system performance manifest themselves at various levels, from high-level algorithms and data structures, through compile-time analysis and restructuring of programs, to special architectural primitives that allow an application to better manage the memory hierarchy. The lack of automatic tools for improving data locality currently forces many application programmers to manually restructure their codes. Unfortunately, the sophisticated algorithms seen in modern scientific computing require equally sophisticated restructuring techniques. These techniques require expertise in computer architecture, burden the programmer with tedious machine-specific details unrelated to program correctness, and reduce the readability, maintainability, and portability of the restructured code. For all these reasons, manual restructuring of programs of any significant size is untenable, and some kind of system support is necessary. This project targets all aspects of this problem, from developing the relevant mathematical techniques for representing and manipulating data locality, through implementing interactive and automatic data locality management tools, to proposing innovative memory architectures for future-generation systems. The efficacy of the resulting system will be demonstrated using programs representative of modern scientific computations including divide-and-conquer scientific computations such as N-body solvers (e.g., fastmultipole) and many linear algebra kernels (e.g., Strassens&apos;s matrix multiplication algo rithm).</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9726389 Goldberg, Kenneth University of California-Berkeley Challenges in CISE: Planning and Control for Massively Parallel Manipulation Increased miniaturization of mass-produced products such as disk drives, displays, and sensors requires fundamental innovations in design and parts handling. Many of the components in these products will be integrated circuits and MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) fabricated with massively parallel wafer etching technology. Conventional pick and place robotic techniques are inadequate for the efficient assembly of these micron-scale components. This proposal addresses an entirely new methodology founded on recent insights from sensorless and minimalist robotics: massively parallel manipulation. The idea is to move parts using planar forces and moments that require a minimum of sensing and servoing. The shape of the field, as defined by the magnitude and direction of the force at each point, can be designed to position, align, sort, and assemble arrays of small parts in parallel. Planar force fields have enormous potential for precise parallel assembly of small parts. The goal of the research is to develop an entirely new methodology for precision part manipulation and to demonstrate it with new theory, algorithms, and high-performance devices. This research has the potential to parallelize the manufacture of a new generation of consumer and industrial products.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The research will investigate the computing challenges posed by extending large-scale multi-agent computational models to achieve both greater scale and more complex and realistic behaviors by individual agents. Individual agents in these models are represented by complex data structures that represent their internal states and behavioral repertoires. In agent populations of even modest size, the number of interaction histories (which determines the state of a model) is huge, so building realistic models poses significant computational hurdles. The primary aim of this research is to explore the quantity-complexity frontier: point at which there are tradeoffs between models with large numbers of simple agents and models with greater numbers of more complex agents. This project aims to develop innovative computational techniques to extend both the scale and the complexity of models by two to three orders of magnitude. Such advances are crucial to understanding whether phase changes occur when scale and/or complexity is significantly increased in multi-agent or social systems. It is also critical to future real-world applications of multi-agent systems modeling to problems such as understanding development and migration patterns (e.g. China), which pose problems of scale, and understanding peer-group effects on crime rates (which pose problems of modeling the complexity of individual agent behaviors).</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Units with a longer time basis than the traditional phones or sub- phones may provide a better structural basis for ASR systems customized for recognition of naturally spoken discourse. In this project, syllabic-length acoustic models are being explored for the recognition of conversational speech. The project entails: definition of the acoustic features derived from energy trajectories spanning ca. 250-ms intervals of speech; statistical modeling of these syllable-length regions; development of a decoding scheme designed to combine the outputs of these acoustic models with the more traditional phone- and sub-phone-length models; and embedding the syllable, phone and sub-phone features into a multi-tiered representation of language designed for robust recognition under a wide range of acoustic-environmental and speaking conditions. A complete ASR system is being developed that will incorporate the results of this research, and will be evaluated on fluent speech. Successful results with the recognition system have the potential to improve practical ASR systems that must deal with the decoding of spontaneous discourse. Additionally, the analysis of longer-time structure at the acoustic, statistical, and lexical levels should improve our basic knowledge about the structure of conversation speech.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this project is to investigate several types of cryptographic protocols that are unconditionally secure, i.e., their security does not require any computational assumptions. Examples of topics to be studied include construction of efficient authentication codes, robust secret sharing schemes, key distribution schemes and broadcast encryption schemes. All of these topics are of fundamental importance in cryptography in providing for confidentiality and/or integrity of information. As the Internet becomes increasingly important in everyday life, security of the information it contains is a critical factor. Hence, methods of providing information security are of great practical importance. Unconditionally secure protocols are very desirable precisely because their security can be rigorously proved and quantified. The main mathematical tools used are combinatorial in nature; error-correcting codes and combinatoral designs play an essential role. Other mathematical techniques come into play in an important way, including information theory and number theory. The two main objectives are to construct new, practical, efficient schemes, and to evaluate them in terms of the amount of secret information that needs to be exchanged and the computational complexity of the actual algorithms that implement them. Thus there is a whole spectrum of activity to be carried out, from initially providing a mathematical solution to the actual implementation of an algorithm.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Unreliable failure detection has been gaining acceptance as a fundamental paradigm for fault-tolerant distributed computing. This paradigm was originally introduced to circumvent the impossibility of achieving consensus in asynchronous systems with crash failures. The proposed research aims to extend the applicability of failure detection in multiple ways: (1) It will seek solutions that tolerate both process crashes and link failures, and in particular, solutions that are resilient to network partitioning. (2) It will consider practical problems besides consensus, e.g., atomic commitment and various forms of group membership. (3) It will investigate the extension of failure detection to other models, such as the timed asynchronous model, in order to solve problems whose specifications involve real-time. (4) It will explore the use of randomization techniques to enhance the power of failure detection. This research intends to widen the scope of failure detection and to firmly establish it as a core component of fault-tolerant distributed systems.</data>

The project is aimed at improving the expressiveness, efficiency and ease of use of tabled logic programming systems. The main goals of this project are: (a) To study the interaction of constraint solving with tabled resolution, a combination that considerably increases the expressiveness of tabled logic programming systems. (b)To design techniques for optimizing tabled constraint logic programming systems by extending traditional factoring and indexing to constraints, and by selective tabling. (c) To construct tools for high-level debugging of tabled logic programs. Tabling and constraints have both separately introduced a new level of declarativeness to traditional logic programming systems. The combination of tabling and constraints enables encoding of problems that cannot be solved declaratively using either individual paradigm. Tabled constraint logic programming thus promises to be a significant step towards realizing the ideal of declarative programming.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Multi-Fractal Scaling of Hydraulic Conductivity Distributions and the Effect on Plume-Scale Contaminant Transport</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9706048 Molz From a contaminant transport viewpoint, hydraulic conductivity (K) is the single most important property function. K is highly heterogeneous, and quantifying the K distribution is a prerequisite to understanding contaminant migration. Over the past decade an increasing number of studies have documented the existence of fractal scaling in K distributions. However, the scaling appears to be of a variable nature that is characterized by a special family of PDF&apos;s known as Levy-stable processes. Different sets of increments display properties of different members of the Levy-stable class, which suggests a type of fractal known as a universal multi-fractal. It has been shown recently that the universal multi-fractal paradigm, which includes monofractals as a special case, is successful in modeling the fractal scaling in most K data sets, and the desire to exploit this observation fully is the motivation of the present proposal. The 3 objectives are: I) Develop procedures for the generation and data conditioning of 3-D multi-fractal structures; II) Evaluate multi-fractal effects on solute transport by simulating tracer tests conducted at the highly heterogeneous MADE site; and III) Determine the behavior of plume-scale apparent dispersivity involving multi-fractal scaling and compare the results to that derived from conventional statistical theories. Meeting these 3 objectives will increase understanding significantly of fractal scaling in porous media and the effect on contaminant transport.</data>

      <data key="e_title">A New Generic Indexing Technology for Digital Library Support</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">There has been no significant change in the dynamic indexing methods supporting database systems since the invention of the B-tree over twenty-five years ago. And yet the whole classical approach to dynamic database indexing has long since become inappropriate and increasingly inadequate: we are moving rapidly from the conventional one-dimensional world of fixed-structure text and numbers to a multi-dimensional world of variable structures, objects and images, in space and time. This project is based on a new multi-dimensional indexing technology which rejects conventional benchmark criteria in favor of a natural principle intuitively understood by users: the more information given to guide a query, the faster the response - regardless of any particular instantiation pattern. As a result, conventional relational indexing becomes much more flexible, with some classes of query improving on average by an order of magnitude, while retaining the logarithmic storage and update characteristics of the B-tree. But the main feature of the technology is its applicability to a much wider range of data types -- from nested relations to logic clauses, and from spatial objects to pictorial images. Two specific areas show particular promise: the efficient indexing of large rule bases, and substantially improved performance of very large and mission-critical GIS (geographic information systems) applications. Digital libraries will be used as an initial focus for enhanced support and as testbeds for comparative performance evaluation.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The idea of executing a transactional system under a lower isolation level than perfect Serializable isolation was introduced in a 1977 paper by IBM researchers, and implemented in IBM&apos;s DB2. It is now offered by most commercial DBMS systems supporting multi-user applications. Lower isolation levels permit more transactional threads to simultaneously execute an application, so processor resources are more effectively utilized. The tradeoff is that in perfect isolation, no update performed by one application thread can have any effect on data read and updated by an independent transactional thread; in lower isolation levels this is no longer the case. The intent is to use lower isolation levels only for &quot;safe&quot; applications, where the application code will not use isolation weaknesses to arrive at erroneous results. But the database field has no general method for deciding what applications are &quot;safe&quot;. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a method for evaluating large transactional application systems to determine what errors can arise at different isolation levels in common commercial use. This process of evaluation is to be known as Isolation Testing, and provides a list of all isolation problems that can occur in the workload. It is then possible to make modest changes in the database and application design to eliminate these errors and gain the advantage of a lower isolation level. Isolation Testing has the potential to make many of the largest commercial applications (e.g., banking, airline reservations) more efficient in their use of computer resources.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project probes the nature of psychological representations of discourse and applies the results to a computational model of &quot;who knows what&quot; in text about multiple agents. Many kinds of inferences and pragmatic effects depend on knowing who has access to which information, as well as who shares common ground. Computational and psychological models of text understanding have largely ignored the ramifications of multiple agent sources on the representation and use of textual information. Our objectives are: A) to examine how people process and represent the distinct knowledge states of agents depicted or quoted in both constructed and naturally occurring texts, B) to investigate how readers&apos; representations of texts are affected by the perspectives they bring to these texts, as well as by how sources are presented, and C) to apply these empirical results to the construction of a partly-automated system for extracting, representing, and coding &quot;who knows what&quot; in a large corpus of naturally occurring texts - news stories from The Wall Street Journal. This research will contribute to practical goals concerning the modeling and extraction of information from text and reported speech, as well as to theoretical goals concerning how people process and represent texts about multiple agents.</data>

In some of the design problems the agent at a node is assumed, in effect, to be a robot who behaves as the designer wishes, while in others the agent is autonomous and has independent goals that the designer has to take into account. Networks serve different purposes: transforming inputs into outputs, sending messages from one node to another, transporting commodities, coordinating mobile units, or dividing up computational tasks among processors. Part of this research considers differences between those purposes as well as their common properties. Other parts of the research pursue general themes in the design of efficient human organizations and the adaptation of market mechanisms to novel tasks of resource allocation.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Past failures in building large-scale distributed applications in areas such as avionics and telephony are painful reminders of the difficulty of developing and debugging distributed programs. As applications become more ambitious in both scale and functionality, these problems will only be compounded. The Seuss project is based on the premise that this complexity can be managed by adopting a simpler model of computation. The Seuss programming model builds distributed applications from large sequential components which interact through small but complex interfaces. This project has the following goals: (1) to develop conceptual tools for reducing the complexity of these interfaces, (2) to reuse sequential pieces of code written in standard languages, (3) to achieve efficiency by executing the various components concurrently. More specifically, the Seuss model of concurrent object oriented programming reduces the complexity of concurrency by allowing programmers to reason about distributed applications as if they were sequential programs. At the same time, Seuss allows programs to be executed with multiple threads of control. Finally, Seuss provides a logic for proving the equivalence of sequential Seuss programs and their multi-threaded executions. This project will allow programmers to build qualitatively more complex distributed applications with the assurance that they are both efficient and correct.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Sensorimotor Cognition---The Earliest Knowledge Structures</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This research investigates the origins of knowledge and conceptual structure. An interactionist perspective leads to a computational model in which the earliest knowledge structures are influenced by both native structure in the agent and its exposure to the world. `Physical schemas` are learned that form stable, dynamical relationships between the agent and the world based on closed-loop `physical primitives.` A preimaging technique is used to form context-dependent categories spontaneously in order to improve the quality of sensory and motor behavior. Declarative models are lifted from the sensorimotor substrate in the form of `figurative schema.` This representation includes explicit predictive models of sensation and affect, and thus captures some of the underlying semantics of behavioral policies. An integrated robot system is used as the experimental platform. The implications of this work extend to developmental psychology, epistemology, and psycholinguistics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Computational agents built on these principles refer ultimately to the physical world for meaning --- the same physical world that shapes human conceptual structure. We foresee interfaces to electronic agents that appeal to semantics based in the physical world to understand the `meaning` of a human request.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this research is to investigate the relationship between the occurrence of significant topics in a document and the structure of the document. The unique contribution of this research lies in the combination of methods to be used for the production of a list of significant topics, built on both statistical and rule-based techniques for the identification of term variants as a function of their distribution in focus areas in documents. Applications that can employ these methods include information retrieval, passage retrieval, relevance feedback, information extraction, and summarization. The results can be used directly in ongoing research projects on automatic summarization of documents, using both statistical and information extraction techniques, i.e., combining information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP). To the extent that these techniques are based on linguistically-motivated patterns and not on domain-dependent vocabularies, these patterns should apply to general text. This approach will be applied to several domains to test its generality and applicability across document types. This will permit measuring the cost of porting across genres. Formative and summative evaluation procedures will be developed and performed at each step of the analysis. This research is undertaken in the context of the Digital Library Research Program at Columbia University, in conjunction with the Center for Research on Information Access. The resulting techniques grounded in the novel combination and cross-fertilization of IR and NLP methods are expected to improve information access based on significant topics across domains and genres.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9724495 Goldberg, Mark Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Acquisition of Instrumentation to Facilitate Large Scale Parallel Computation Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) will be acquiring three four-processor shared-memory computers. The equipment will be used to support research in parallel adaptive computation, silicon simulation, software tools development for parallel scientific computation, generic software libraries for parallel computation, learning algorithms for combinatorial optimization, and query optimization in heterogeneous mediated systems. RPI will also be developing a library of programming tools for handling distributed computing on a cluster of high-power shared memory workstations and will make this software freely available to the scientific community and accessible through the World Wide Web. The equipment will also be used in undergraduate courses in computational science and engineering, in particular a studio course in algorithm design and a second course in the design and implementation of generic software. Both of these courses provide hands-on experience for students and will thus allow direct involvement with the new equipment.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This research investigates computer support for learning, working, and collaborating. It focuses on communities of practice (such as local area network managers and research teams) as subgroups within and across organizations. It involves work with specific communities to study their actual and potential learning processes. Based on the interpretation and assessment of these observations and theories from the research literature and previous work the project will develop and articulate a new conceptual framework for computational support of organizational learning. The research issues to be addressed include (1) how to capture knowledge and integrate the contexts of work; (2)how to sustain timeliness and utility of evolving information, and (3) how to deliver relevant information actively and adaptively. To assess and develop this framework, organizational memories will be created in collaboration with these communities, that include (1) mechanisms to capture and represent task specifications, work artifacts, and group communications; (2) facilities for practitioners to reorganize and sustain the usefulness of the memory; and (3)techniques of access and delivery for knowledge relevant to current tasks,. The project will extend emerging WWW technologies with structured web-site interactivity, version control of evolving information, software critiquing agents, and end-user programmability. Finally, the memory and learning prototypes will be assessed in naturalistic settings.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9720395 Lester, James C. North Carolina State University Learning and Intelligent Systems: Animated Pedagogical Agent for Constructivist Learning Environments Constructivist learning environments facilitate discovery-based learning through creative problem-solving experiences. To do so, they should provide scaffolding in the form of highly contextualized problem-solving advice that is customized to each learner. Perhaps the most intriguing vehicle for providing such dynamically individualized scaffolding is the technology of animated pedagogical agents. Featured prominently in learning environments, they couple key feedback functionalities with a strong, lifelike visual presence. The objectives of the proposed research are two-fold:(1)Creating a new generation of intelligent constructivist learning environments with animated pedagogical agents; and(2)Providing a comprehensive, data-rich account of the cognitive processes and results of interacting with constructivist learning environments with animated pedagogical agents. Employing a broad array of quantitative and qualitative measure of learning, the large multidisciplinary research team is working closely with students and teachers in a local school system to conduct extensive empirical studies of learners&apos; interactions with these environments. This work makes significant contributions to the growing body of research that blends technology,cognitive science,and learning and teaching. First,it creates a rich constructivist frame work for learning-by-designing that couples exploratory learning with strong scaffolded support. Second, by focusing on analyses of the cognitive changes that learners undergo,it identifies precisely which technologies and conditions contribute most to effective learning.Third, because it employs a participatory design process that facilitates the technology&apos;s incorporation into school settings in authentic ways,it is expected that it will have a direct and significant impact on classroom experience well into the 21st century.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Learning and Intelligent Systems: Animated Pedagogical Agents for Constructivist Learning Environments</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9720395 Lester, James C. North Carolina State University Learning and Intelligent Systems: Animated Pedagogical Agent for Constructivist Learning Environments Constructivist learning environments facilitate discovery-based learning through creative problem-solving experiences. To do so, they should provide scaffolding in the form of highly contextualized problem-solving advice that is customized to each learner. Perhaps the most intriguing vehicle for providing such dynamically individualized scaffolding is the technology of animated pedagogical agents. Featured prominently in learning environments, they couple key feedback functionalities with a strong, lifelike visual presence. The objectives of the proposed research are two-fold:(1)Creating a new generation of intelligent constructivist learning environments with animated pedagogical agents; and(2)Providing a comprehensive, data-rich account of the cognitive processes and results of interacting with constructivist learning environments with animated pedagogical agents. Employing a broad array of quantitative and qualitative measure of learning, the large multidisciplinary research team is working closely with students and teachers in a local school system to conduct extensive empirical studies of learners&apos; interactions with these environments. This work makes significant contributions to the growing body of research that blends technology,cognitive science,and learning and teaching. First,it creates a rich constructivist frame work for learning-by-designing that couples exploratory learning with strong scaffolded support. Second, by focusing on analyses of the cognitive changes that learners undergo,it identifies precisely which technologies and conditions contribute most to effective learning.Third, because it employs a participatory design process that facilitates the technology&apos;s incorporation into school settings in authentic ways,it is expected that it will have a direct and significant impact on classroom experience well into the 21st century.</data>

      <data key="e_title">A Staged Compiler Architecture for Dynamic Program Optimization</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project focuses on the design and implementation of a compiler architecture for dynamically optimizing stand-alone programs. Dynamic optimization uses run-time values and invariants to improve code as it executes, yielding performance superior to that of statically optimal code. Dynamic optimization incurs run-time overhead: time spent optimizing and compiling code at run time detracts from any resulting improvement. This overhead will be reduced using a staged compilation model, which permits static compilation to be suspended after reaching a high-level, mid-level, or low-level intermediate representation. This technique supports lightweight optimizations, which are fast but typically yield minor improvements, as well as heavyweight optimizations, which are time consuming but often provide substantial performance benefits. The proposed system will incorporate automatic program analyses and profiling tools to uncover opportunities for dynamic optimization in ordinary code, and a rich set of optimization directives will give the programmer fine- grained control over dynamic optimization when necessary.</data>

      <data key="e_title">A New Approach for Processing Compressed Data</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">As the amount of digital information increases rapidly, the ability to store, transmit, or process digital data efficiently becomes a significant issue. Any further improvement in handling digital information, beyond technological limits in storage capacity and communication bandwidth, should come from manipulating compressed data. In the first part of this project, execution of common operations in document image understanding and OCR on CCITT-G4 compressed data is examined. These operations include: blob coloring, thinning, and morphological techniques. Direct manipulation of JBIG-coded documents with and without progressive coding is another objective of this project. For JBIG data, skew estimation and connected component algorithms are investigated. In addition, image processing algorithms for compressed binary document images and engineering drawings are implemented. The second part of this project deals with the feasibility of developing a new source code that allows quick string matching (exact and approximate) for OCR-generated text data. Furthermore, a new lossless binary image compression scheme that allows fast skew estimation for image rotation is developed. Algorithms developed under this project should contribute to efficient utilization of storage and bandwidth in information, computation and telecommunication technologies.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Similarity Based Retrieval From Video and Pictorial Databases</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The objective of this research is to develop a system for similarity based retrieval from video and pictorial databases. The system is based on an expressive query language called Hierarchical Temporal Logic (HTL) that represents the temporal and pictorial content of video data. HTL predicates are then matched with the database using multidimensional similarity measures. The approach includes development of representation and preprocessing methods for pictorial feature extraction both for generic objects and generic motion. The features extracted include spectral signatures of shape and motion, local and global color histograms and texture. Articulated motion in video is decomposed into basic components using Motion Spectral Signatures (MSS). Generic objects are recognized using Affine Invariant Spectral Signatures (AISS) and Expansion Matching (EXM) based indexing in the frequency domain. Motion and object representations are then utilized to construct a dictionary of HTL atomic predicates with multidimensional hyper-regional representation. An on-line learning capability for expanding the dictionary is also planned. Improved methods for video shot and scene segmentation are to be developed as well. The results of this research will provide an efficient means for query retrieval from video and pictorial databases. Such a system will have many applications in digital libraries and in TV movie industries.</data>

Research into the application of systems characterized by low-bandwidth interactive channels between clients and server, and a high-bandwidth broadcast from server to clients will be conducted. The proposed work will develop communications abstractions that applications can effectively use for such an infrastructure, and computational models for these abstractions. Model performance will then be evaluated on a testbed of multiple semi-autonomous robotic agents. The challenging problems to be addressed in this project include: (1) selecting which path to take from server to client; (2) determining the degree of broadcast channel sharing possible in a computer communications environment; and (3) scheduling transmissions from the shared broadcast terminal. The research will also target three fundamental problems underlying coordination of robotic agents: (1) development of world models based on observations of individual agents and exploration of an unknown or a partially known environment to build a complete model; (2) task planning based on the world model while accounting for possible uncertainties and latencies; and (3) control of robotic agents based on visual and other sensory information.</data>

The challenging problems to be addressed in this project include: (1) selecting which path to take from server to client; (2) determining the degree of broadcast channel sharing possible in a computer communications environment; and (3) scheduling transmissions from the shared broadcast terminal. The research will also target three fundamental problems underlying coordination of robotic agents: (1) development of world models based on observations of individual agents and exploration of an unknown or a partially known environment to build a complete model; (2) task planning based on the world model while accounting for possible uncertainties and latencies; and (3) control of robotic agents based on visual and other sensory information.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">CDA-9703220 Bajcsy, Ruzena University of Pennsylvania Asymmetric Bandwidth Channels: Applications to Real-Time Computing and Robotics This award is for the acquisition of infrastructure to support research which is to investigate a cost-effective and broadly deployed communication model, Asymmetric Bandwidth Channels, for which few abstractions in computer science are available. Research into the application of systems characterized by low-bandwidth interactive channels between clients and server, and a high-bandwidth broadcast from server to clients will be conducted. The proposed work will develop communications abstractions that applications can effectively use for such an infrastructure, and computational models for these abstractions. Model performance will then be evaluated on a testbed of multiple semi-autonomous robotic agents.

      <data key="e_title">Geometric Techniques for Multidimensional Databases</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Storage and retrieval of multidimensional data is necessary for many scientific, geographic, engineering, and business applications. Traditional database secondary storage indexing techniques such as B-trees and hash tables are not suitable for dealing with multidimensional data, as data access is performed by concentrating on only one-dimension at a time and large quantities of extraneous data may be retrieved. The main goal of this project is to explore and develop techniques for efficient loading, retrieval, and update of large disk-resident multidimensional data for both single machine and parallel machine architectures. Storage and processing of both point and region data are considered. The database community has independently developed a number of disk-based multi-dimensional indexing schemes, without applying results from relevant fields that may significantly improve loading and retrieval performance. Accordingly, the approach used in this project is firmly grounded within the realm of computational geometry, a discipline that has produced numerous techniques for the efficient processing of memory-resident multidimensional data. The generalization and improvement of these techniques to handle efficiently disk-resident data is an important part of this research. Additionally, the use of parallelism to provide improved load and query response times for very large data sets is also considered. The resulting indexing techniques will enable higher level database architectures to provide efficient access to the very large multi-dimensional datasets of the future, thus enabling database technology to keep up with demands placed upon it from science and business as a whole.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Effectiveness and Efficiency of Fault Removal Techniques</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Because lack of control and replication impede many software engineering studies, there is a need to design experiments that take advantage of completed projects (and the associated data), rather than &quot;live&quot; projects (where the goal of getting the product out the door may compete with data capture and analysis goals). The research project involves conceiving, designing and preparing a collection of large-scale, multi-location retrospective experiments. The research focuses on four fault identification techniques (requirements inspection, formal specification, formal design, and fault injection), building upon existing work by determining which methods are more effective and in what contexts. In particular, the project seeks evidence about which method is most effective and/or efficient at fault identification and removal. The research involves a consortium of industrial and academic partners, all affiliated with Howard University&apos;s Center for Research in Evaluating Software Technology. Where possible, parts of the experimental design will be tested by running parts of the experiment with student projects to confirm its feasibility and to help direct the preparatory efforts. The results should have wide impact, both on the community of practitioners (who will find the results useful for guiding resource allocation decisions) and researchers (who will note the feasibility of doing software engineering field experiments with retrospective data).</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">MESSENGERS is a distributed programming system based on the principles of self-migrating threads, which carry their own identity and behavior in the form of programs. This enables them to navigate freely in the underlying computational network, communicate with one another, and invoke native- mode C functions. Thus MESSENGERS is a general coordination paradigm for distributed applications development. Its main advantages are dynamic composability of applications, enabling an interactive and incremental development of arbitrarily extensible applications, and the ability to exploit clusters of heterogeneous workstations. This project investigates the capabilities of this new technology primarily in the context of individual-based simulation, that is, simulation where the application is modeled as a collection of autonomous individuals (e.g. particles in physics), each having its own state and behavior. It focuses on issues of performance and scalability by developing new techniques for load balancing and dynamic resource utilization that exploit the self-migration nature of the subcomputations.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Broadcast and Epidemic Communication for Managing ReplicatedData</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Many commercial database products and application tools are beginning to support data replication to provide ready access to data in distributed, mobile, and disconnected environments. Most of these systems have chosen to use asynchronous replication schemes in which updates to replicas are not synchronized. Although these schemes perform reasonably well for single object updates (i.e., environments such as file-systems), they are not suitable when a single update involves multiple objects (i.e., transactional environments). This project investigates the benefits of using synchronous and asynchronous broadcast mechanisms for managing replicated databases. Broadcast primitives, viz., reliable broadcast, causal broadcast, and atomic broadcast, will be used to design new protocols for synchronous replication. In synchronous replication, transactions accessing replicated data are synchronized with other transactions in the system. In asynchronous replication, transactions execute locally and other means are used to disseminate their effects globally as well as to detect and correct inconsistencies. The epidemic model of communication will be used as the transport mechanism here. Pessimistic as well as optimistic replication protocols will be developed to maintain replicas asynchronously. Finally, a simulation framework will be developed to evaluate the protocols for synchronous and asynchronous replication.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Methods for Matrix Optimization Problems in Control and Statistical Signal Processing</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">ECS-9707111 Boyd Powerful new methods for various convex matrix optimization problems have emerged over the last few years. Most of this research has concentrated on the semidefinite programming problem (SDP), i. e., the problem of minimizing a linear cost function over linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). SDPs are convex optimization problems that can be solved with great efficiency using recently developed interior-point algorithms. These matrix optimization methods have had immediate practical and theoretical impact in several fields, notably control systems and combinatorial optimization. In control theory, the basic idea is to formulate the analysis or synthesis problem in terms of convex matrix optimization problems, which are then solved numerically. The current state of research on LMIs in control can be summarized: There has been intensive research on identifying control problems that can be cast in terms of LMIS, and those for which an LM1 formulation is unlikely to exist. In the latter case, bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIS) have been recognized as a unifying form. The combined activity in mathematical programming and control theory has led to very rapid progress in interior-point algorithms for solving SDPS, focusing on local convergence rates, worst-case complexity, etc., and on extending to SDP the sophisticated and efficient primal-dual interior-point methods developed for linear programming (LP). Several basic software implementations of interior-point methods for SDP have become available. These codes have proven useful for small to medium-sized problems, but tend to be too slow for larger problems, since they exploit little or no problem structure. LMls are becoming basic tools in control, much the way Riccati equations became basic tools in the 1960s. Thus, LMI/SDP solvers are becoming part of the infrastructure of control (computation and practice), just as Riccati equation solvers are now. The same techniques can be applied in several other fields. In statistical signal processing, for example, SDP allows one to define optimization problems that involve representation and decomposition of covariance matrices. Here many challenges are still to be found in the problem formulation area (i.e., identifying statistical signal processing problems that can be cast in this framework) but it is already clear that the approach will be rewarding. Perhaps even more than in control, practical use of matrix optimization in statistics will require efficient algorithms for large-scale problems. This proposal brings together researchers in the three key areas involved: control theory, statistics, and large-scale numerical optimization, in order to address the next logical areas of research: identification of the problems in statistical signal processing that can be formulated in terms of LMIS, and the development of more powerful algorithms (and practical codes) for the matrix optimization problems that arise in control and statistical signal processing. The research effort will be complemented with a strong educational component, by integrating the effort with the newly developed course Convex Optimization with Engineering Applications. We will transition new research results in statistical signal processing directly into the course material, which will help broaden the range of applications presented in the course. The new research on numerical methods will enter the course in two important ways: first, as an advanced topic on implementation (missing from the current course), and second, by providing tools that students can use during the course, especially in projects. Another important (but less direct) educational goal is to train two PhD students in a completely interdisciplinary fashion, equipping them with skills that range from, say, robust control theory or statistics, to optimization theory and implementation of large-scale numerical algorithms. As the power of computing continues its exponential rise, researchers with this background will be increasingly valuable.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">We propose an integrated approach to minimizing power consumption of high-performance wireless communication systems. Our interdisciplinary approach will simultaneously address key levels of system design: minimum-energy communication techniques, energy-efficient signal processing electronics, high efficiency RF front-ends, and concurrent optimization methods. Our objective will be reached by developing design methodologies in the following research areas: (a) Modulation, detection, equalization, diversity, and resource allocation techniques for time and code-division multiple-access channels, which instead of concentrating on achieving channel capacity without regard to complexity, focus on minimum-energy communications while accounting for energy consumption for their implementation (b) Low-energy mixed-signal electronics to perform baseband functions such as data processing, coding, equalization etc. Our approach includes two components: digital logic with energy recovery using switch-mode RF circuits, and very low-power analog neural hardware. (c) High-efficiency integrated active antenna arrays, with a potential for manifold increase in overall DC to radiated carrier power efficiency. Our approach saves space and power by integrating high-efficiency switch-mode RF circuits with compact antenna arrays, allowing added functionality such as beam forming and (d) Concurrent design optimization over stochastic parameters, which can yield significantly lower power consumption in existing designs, and can take further advantage of the above methodologies. These savings will yield smaller, lighter, more reliable, and more capable wireless, hand-held, lap-top, and vehicular communication devices. The developed technologies and design methodologies will apply to mobile communication systems for the more than 25 million U.S. cellular subscribers as well as the millions of PCS subscribers over the horizon.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this project is to investigate the use of adaptive techniques to minimize the power consumed by peripherals in mobile computing systems. Since battery life is one of the most critical resources in the mobile computing environment, good energy conservation methods can dramatically increase the utility of mobile systems. The investigators have previously demonstrated that new adaptive techniques from the machine learning community are very effective in solving disk spin-down problem (deciding when to shut down the disk in order to maximize power savings) on traces of disk activity. The project will continue this work in two directions. The first direction is to compare the performance of the new techniques with that of other adaptive algorithms for the spin-down problem. The second direction involves applying similar machine learning methods to wireless modems (radios). In addition to the power savings gained by turning off the radio when the network interface is not needed, adaptively choosing the broadcast power level may also lead to significant energy savings.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The current explosion in multimedia applications and services has been primarily enabled by the significant recent advances in image and video compression technology, e.g., JPEG for still images and MPEG for video, which have become household and marketing terms. Digital HDTV is on the horizon, and will be based on the MPEG-2 standard. Does this mean that image/video coding has reached a state of saturation where more research on compression is unlikely to yield significant improvements? This research tries to shed light on this by investigating the fundamental performance bounds on image and video compression. A primary goal is to uncover the performance gaps between existing commercial systems and the theoretical performance optimally attainable, and to guide the generation of improved compression algorithms in the future. The main focus of this research is to derive fundamental rate--distortion bounds for realistic classes of image and video models. This enables the generation of reliable estimates of the gap between the optimal performance theoretically attainable for these models and that of specific coding algorithms based on them. The analytical approach of this research contains the following key components: (1) a hierarchy of increasingly complex and realistic image/video models; (2) derivation of rate-distortion bounds for these models; (3) analysis of model parameter identifiability and estimation accuracy; (4) compression based on universal spectrum-blind spatio-temporal sampling techniques, and (5) model validation on real images/video based on high-performance practical algorithms.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The current explosion in multimedia applications and services has been primarily enabled by the significant recent advances in image and video compression technology, e.g., JPEG for still images and MPEG for video, which have become household and marketing terms. Digital HDTV is on the horizon, and will be based on the MPEG-2 standard. Does this mean that image/video coding has reached a state of saturation where more research on compression is unlikely to yield significant improvements? This research tries to shed light on this by investigating the fundamental performance bounds on image and video compression. A primary goal is to uncover the performance gaps between existing commercial systems and the theoretical performance optimally attainable, and to guide the generation of improved compression algorithms in the future. The main focus of this research is to derive fundamental rate--distortion bounds for realistic classes of image and video models. This enables the generation of reliable estimates of the gap between the optimal performance theoretically attainable for these models and that of specific coding algorithms based on them. The analytical approach of this research contains the following key components: (1) a hierarchy of increasingly complex and realistic image/video models; (2) derivation of rate-distortion bounds for these models; (3) analysis of model parameter identifiability and estimation accuracy; (4) compression based on universal spectrum-blind spatio-temporal sampling techniques, and (5) model validation on real images/video based on high-performance practical algorithms.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Content-Based Image Retrieval for Medical Databases</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Increasing computerization of the process of acquiring and storing diagnostic images requires more sophisticated approaches to image retrieval in order to optimally use the images for improved health-care delivery, physician education and research. A content-based image retrieval system is being developed that takes a human-in-the-loop approach, because completely automated approaches are not feasible for radiological images in which the clinically useful information may consist of gray level and texture deviations in highly localized but difficult-to-segment regions of an image. In this approach, a physician manually delineates the pathology-bearing regions in an image. The CBIR system then analyzes these regions for their properties and uses a graph representation, augmented with the spatial relationships of the pathology bearing regions to anatomical landmarks, to index the images into a database and retrieve similar images typically with known diagnoses. This project focuses on the domain of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images in patients with a variety of lung diseases. Regarding scientific goals, the project addresses: (1) the computational complexity of retrieval and its mitigation by the use of appropriate heuristics; (2) selection of similarity criteria to use for comparing the pathology-bearing regions of the query and indexed images; and (3) the design of a physician-friendly software architecture that allows for extension to other disease categories.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Program specialization has a distinguished history. Under the name of self-modifying code it has been used in the past for performance improvements. Under the name of partial evaluation it has been used as a transformation to automatically generate compilers from interpreters for declarative languages. Recently, a number of research groups have applied run-time partial evaluation to do run-time code generation (RTCG) as a performance optimization, but they require extensive programmer annotations to determine where to apply the transformation. Transformations do not always yield good optimizations, particularly where the cost/benefit tradeoffs are not highly obvious. This project is developing automatic methods (algorithms and heuristics) for selecting where to apply run-time code generation (RTCG), and examining the interaction between RTCG and scalar and memory-hierarchy optimizations. The project is applying RTCG to a large number of complete scientific applications to determine its applicability. Heretofore RTCG has been applied to benchmark kernels and language interpreters, but not to any wider domains. This project aims to demonstrate that RTCG is ready for production use and that it can be deployed in compilers without requiring extensive reprogramming of applications to make use of its performance improvements.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This research examings the role of working memory (WM) capacity constraints and individual differences in WM capacity in the Payne/Bettman/Johnson framework of effort-accuracy tradeoffs in the processing of multiattribute information for the purpose of choice. The P.I. will do so with the help of eye-movement data and with the help of theory that links WM load to pupil diameter, thus providing an on-line measure of effort. The goal of the research is to analyze how changes in the difficulty of a choice task influence choice behavior. The research develops a computational cognitive model of choice that includes working memory operations. The proposal builds on the effort-accuracy approach to decision making and notes that there are individual differences in decision makers (e.g., in their aptitudes, working memory capacities, expertise, experience, etc.). Thus, shifts in information processing behavior may be a function of differences in capacity rather than a trade off between accuracy and effort.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Optimal Equation Formulation and Analysis for Simulation of MEMS</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Circuit simulators are often used to analyze non-electrical problems when it is noted that such a problem has an analogous electrical description. This is certainly the case for micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). But it should be noted that circuit simulators have been greatly optimized over the years for the analysis of large transistor circuits, and cannot be used to simulate MEMS designs. In fact, general purpose simulators, such as SCEPTRE, have fallen into disuse. This research explores the possibility of a MEMS-specific simulation tool, with a focus on the questions: 1. Is nodal formulation and traditional circuit simulation the best way to simulate MEMS? 2. If not, is the potential improvement significant enough to justify a specific tool? A prototype simulator in MATLAB is being built to demonstrate concepts. This borrows from prior work on circuit simulation. Applications of algorithms, such as Asymptotic Waveform Evaluation (AWE), and successive chords for nonlinear iteration, are being investigated for simulation of MEMS.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Exploring Image Data-Bases Using Novel Similarity Metrics</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Continued reductions in the prices of mass storage and widespread access to computer networks, especially the Internet, have given a large number of users access to vast amounts of information. Much of this information is pictorial, often ordinary images stored in digital form. Yet the tools available for organizing, browsing, and interrogating such image data have not kept pace with the volume of information made available. This research develops a novel way of summarizing and indexing images and other pictorial data based on their appearance, and more specifically on their color, shape, and texture content. These descriptors, called image signatures, are uniform, compact, flexible, robust, and intuitive. The notion of the Earth-Mover&apos;s Distance between signatures is introduced and used to give a metric structure to the image space. This metric structure, together with additional geometric information, is then exploited to provide efficient nearest-neighbor search algorithms, as well as to compute distance-preserving embeddings of the image space, or portions thereof, into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Such embeddings, obtained using multi-dimensional scaling, allow the user to visualize intuitively both local image neighborhoods of interest, or the entire image space at once. The user is able to navigate around the image space intuitively, with a sense of continuity and comprehensiveness, unlike current systems which typically present fragments of the data-base in a disconnected fashion. These tools then enable a novel metaphor for exploring image data- bases, making it more akin to the familiar browsing of a library or a bookstore.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS) initiative. The project is concerned with the intelligence exhibited in interactions among sensory-motor activities and cognitive capacities such as reasoning, planning and learning, in both organisms and machines. Such interaction is regularly shown in the act of navigation, which is engaged in by humans and other animals from an early age, and seems almost effortless in normal circumstances thereafter. Whatever there is in navigation that is innate and whatever is learned, it is important to try to understand the interaction of the various cognitive, perceptual, and motor systems that are involved. The complexity of these interactions becomes clear in the development of mobile robots, such as the one recently deployed on Mars, not to mention the more autonomous ones planned for the future. It is still a major and imperfectly understood task to create programs that will coordinate sensors, keep an internal emapn of the area, and allow the robot to cross a space efficiently and without collisions with obstacles. An interdisciplinary approach is being taken in this research project, exploring human capabilities through experiments, developing models based on the experimental results and what is already known about human navigation, implementing these models in programs for robot control, then testing these programs in robotic navigation experiments for their efficacy and their reasonableness as models of human navigation. The goals are both to understand the phenomena in humans and machines and to develop robust algorithms to be used in mobile robots. This alliance of researchers studying psychophysics, cognition, computation, and robotics will lead to gains in knowledge across many disciplines and will enhance our understanding of spatial cognition and visual navigation in agents, both artificial and natural.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS) Initiative. The project aims to advance understanding of how the brain generates intelligent behavior by examining the capacity to think about sequences of events. Whether cooking an elaborate meal or merely dialing a phone number, multiple events in a specific temporal order must be kept in mind, in a form of working memory that helps in planning complex thoughts and actions. This problem will be studied in the project through an interdisciplinary approach. To directly probe brain mechanisms, neurophysiological experiments will be performed on awake behaving animals. Computer-based experiments with young children will be used to discover how children learn sequential behaviors and to test how to optimize such learning. Behavioral studies will be done on how human infants learn sequences. Cognitive and neural modeling will be used to discover brain designs and mechanisms to link the animal neurophysiological data to the human cognitive data. This interdisciplinary approach promises to produce insights that are beyond the scope of any single approach. Conducting experiments in two different animal species (monkeys and rats), in human infants, and in young children will permit identification of intelligent mechanisms that are preserved across different species. The animal studies will analyse the activity of large groups of single neurons to study how multiple neurons interact to generate intelligent behaviors. Neural modeling will probe the laws that govern these behaviors, and will make predictions that link brain to behavior. Through these analyses of how we learn and remember sequences of events, a foundation will be built for studying the neural basis of high-level cognitive operations such as planning and reasoning; for developing better educational software; and for applying models towards the solution of outstanding technological problems that require algorithms which emulate human intelligence.</data>

Through these analyses of how we learn and remember sequences of events, a foundation will be built for studying the neural basis of high-level cognitive operations such as planning and reasoning; for developing better educational software; and for applying models towards the solution of outstanding technological problems that require algorithms which emulate human intelligence.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS) Initiative. The project aims to advance understanding of how the brain generates intelligent behavior by examining the capacity to think about sequences of events. Whether cooking an elaborate meal or merely dialing a phone number, multiple events in a specific temporal order must be kept in mind, in a form of working memory that helps in planning complex thoughts and actions. This problem will be studied in the project through an interdisciplinary approach. To directly probe brain mechanisms, neurophysiological experiments will be performed on awake behaving animals. Computer-based experiments with young children will be used to discover how children learn sequential behaviors and to test how to optimize such learning. Behavioral studies will be done on how human infants learn sequences. Cognitive and neural modeling will be used to discover brain designs and mechanisms to link the animal neurophysiological data to the human cognitive data. This interdisciplinary approach promises to produce insights that are beyond the scope of any single approach. Conducting experiments in two different animal species (monkeys and rats), in human infants, and in young children will permit identification of intelligent mechanisms that are preserved across different species.

      <data key="e_abstract">This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS) initiative. A key aim of this initiative is to understand how highly complex intelligent systems could arise from simple initial knowledge through interactions with the environment. The best real-world example of such a system is the human infant who progresses from relatively simple abilities at birth to quite sophisticated abilities by two-years-of-age. This research focuses on the development of reaching by infants because (a) only rudimentary reaching ability is present at birth; (b) older infants use their arms in a sophisticated way to exploit and explore the world; and (c) the problems facing the infant are similar to those an artificial system would face. The project brings together two computer scientists who are experts on learning control algorithms and neural networks, and two psychologists who are experts on the behavioral and neural aspects of infant reaching, to investigate and test various algorithms by which infants might gain control over their arms. The proposed research focuses on the control strategies that infants use in executing reaches, how infants develop appropriate and adaptive modes of reaching, the mechanisms by which infants improve their ability to reach with age, the role of sensory information in controlling the reach, and how such knowledge might be stored in psychologically appropriate and computationally powerful ways. Preliminary results suggest that computational models that are appropriate for modeling the development of human reaching are different in significant ways from traditional computational models. Understanding the mechanisms by which intelligence can develop through learning can have significant impact in many scientific and engineering domains because the ability to build such systems would be simpler and faster than engineering a system with the intelligence specified by the engineer and because systems based on interactive learning could rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9726118 Harrington, James Eason, Reginald NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Special Project: 7th Annual MU-SPIN Conference (1996) and Supplemental Support for on-campus Regional Training Workshop This interagency transfer purpose is to partially support a large conference and supplemental smaller workshops on high performance computing and communications and infrastructure development for minority institutions. NASA, through its National Space Science Data Center, has developed a program called the Minority University Space Interdisciplinary Network (MU-Spin). The program constitutes a major networking and education initiative for minority institutions, and other universities with large minority student enrollments. Connecting these institutions with the NASA Science Network, and promoting the activities such connections provide serve as primary goal of the program.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Capacity and Protocols for Integrated Voice/Data CDMA Systems</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The aim of this project is to develop an analytical framework that provides new understanding of the interaction of voice and data in an integrated voice/data CDMA system. The insights obtained from this study will be further used to develop new algorithms. The effect of the variability of data and its impact on the capacity and performance of the voice service in such a multimedia wireless system will be analyzed. New easily implemented real-time strategies for call admission, and control after call setup will be derived for the data service with delay sensitive voice being given priority. The effect of variable quality of service (QoS) the different classes of service may require will be included in the analysis framework and methodology. Further, the interaction between protocol layers will be included in the study and design of access control schemes for data. Specifically, we will analyze the interactions of end-to-end protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) with data access control schemes on the radio link. Analytical Methodology: Analysis of these problems encounters two serious difficulties. Even if all the information (e.g., distributions of relevant random variables) was available, exact analysis appears to be beyond current theory leading to computationally tractable solutions. Secondly, the needed distributions are often not available. We develop instead simple, reasonably accurate, analytic methodology which uses only means and variances, when appropriate, and distributional assumptions when necessary. Data Control Strategies: Recognizing that voice is delay sensitive, we develop data access control strategies. One type of real-time control is based on readily measurable quantities related to voice quality and uses broadcasted permission probabilities to the data users. The proposal will investigate the varied questions associated with the optimization of the data control algorithms. We will develop and analyze such control strategies for both conve ntional and multiuser receivers. Interaction between Protocol Layers : Serious problems can arise when protocol layers are designed independently but end up with unexpected interactions. We address this in the context of a data access control strategy operating under TCP. We investigate the problems due to such interactions and appropriate modifications in the light of the interactions. Significance of this Project: This project will provide a more complete understanding of the complex issues of voice/data integration. This will include development of analytical methodology which is convenient to use and consistent with the limited information expected to be available. New effective real-time algorithms will be developed for both conventional and multiuser receivers. Further, the study of the interactions between data link retransmission schemes and higher layer reliability protocols (like TCP) should provide valuable insights into system design for optimum coexistence of diverse traffic. The work will thus provide a better understanding of the complex interactions both between service types with different traffic characteristics and different QoS requirements, and between different protocol layers. This will lead to improved design of real-time algorithms for data.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This action executes a cooperative agreement between NSF and the National Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (NPACI) at the University of California - San Diego (UCSD), under the direction of Dr. Sid Karin via NSF award ASC 9619020. The cooperative agreement will be operational for a period of five years and is the result of a proposal submitted to NSF solicitation, &quot;Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infrastructure&quot; (PACI), NSF 96-31. The PACI program builds on and replaces the NSF Supercomputer Centers Program established in 1985 The program focuses on newly emerging opportunities in high performance computing and communications, providing flexibility, both to adapt to rapidly evolving circumstances and to meet the need for high-end computation, in order to enable continued U.S. world leadership in computational science and engineering. NSF, through this program, will provide access for researchers to high performance computing systems, with associated highly trained staff and researchers necessary to develop and optimize their use. The emergence of scalable parallel systems, high performance networking and high bandwidth and large capacity mass storage systems creates the opportunity for a national infrastructure consisting of a number of geographically distributed sites strongly coupled to high end computational resources and to each other via high speed communications networks. NPACI will lead the deployment and evolution of a national-scale metacomputing environment that will benefit the national user community in all fields of computational science and engineering. This infrastructure will integrate compute and data servers, and employ the talents of computer and computational scientists to guide its evolution. It will leverage the activities of many projects. The metacomputing environment will be extended to enable not only numerically intensive but also data-intensive computing. To that end, infrastructure will be developed and deployed to enable analysis of extremely large data collections from application output, remote-sensing and instrumentation-derived data, and data in widely scattered, discipline-specific databases. Three technology areas which are central to creating a metacomputing environment will initially be the basis for NPACI: Adaptable, Scalable Tools/Environments; Data-intensive Computing; and Interaction Environments. Several scientific applications have also been chosen that will motivate, guide, and validate development and integration of the NPACI infrastructure. Molecular Science, Neuroscience, Earth Systems Science, and Engineering will initially be focused on as areas ripe for scientific discovery and technology development. NPACI will integrate computational science and engineering education activities into the infrastructure, building on successful education and outreach efforts within the partnership. Particular emphasis will be placed on outreach to underrepresented minorities, women, and new communities. The Partnership will concentrate on providing advanced hardware, enabling technology, leading edge work in application technology, education, training and outreach. Included in this award is the first incremental payment to UCSD and its partners for FY98 which covers general operating expenses including equipment.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9720363 Stillings This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS) Initiative. to study tutorial interaction and learning outcomes in a feasible model of college-level inquiry-oriented instruction, as it is implemented in the Hampshire College science curriculum. This research will occur during the first two years. It will be conducted by Neil Stillings, Lawrence Winship, and a post-doctoral fellow in cognition and education, with the assistance of undergraduate research assistants and an outside educational research consultant. We will extend current intelligent multimedia tutoring technology to support college-level inquiry-oriented instruction. This research will involve the development of new software architectures to support inquiry in simulation environments and in integrated, computer-controlled laboratory environments. It will be conducted by Lee Spector, Beverly Woolf, Steven Weisler, and a post-doctoral fellow in computer science, with some additional involvement from Neil Stillings and Lawrence Winship. We will demonstrate our extensions of educational software technology by developing three college-level inquiry-oriented software packages in the biological and cognitive sciences. Our plan is to produce one application in the language sciences, one in the environmental sciences, and one in human biology. These applications will be classroom-ready and suitable for use outside the research context. The primary developers will be Lee Spector, Steven Weisler, a post-doctoral fellow in computer science, a professional programmer, and graduate assistants in computer science. They will work with faculty members in the appropriate disciplines. The original plan was to develop six applications rather than three. The budget has been reduced accordingly. At least two of the software applications will be tested at Hampshire, and at least one of them will be revised to reflect the testing results. The classroom testing involves an important feature of the proposed software architectures, which will have built-in educational and psychological measurement capabilities. The primary researchers for the software testing phase of the project are Neil Stillings, Beverly Woolf, the post- doctoral fellow in cognition and education, and an outside educational consultant. The original proposal also involved the introduction and testing of software at the University of Massachusetts. That aspect of the proposal has been dropped and the budget reduced accordingly.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9720363 Stillings This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS) Initiative. to study tutorial interaction and learning outcomes in a feasible model of college-level inquiry-oriented instruction, as it is implemented in the Hampshire College science curriculum. This research will occur during the first two years. It will be conducted by Neil Stillings, Lawrence Winship, and a post-doctoral fellow in cognition and education, with the assistance of undergraduate research assistants and an outside educational research consultant. We will extend current intelligent multimedia tutoring technology to support college-level inquiry-oriented instruction. This research will involve the development of new software architectures to support inquiry in simulation environments and in integrated, computer-controlled laboratory environments. It will be conducted by Lee Spector, Beverly Woolf, Steven Weisler, and a post-doctoral fellow in computer science, with some additional involvement from Neil Stillings and Lawrence Winship. We will demonstrate our extensions of educational software technology by developing three college-level inquiry-oriented software packages in the biological and cognitive sciences. Our plan is to produce one application in the language sciences, one in the environmental sciences, and one in human biology. These applications will be classroom-ready and suitable for use outside the research context. The primary developers will be Lee Spector, Steven Weisler, a post-doctoral fellow in computer science, a professional programmer, and graduate assistants in computer science. They will work with faculty members in the appropriate disciplines. The original plan was to develop six applications rather than three. The budget has been reduced accordingly. At least two of the software applications will be tested at Hampshire, and at least one of them will be revised to reflect the testing results. The classroom testing involves an important feature of the proposed software architectures, which will have built-in educational and psychological measurement capabilities. The primary researchers for the software testing phase of the project are Neil Stillings, Beverly Woolf, the post- doctoral fellow in cognition and education, and an outside educational consultant. The original proposal also involved the introduction and testing of software at the University of Massachusetts. That aspect of the proposal has been dropped and the budget reduced accordingly.</data>

It will be conducted by Lee Spector, Beverly Woolf, Steven Weisler, and a post-doctoral fellow in computer science, with some additional involvement from Neil Stillings and Lawrence Winship. We will demonstrate our extensions of educational software technology by developing three college-level inquiry-oriented software packages in the biological and cognitive sciences. Our plan is to produce one application in the language sciences, one in the environmental sciences, and one in human biology. These applications will be classroom-ready and suitable for use outside the research context. The primary developers will be Lee Spector, Steven Weisler, a post-doctoral fellow in computer science, a professional programmer, and graduate assistants in computer science. They will work with faculty members in the appropriate disciplines. The original plan was to develop six applications rather than three. The budget has been reduced accordingly. At least two of the software applications will be tested at Hampshire, and at least one of them will be revised to reflect the testing results. The classroom testing involves an important feature of the proposed software architectures, which will have built-in educational and psychological measurement capabilities. The primary researchers for the software testing phase of the project are Neil Stillings, Beverly Woolf, the post- doctoral fellow in cognition and education, and an outside educational consultant. The original proposal also involved the introduction and testing of software at the University of Massachusetts. That aspect of the proposal has been dropped and the budget reduced accordingly.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9720359 Kurt Van Lehn University of Pittsburgh CIRCLE: Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Constructive Learning Environments The Center has three main goals. First, the Center seeks to understand an extremely effective pedagogy, human tutoring. This will be achieved by using protocol analysis, eye tracking and controlled experiments to study human tutors and contrast them to existing computer tutors. The overarching hypothesis is that students learn best when they construct knowledge for themselves. The second goal of the Center is to build and test new generation of computer tutoring systems that encourage students to construct the target knowledge instead of telling it to them. The student&apos;s self-construction may need to be delicately guided via prompting, Socratic questioning or other means, This goal will be achieved by adding advanced planning and natural language components to existing intelligent tutoring systems and testing the new tutors in collaborating schools. The Center&apos;s third goal is to help integrate this new technology into existing educational practices. This goal will be achieved by working with practitioners and schools throughout the development process, by upgrading tutors that are already in use by thousands of students, and by forming partnerships with other projects, centers and industries. Achieving the three Center goals will impact multiple disciplines. Understanding why human tutors are so effective should have a significant impact on the psychology of learning. Computer science will be advanced by developing systems that can reactively plan natural language hints and questions that get a student to learn. Education will be improved as the Center&apos;s constructivist technology and instructional methods prove to be effective in actual use and become widely available.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9720384 SRI International Roy D. Pea Learning and Intelligent Systems: Center for Innovative Learning Technologies The Center for Innovative Technologies (CILT) stimulates the development and implementation of important, technology-enabled solutions to critical problems in K-14 science, mathematics, engineering, and technology learning. Four institutions-SRI International; the University of California at Berkeley; Vanderbilt University; and the Concord Consortium-provide Center leadership and infrastructure. &quot;Theme teams&quot; conduct the Center&apos;s research, development, and implementation activities. Participants drawn both from the founding organizations and from elsewhere will represent the best possible mix of expertise. Theme teams will include computer scientists and engineers; experts in science, mathematics and engineering instruction, policy, and research; and industry leaders. Participants will work together in national workshops and on-line discussions to review their research results, identify critical challenges and potential breakthroughs in their theme area, and select prototype collaborative projects for CILT sponsorship. These prototype projects serve as&quot;seed&quot; efforts that,can transform the use of learning technologies in education.

Schools in Chicago and Detroit are currently developing and implementing new curriculum frameworks, new standards and practices for professional development, and new community-based structures that support teaching and learning in classrooms. The Center will capitalize on these efforts and on research at Northwestern University and the University of Michigan to develop models of science learning based on science practice, modeling and simulation, scientific visualization, and tools for computer-supported collaboration that can enrich urban schools. The Center will encourage schools to create challenging implementations for learning technologies, and support the schools in such endeavors.. Teams of teachers and researchers will work to understand how to make new technologies work in urban and non-urban communities across the nation. The result of the Center&apos;s efforts will be new technologies, and improved school organizations that are better structured to facilitate the adoption of new technology and rigorous, new science curricula.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9720377 Reiser In this 36 month project, the PIs develop an Instructional model of reflective inquiry, including a description of the cognitive strategies that comprise reflective activity in scientific inquire and principles for their instruction. The project also develops software and curriculum that will enable the investigation and evaluation of this instructional model in real-world classrooms. The instructional model accounts for the following elements: cognitive strategies for reflection, strategic timing and initiation of strategy use, and beliefs that support reflection. It provides a framework for designing supports for reflection through social structures, tools, and artifacts. The model is used to guide the design of an inquiry-support environment called the Progress Portfolio, which will work in conjunction with third-party investigation software. The Progress Portfolio provides support for reflection by giving students mechanisms for turning their work products and processes into explicit objects for reflection. Ongoing empirical studies with the software and curriculum will lead to improvements in the design of the software and curriculum and refinement of the instructional model.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">HRD-9711504 Beckman In recent years, through a variety of programs, the Houston Community College System (HCCS) has established a number of efforts designed to recruit and retain women, minorities, and students with disabilities. Despite the successes of such programs, the number of minority students completing their studies and transferring to senior colleges and universities falls far short of the nation s growing need for minorities trained in computer technologies. The faculty of the Houston Community College System Computer Science Department has planned a broad, ambitious program to attract more students from underrepresented groups to careers in computer science. Using successful models, the plan focuses on building an infrastructure of faculty and student support systems which will assure promising potential scholars an outstanding educational program and secure their entry into senior colleges and universities. Our proposed program will touch every sector of the college system and reach into the community we serve. The primary goal of the program is to increase the number of students from all underrepresented groups in the field of computer science, assist them to successfully complete their studies at the Houston Community College system, and facilitate their entry into a senior college or university. Underlying this goal is the intent to foster a fundamental change of philosophy throughout the Houston Community College System and the entire community. The comprehensive plan we have developed provides for the building of an infrastructure that will prepare faculty and students for the speed of technological change. The plan will require an infusion of upgraded hardware and software to help faculty prepare for these changes by revising and updating the curriculum yearly to meet the program s needs, to train faculty in current technical advances, and to meet the instructional needs of students brought into the program. The full program provides for re cruiting and retaining promising students from underrepresented groups who are interested in pursuing careers in computer science. The plan includes pre-college training, two-year training and education at the college level, and retention support programs such as tutoring, mentoring, counseling, and appropriate financial support.</data>

Underlying this goal is the intent to foster a fundamental change of philosophy throughout the Houston Community College System and the entire community. The comprehensive plan we have developed provides for the building of an infrastructure that will prepare faculty and students for the speed of technological change. The plan will require an infusion of upgraded hardware and software to help faculty prepare for these changes by revising and updating the curriculum yearly to meet the program s needs, to train faculty in current technical advances, and to meet the instructional needs of students brought into the program. The full program provides for re cruiting and retaining promising students from underrepresented groups who are interested in pursuing careers in computer science. The plan includes pre-college training, two-year training and education at the college level, and retention support programs such as tutoring, mentoring, counseling, and appropriate financial support.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This research program will address the high-performance parallel simulation of multiphysics problems that couple dynamic models in fluid mechanics, heat transfer, structures and control. This program requires the close collaboration of researchers in engineering, computer science and computational mathematics. The activities in Engineering are driven by the simulation, on high performance parallel computers, of problems involving the dynamic interaction of physical models from disciplines of importance in aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering. Four specific applications of this class of problems will be considered: the mitigation of turbulent vorticity in high-temperature engines; the study of high turbulent flow in pipe bends, the use of active and semi-active control to safeguard composite structures in civil and aerospace engineering; and the implementation of topology/shape structural design and optimization for aeroelastic design. These application are unified by their multidisciplinary nature which involves at least two mechanical fields, use of a common basis in modeling, visualization, problem decomposition, parallel simulation methodology, and software/hardware infrastructure. The research in Computer Science will focus on the development of a problem Solving Environment (PSE) for the applications problems which is suitable for the parallel implementation of large-scale multiphysics simulations. The primary goal of the PSE is to provide transparent, portable and scalable access to all of the resources needed for execution of large parallel applications on heterogeneous and/or distributed systems, including interprocessor communication, access to disk, visualization, debugging and performance monitoring. The following application s of the PSE will be investigated: network-based distributed object systems, distributed shared memory systems, parallel persistent I/O, and computational steering and debugging. In addition we propose to integrate quality of service protocols in high-speed networks with our distributed object system to provide a true real-time distributed environment, and to investigate numerical algorithms for optimal memory access using the PSE to facilitate distributed performance analysis. The application problems are interconnected in modeling, computational and software integration aspects, facilitating the common use of tools such as domain decomposers and response visualization. This project will provide unique opportunities for the training of students and postdocs in an interdisciplinary setting. Regular weekly meetings of the full research group will introduce all researchers to the breadth of issues involved and will allow students to locate suitable thesis topics. Students will be encouraged to have advisors from two disciplinary areas represented by the research team, and each student will be paired with a postdoctoral student as a mentor.</data>

Four specific applications of this class of problems will be considered: the mitigation of turbulent vorticity in high-temperature engines; the study of high turbulent flow in pipe bends, the use of active and semi-active control to safeguard composite structures in civil and aerospace engineering; and the implementation of topology/shape structural design and optimization for aeroelastic design. These application are unified by their multidisciplinary nature which involves at least two mechanical fields, use of a common basis in modeling, visualization, problem decomposition, parallel simulation methodology, and software/hardware infrastructure. The research in Computer Science will focus on the development of a problem Solving Environment (PSE) for the applications problems which is suitable for the parallel implementation of large-scale multiphysics simulations. The primary goal of the PSE is to provide transparent, portable and scalable access to all of the resources needed for execution of large parallel applications on heterogeneous and/or distributed systems, including interprocessor communication, access to disk, visualization, debugging and performance monitoring. The following application s of the PSE will be investigated: network-based distributed object systems, distributed shared memory systems, parallel persistent I/O, and computational steering and debugging. In addition we propose to integrate quality of service protocols in high-speed networks with our distributed object system to provide a true real-time distributed environment, and to investigate numerical algorithms for optimal memory access using the PSE to facilitate distributed performance analysis. The application problems are interconnected in modeling, computational and software integration aspects, facilitating the common use of tools such as domain decomposers and response visualization. This project will provide unique opportunities for the training of students and postdocs in an interdisciplinary setting. Regular weekly meetings of the full research group will introduce all researchers to the breadth of issues involved and will allow students to locate suitable thesis topics. Students will be encouraged to have advisors from two disciplinary areas represented by the research team, and each student will be paired with a postdoctoral student as a mentor.</data>

      <data key="e_title">A Scalable and Robust Multicast Architecture for the Internet</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">A critical challenge for development of the Internet is how to support efficient and effective multicast communication in response to the intense pace of growth of the Internet and the concomitant demand for communication services from its users. Current multicast protocols, while well-suited to local or smaller scale communication, have suffered from serious shortcomings with respect to scalability, stability, and inter-domain coordination. Our approach to the multicast routing problem involves the introduction of new graph theoretic structures as underlying abstract communication topologies for multicast and the integration of these new structures with current technologies. There are two key elements to our new multicast architecture: a) 3-layer hierarchical multicast protocol and b) a virtual topologies model. Together these two elements provide a flexible architecture for multicast that has the potential to overcome the shortcomings described above. In this proposal, we focus on the virtual topologies element of the architecture. Certain graph structures have great potential to serve as underlying topologies for multicast communication, due to properties of connectivity, symmetry, limited vertex degree, and small diameter. Under the proposed model, an abstract communication topology, such as the k-tree or the k-ary n-cube, is used as basis for the execution and routing of the multicast protocols. The mapping of the virtual topology to physical routes in the Internet occurs dynamically, as is done under current, shared-tree approaches to multicasting. More robust topologies can be expected to provide greater flexibility and fault tolerance than simple tree structures. Scalability comes from the fact that these virtual topologies are limited to intradomain application. Our proposed 3-level, hierarchical multicast protocol follows the Internet domain structure, interconnecting domain-specific virtual topologies into an overall multicast structure. We plan to develop new pr otocols for multicast under the architectural model described above and to test their feasibility and performance through simulation. Our interdisciplinary team of researchers in graph theory, parallel computing, and networking brings a new synergy to the multicast problem. Our theoretic work will be guided by an understanding of the pragmatic issues involved in today&apos;s Internet protocols. We hope to define and develop fundamental new multicast structures and algorithms that can ultimately serve as the foundations for a realistic, effective multicast architecture for the Internet.</data>

There are two key elements to our new multicast architecture: a) 3-layer hierarchical multicast protocol and b) a virtual topologies model. Together these two elements provide a flexible architecture for multicast that has the potential to overcome the shortcomings described above. In this proposal, we focus on the virtual topologies element of the architecture. Certain graph structures have great potential to serve as underlying topologies for multicast communication, due to properties of connectivity, symmetry, limited vertex degree, and small diameter. Under the proposed model, an abstract communication topology, such as the k-tree or the k-ary n-cube, is used as basis for the execution and routing of the multicast protocols. The mapping of the virtual topology to physical routes in the Internet occurs dynamically, as is done under current, shared-tree approaches to multicasting. More robust topologies can be expected to provide greater flexibility and fault tolerance than simple tree structures. Scalability comes from the fact that these virtual topologies are limited to intradomain application. Our proposed 3-level, hierarchical multicast protocol follows the Internet domain structure, interconnecting domain-specific virtual topologies into an overall multicast structure. We plan to develop new pr otocols for multicast under the architectural model described above and to test their feasibility and performance through simulation. Our interdisciplinary team of researchers in graph theory, parallel computing, and networking brings a new synergy to the multicast problem. Our theoretic work will be guided by an understanding of the pragmatic issues involved in today&apos;s Internet protocols. We hope to define and develop fundamental new multicast structures and algorithms that can ultimately serve as the foundations for a realistic, effective multicast architecture for the Internet.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Ultra-Low Rate Progressive Coding of Images</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Algorithms for progressive image compression seek to represent an image in such a way that a small fraction of the data file can allow a displayed image to be recognizable, and a larger portion of the data allows improved image quality. The main applications of progressive image compression are for browsing of remote databases, Internet image hopping, and fast remote decision-making tasks where many images must be scanned. The goal is to compress images to rates so low as to yield &quot;just-recognizable&quot; quality. The user can then exploit just- recognizable images while progressively scanning an image database by &quot;quitting&quot; each image as soon as it is determined not to be the one sought. This research involves theoretical understanding of ultra-low rate progressive image coding both with and without channel noise, as well as the development and evaluation of practical algorithms for applications such as low-bandwidth video compression and packet network image transmission. One portion of this research focuses on algorithm development, including optimization of wavelet zerotree coding for ultra-low rates, and coding using regions or line caricatures. The investigators are studying the effect of channel noise on progressive coding systems, and are developing both grayscale and color bit progressive image coding algorithms that do not exhibit catastrophic breakdown in the presence of channel noise. One promising approach uses rate compatible punctured convolution codes applied to images compressed with a wavelet zerotree method. Experimental studies of response times for human observers of progressive image coders will allow the researchers to quantitatively compare one progressive image coder against another, and yield insight into human perceptual responses to just-recognizable imagery.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS) initiative. It is concerned with learning that is incremental in nature, resulting in skills that improve over time. Such learning is responsible for the development of perceptual discriminations, stimulus associations, and motor skills, and is seen in both humans and animals. The goal of the research is a systems-level neural theory of incremental learning. The project combines computer simulations with neurophysiological recording from the brains of behaving rats and monkeys, functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans, and robotic implementation. It is known that many parts of the mammalian brain contribute to incremental learning. Although the cortex may play a central role, other brain areas known to make vital contributions include the basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebellum. It is important to understand the roles of these various areas and their interactions with each other during learning. Experimental work to be performed includes recording from various areas of the brains of rats and monkeys during learning and imaging the brains of humans performing analogous tasks. Models of neural function will be developed based on the monkey experiments and will be implemented on a mobile robot. These implemented models will allow the training of the robot, and a comparison of the learning that takes place with that observed in humans and animals. The development of theories of incremental learning will provide a better understanding of how the process occurs and may result in improved approaches to the development of skills in both humans and machines.</data>

      <data key="e_title">The Biological Basis of Incremental Learning</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS) initiative. It is concerned with learning that is incremental in nature, resulting in skills that improve over time. Such learning is responsible for the development of perceptual discriminations, stimulus associations, and motor skills, and is seen in both humans and animals. The goal of the research is a systems-level neural theory of incremental learning. The project combines computer simulations with neurophysiological recording from the brains of behaving rats and monkeys, functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans, and robotic implementation. It is known that many parts of the mammalian brain contribute to incremental learning. Although the cortex may play a central role, other brain areas known to make vital contributions include the basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebellum. It is important to understand the roles of these various areas and their interactions with each other during learning. Experimental work to be performed includes recording from various areas of the brains of rats and monkeys during learning and imaging the brains of humans performing analogous tasks. Models of neural function will be developed based on the monkey experiments and will be implemented on a mobile robot. These implemented models will allow the training of the robot, and a comparison of the learning that takes place with that observed in humans and animals. The development of theories of incremental learning will provide a better understanding of how the process occurs and may result in improved approaches to the development of skills in both humans and machines.</data>

      <data key="e_title">CRHCT: New Ultrasonic Techniques for Managing Kidney Disease</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9708221 Insana Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) techniques are to be developed to detect early changes in renal microstructure that ultimately lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). QUS involves analysis of echo spectra in frequency channels corresponding to scattering from various anatomical scales to measure the size, number density, and collagen content of essential tissue microstructures. These are among the first techniques for analyzing histological properties of tissues in vivo and noninvasively. The incidence of ESRD in the United States is increasing geometrically. Average medicare costs were $46,117 per ESRD patient for a total of $9.5 billion in 1992. A definitive diagnosis of progressive injury leading to ESRD is now based on clinical findings and biopsy; that often occur late in the disease process. Currently no test exists to establish the presence of early kidney injury or to identify populations at risk for whom prevention of progressive injury should be attempted. This investigation will examine the potential of QUS as a safe, inexpensive, and noninvasive method for early detection of renal injury caused by several common conditions including diabetes, hypertension, and cystic kidney disease. This three-year, multidisciplinary research project aims to develop new biomedical instrumentation, experimental techniques, and models of disease processes. If QUS can successfully identify patients at risk for ESRD, the potential to prevent disease would be improved, the net cost of treating the disease would be reduced significantly, and the quality of life for those patients affected would be improved. This research program is part of a new graduate-level Biomedical Engineering Program at the University of Kansas. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">ABSTRACT: NCR9725292 National Laboratory for Applied Networking Research (NLANR): Distributed Applications Support Team (DAST) In 1995, NSF awarded a cooperative agreement for a National Laboratory for Applied Networking Research (NLANR) providing for engineering, technical support and coordination of the vBNS connections at the supercomputing centers. The purposes of this NLANR team activity were (i) to provide sufficient testing, utilization and measurement of the NSFvBNS to insure that its overall performance was at acceptable levels, (ii) to facilitate the experiments to be performed on the NSFvBNS, and (iii) to provide for the coordination of support activities among the centers. It also provided limited engineering and technical support for general use of the NSFvBNS and provided for the coordination of such activities and facilitated the development at the supercomputing centers of a skilled and distributed network engineering team with a thorough knowledge of the NSFvBNS and its performance capabilities and use for high performance applications. The recently initiated expansion of the NSFvBNS to encourage its use as a &quot;leading edge but stable&quot; platform to enable the development and use of high performance applications by the broader academic research community requires that the original NLANR activities be significantly expanded to encompass support for new users, sites and applications as well as continued measurement and testing of an expanded network. The need for this expansion has defined the NLANR activity into separate awards for three functional areas: the NLANR: Distributed Applications Support Team (DAST), located at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaigne, aimed at assisting the end users of high-performance applications in maximizing the performance of their applications; the NLANR: National Center for Network Engineering (NCNE), located at Carnegie-Mellon University, aimed at assisting high performance connections campuses in optimizing their network engineeri ng and connectivity; and the NLANR: Measurement and Operational Analysis Team (MOAT), located at the University of California, San, Diego, aimed at measuring and optimizing performance and use of the NSFvBNS and interconnected networks. The three efforts will continue to be be closely coodinated with each other and with the NSFvBNS. The agreement provides for the NLANR: Distributed Applications Support Team (DAST) which builds on the NLANR activity and brings to bear NCSA&apos;s experience in supporting users of both high performance networks (through NLANR, IWAY, BLANCA, etc.) and complex computing environments (through the NCSA user support structure that serves several thousand users). DAST will place network and software engineers in direct contact with users, develop training materials and the host workshops to facilitate the transfer of expertise in supporting applications to the High Performance Connections end users and user service organizations at their institutions. DAST establishes a central help desk for High Performance Connection award site users with high performance applications to coordinate the routing and resolution of problems related to the vBNS and other networks associated with the High Performance Connections program.</data>

It also provided limited engineering and technical support for general use of the NSFvBNS and provided for the coordination of such activities and facilitated the development at the supercomputing centers of a skilled and distributed network engineering team with a thorough knowledge of the NSFvBNS and its performance capabilities and use for high performance applications. The recently initiated expansion of the NSFvBNS to encourage its use as a &quot;leading edge but stable&quot; platform to enable the development and use of high performance applications by the broader academic research community requires that the original NLANR activities be significantly expanded to encompass support for new users, sites and applications as well as continued measurement and testing of an expanded network. The need for this expansion has defined the NLANR activity into separate awards for three functional areas: the NLANR: Distributed Applications Support Team (DAST), located at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaigne, aimed at assisting the end users of high-performance applications in maximizing the performance of their applications; the NLANR: National Center for Network Engineering (NCNE), located at Carnegie-Mellon University, aimed at assisting high performance connections campuses in optimizing their network engineeri ng and connectivity; and the NLANR: Measurement and Operational Analysis Team (MOAT), located at the University of California, San, Diego, aimed at measuring and optimizing performance and use of the NSFvBNS and interconnected networks. The three efforts will continue to be be closely coodinated with each other and with the NSFvBNS. The agreement provides for the NLANR: Distributed Applications Support Team (DAST) which builds on the NLANR activity and brings to bear NCSA&apos;s experience in supporting users of both high performance networks (through NLANR, IWAY, BLANCA, etc.) and complex computing environments (through the NCSA user support structure that serves several thousand users). DAST will place network and software engineers in direct contact with users, develop training materials and the host workshops to facilitate the transfer of expertise in supporting applications to the High Performance Connections end users and user service organizations at their institutions. DAST establishes a central help desk for High Performance Connection award site users with high performance applications to coordinate the routing and resolution of problems related to the vBNS and other networks associated with the High Performance Connections program.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9729844 Allen, Peter Columbia University CISE Research Instrumentation: Acquisition of a Mobile Robot Scanning System This research instrumentation grant contributes to the purchase of a mobile robot scanning system, comprised of a an outdoor, autonomous robot vehicle with a large payload and an on-board centimeter resolution Global Positioning System for accurate location of the vehicle. The instrumentation will enable the following projects:- Automatic 3-D Site Modeling,- Automated Visual Navigation,- Integration of Physical and Virtual Views, and- Optimal Representation and Verbal Description of Large Scale Objects and Path. The mobile scanning equipment acquired will contribute to develop highly accurate 3-D site models that encompass geometric and photometric properties of the scene. There are 4 aspects to this research which require a mobile base robot, an accurate GPS location system, and 2-D and 3-D imaging sensors. First, the models will be built by using the mobile base to acquire images and a new range scan mesh extrusion algorithm will create volumetric models. Sensor planning algorithms will also be developed to determine regions where the robot can navigate to complete a partially built model by further sensing. Second, the robot will be equipped with omnidirectional cameras which can be used for structure-from-motion scene recovery, and model registration research. Third, the system will be used for research on change detection and model evolution on existing models of the environment. The GPS system can provide ground truth for the accuracy of these algorithms, and allow interaction with an existing low-precision human-mounted system for tracking. Fourth, the system will be used as a &quot;guide&quot; through an environment. It can take navigational and environmental queries in verbal/gestural form, and present its findings about the objects of interest in the scene in natural language.</data>

Digital Signal Processors are commonly used to execute a range of performance-critical signal processing applications. High-level language compilers have only recently been targeted for DSPs. The optimization technology provided in these compilers lacks the level of sophistication commonly found in most microprocessor compilers, and has discouraged the use of high-level languages for performance-critical DSP applications.

New code generation technologies must be developed which capitalize both on the characteristics of signal processing algorithms and on the resources available in modern DSPs. Compiler technologies that exploit the evolving architectural features present in state-of-the-art signal processors must also be used to develop highly performance-tuned signal processing applications.

      <data key="e_abstract">9729990 Teller, Patricia J. The University of Texas at El Paso CISE Research Instrumentation: A Multiprocessor Platform for Cross-Disciplinary Research in Parallel Systems This research instrumentation enables the following research projects:- Dynamic and Adaptive Multiprocessor Resource Management, - Run-Time Monitoring of Parallel Programs, and- A Parallel Implementation of SequenceL Programs. To support the aforementioned projects, the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) will purchase additional processors and memory, a star router to interconnect them, a DLT autochanger, a spare hot-swappable hard drive, and software to upgrade their SGI/Cray Origin 2000. The upgraded multiprocessor system provides a platform that builds upon funded-research efforts and creates new cross-disciplinary research opportunities in the area of parallel systems. The system supports research in computer and information science and engineering, in particular, research in: end-to-end performance modeling of large, heterogeneous, adaptive parallel/distributed computer/communication systems; dynamic and adaptive multiprocessor resource management; run-time monitoring of sequential and parallel programs; and very high-level parallel programming languages for data mining applications. This research is significant because it addresses important performance issues with respect to the design of future parallel architectures, in particular, the memory hierarchy of these systems; the feasibility of run-time monitoring of the integrity of software; and the effectiveness of mining large databases. The research requires, and the system provides, the ability to: characterize process resource demands, measure application performance, acquire parameters for multiprocessor system modeling, validate multiprocessor simulations, and perform parallel discrete event simulation. With these methods, it is possible to evaluate the performance of dynamic and adaptive multiprocessor resource management policies; various implementations of integrity-constraint monitoring, in particular, concurrent processes; and very high-level programming constructs.</data>

WINLAB (Wireless Information Network Laboratory),Rutgers University CISE Research Instrumentation: Parallel Computing For Wireless Networking Research This research instrumentation grant enables the following research projects: - Scalable Simulations of Telecommunication Systems- Interference and Coexistence of U-NII Band Wireless Systems - Routing and Power Control in Multihop Packet Radio Networks - Interference Cancellation. WINLAB, an NSF/Industry Cooperative Research Center, will purchase a high performance 14-processor SMP computer (SUN UltraSparc HPC 4000) to support computation-intensive research projects in wireless data networking which exhibit considerable degree of untapped parallelism. The new and ongoing projects that critically depend on such a computing platform include:- Development of a Virtual Wireless Testbed for parallel simulations of radio propagation, mobility, network traffic and protocols. The Testbed evolves to become a standard research and education tool.- Investigations of interference and robust protocols for the wireless systems in the recently allocated 5 GHz bands for the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII).- Investigations of power control and feasible routing schemes in multihop radio networks.- Design of a testbed implementing sophisticated multiuser detectors for new CDMA systems. The purchase of the multiprocessor SUN UltraSparc will greatly accelerate research in these areas, as well as in other projects involving DIMACS (an NSF S&amp;T Center) and ECE and CS Departments at Rutgers, which currently do not have a comparable high performance multiprocessor with parallel thread support.</data>

      <data key="e_title">&quot;Scalable Audio Compression for Multimedia Applications&quot;</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Scalable signal compression algorithms are required by the evolving communication network, which is composed of a variety of channels with widely differing static and dynamic capacities, and by the recent trend toward incremental capacity and bandwidth reservation channels. Current multimedia compression algorithms implicitly assume simple point to point transmission as well as fixed bandwidth allocation, and result in under-utilization of the network resources. The development of truly scalable coders with rate controlled by the local source statistics, network traffic load, and channel condition will directly impact the next generation of audio internetworking for multicasting, videotelephone, videoteleconferencing, and various applications for information retrieval from multimedia databases. This research focuses on new audio compression techniques for voice and music signals, that allow efficient scaling of bit rate and audio bandwidth within the framework of multimedia compression. The primary thrust centers on audio signal modeling with a sinusoidal signal representation, which is bandwidth and rate scalable and achieves good performance in a variety of coding environments from low-rate coding of narrow-band speech (2 kb/s) to high-quality coding of audio signals (16-64 kb/s). Methods under investigation include sophisticated phonetic and music classification to allow content-adaptive audio decomposition and modeling, generalized product code vector quantization, and in particular, multi- stage vector quantization, to implement scalable quantization techniques. Inter- stream optimization for joint compression of audio and video signals is studied with emphasis on potential applicability to packet transmission and in particular to TCP/IP Internet protocols. An important sub-problem is the inter-stream rate allocation optimization taking into account each stream&apos;s level of activity, user requirements, and sensitivity to quantization and channel errors. Sourc e-channel coding and error concealment issues are studied in order to maintain quality of service requirements under packet losses for both wired and wireless channels.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Real agents must work within the limitations (bounds) imposed by their own makeup. Among the resources available only in limited quantities are time, space, and information. This project is to study the rational utilization of limited resources in reasoning. Specifically, the tasks will be: (1) to devise and implement a treatment of reasoning in bounded agents embedded in a rich environment, paying special attention to their planning, reasoning about action, and resolution of conflicting information, using the formalism of active logic; (b) to focus on the application of the above to web agents and their autonomous time management (planning and scheduling) in order to meet user requests; (c) to continue the development of a standard logic engine; and (4) to develop a computationally attractive syntactic account of propositional attitudes, including belief, desire, and attention. The results of the research will allow the development of bounded web agents based on a firm theoretical foundation.</data>
