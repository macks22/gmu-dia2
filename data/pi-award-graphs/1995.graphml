      <data key="e_abstract">9503994 Samet One of the emerging areas of research is the integration of databases containing nontraditional data with conventional databases. New indexing methods are required in order to store and retrieve nontraditional data efficiently. These methods must capture the nature of the data and sort on this information. In this research the methods for integrating symbolic images into relational database systems will be extended to a more general case of images. The problem is how to match the stored image with an observed image that is presented to the database as a query, but is taken from a different viewpoint. A solution based on utilizing methods that are used in computer vision to solve these problems, and integrating these results into a relational (or any other) database system will be investigated. The solution is based on the use of geometric invariants. An additional research goal that extends this work into other nontraditional data types such as video data will also be performed. As video is becoming a common data type in information systems, data management systems should support this new kind of data. The important issue is how to extract contextual, spatial and temporal information from the video sequences in order to index on video data based on its contents. A solution that is based on gathering information about methods that are used for this purpose in computer vision, and adapting them so they can be used in the framework of database systems will be outlined. In particular, using a system the recognizes facial expressions from video sequences of a human face is suggested as a testbed. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">IRI-9503366 Whitley, L. Darrell Colorado State University $90,000 - 12 mos. Comparisons and Applications of Local and Global Search This is first year finding for a three year continuing grant. Scientists and engineers seeking practical ways to solve difficult combinatorial optimization problems are increasingly turning to local search and genetic algorithms. In addition, the past five years has seen a dramatic increase in researchers proposing new variants on these techniques, especially genetic algorithms. Recent work on genetic algorithms has strongly suggested the best algorithms interweave local search and genetic search techniques. This research has four main objectives: 1) produce a suite of local search methods and stochastic hill-climbing algorithms to test the difficulty of optimization problems, 2) produce a new test suite of complex problems which are resistant to local search and stochastic hill-climbing, 3) produce new hybridized genetic algorithms that can be sued to produce state-of-the-art results for applications in computer vision and geophysics, 4) conduct comparative studies of the major genetic algorithm search paradigms, including hybrids which utilize local search. In pursuit of this fourth objective, it will be necessary to compare different genetic algorithms, local search algorithms, and hybrids on both the controlled test suite of problems as well as large problems of practical importance.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">IRI-9509771 Ford, Kenneth M., and Canas, Alberto J. University of West Florida $5,000-12 mos. Workshop: Smart Machines and Education: Perils and Promise This is partial funding for a workshop that is bringing together participants from a variety of disciplines that share an interest in how artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive science might serve as an enabling technology for learning. Additionally, some of the participants are interested in using what we have learned about intelligence itself (some of this from AI and cognitive models on computers) to build machines that support the learning process. Education is fast ceasing to be a child&apos;s preparation for adulthood and is becoming a lifelong process. Certainly, computers and communication will be at the center of this evolution. But beyond merely providing the interface, testing, and delivery component, what role can the specific `intelligent` capacities built into a machine play? This will be the central question that underlies the meeting&apos;s sessions on intelligent machine interaction, adaptivity, individual and group process es, and embedding of smart machines in the social milieu. The workshop is intended to help build disciplinary bridges and establish research and development agendas.</data>

      <data key="e_title">A Testbed for Collaborative Interactive Remote Instruction</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9552593 Maly Building on its expertise in networking, computer supported collaborative work, and remote learning, Old Dominion University will prepare to build a statewide highly Interactive Remote Instruction (IRI) testbed based on networked workstations. Technology and pedagogical methods developed in testbed will be integrated into TELETECHNET, a state funded program in which Old Dominion University and community colleges will provide four-year programs. The first two years will be taught at the community colleges with the last two being provided by Old Dominion University to remote community college campuses via networked and televised course instructions. The project will consist of a one- year preparatory phase, covered by this proposal, and a three-year phase of research, development, and implementation to be covered by a follow-on proposal. Significant contributions of the proposed one-year project include: 1) refining an existing IRI prototype to provide an open-ended teaching/learning environment with a set of basic features easy to use by students and faculty of all disciplines; 2) developing the basic concepts of new instructional methods to exploit the interactivity of the system in support of higher domains of learning; and 3) preparing to bring together a consortium of government, industry and academic individuals who are dedicated to innovative approaches to education for the 21st century. This will lay the foundation in providing Virginia with a cost-effective method of delivering high quality education remotely in support of some of the 50,000 additional students expected to enroll in Virginia&apos;s public colleges and universities by the year 2001. The proposed hardware/software architectures use existing technologies but anticipate the wider availability of a high-speed Information superhighway and multimedia workstations in the near future. The architecture provides an open environment in which many types of teaching materials and inst ructional software can be incorporated. The prototype provides two-way video to remote sites; shared operation of X-window tools and applications; interactive note-taking; a VCR-like replay of past classes and ancillary material and a full motion video window which can display the instructor, a classroom demonstration, or any PC, Macintosh or X-window application. This instructional capability goes beyond traditional TV courses and traditional classrooms by enabling instructors and students to access multimedia generated from a variety of sources and to use group collaboration tools for interaction between two participants, among small groups, or entire classes. The system will provide audio-visual interaction and allow faculty and remote-site students to share the manipulation of software tools, such as spreadsheets or chemistry models. While the elements of IRI are currently technically feasible, a major portion of the project&apos;s efforts are directed to the developing of new student-centered teaching methods and paradigms which take advantage of the environment and to refining the hardware and software through experience of actual instructional needs. Key to the success of our approach is an interface which students and faculty from all disciplines can use with intimal training. This system will provide access to higher education, not only for traditional students, who for personal or financial reasons choose not to reside at a four-year institution. IRI will promote effective use of network and computer technology for all participating students and faculty. Exposure to technology-enabled interaction will help prepare students for the challenges of increased global competitiveness. Old Dominion University will consider the total project a success in developing a long-term self-sustaining system if half the TELETECHNET courses use IRI within five years, both faculty and students accept and benefit from this mode of teaching as demonstrated with such metr ics as cost satisfaction and there is an increase in the number of students completing four-year degrees. We will consider the one-year phase successful if we shall have used a version of the IRI system in a real class environment and identified the problems in that version. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9503976 Dietterich The goal of this research is to develop and prototype methods for the automatic calibration and validation of computer models of complex systems. The platform for this research is an ecosystem model called MAPSS (Mapped Atmosphere-Plant-Soil System). The purpose of the MAPSS model is to predict the biosphere impact of global climate change. This project aims to improve the development, maintenance, calibration, and accuracy of MAPPS by combining and extending ideas from three areas of computer science: (a) declarative programming, (b) parallel computing, and (c) machine learning. Together the proposed methods will provide model developers with significant speedup through a more efficient representation and parallel implementation, a system for automatic model calibration, and a system for model validation designed to maximize predictive power. These methods will improve the efficiency of model development as well as help to ensure that the finished product is as accurate as is possible. Further, these methods should generalize beyond the MAPSS project, providing a set of tools for the development of many computer models of complex systems.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this research is to develop a system which automatically generates and animates conversations between multiple cooperative agents with appropriate and synchronized speech, intonation, facial expressions, and hand gestures. The research is based on theory which addresses relations and coordinations between these channels. The significance of this research is to provide a three-dimensional computer animation testbed for cooperative conversation theories. Human-machine interaction and training systems need more interactive and cooperative synthetic agents. Conversations are created by a dialogue planner that produces the text as well as the intonation of the utterances. The speaker/listener relationship, the content of text, the intonation and the undertaken actions all determine facial expressions, lip motions, eye gaze, head motion, and arm gesture generators. This project will focus on domains in which agents must propose and agree on abstract plans, and may have to motivate and carry out physical actions and refer to objects in their physical environment during conversation.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9504075 Oden The almost simultaneous development, over the last decade, of hp adaptive finite elements and multi-processor computing as means of dramatically improving fluid flow simulations makes the possibility of combining them very intriguing. The potential payoffs are very high but there are many challenges before such a combination can be achieved. Promising new developments in data structures, adaptive strategies, problem decomposition and robust parallel equation solvers, albeit in the context of model elliptic problems, make this problem tractable. In this project an attempt will be made to extend most of these developments onto solving complex three dimensional viscous incompressible flows. In particular this project will develop a new hp adaptive finite element code built on top of an extendable hash table based data structure and equipped with sophisticated a posteriori error estimators, adaptive strategies for generating optimal meshes, and customized preconditioned conjugate gradient type parallel equation solvers.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project is investigating the use of HyTime for the purpose of supporting content-based or semantic navigation in a networked information environment. HyTime is a standard (ISO/IEC 10744:1992) for representing the structure of hypertext and multi-media documents. HyTime extends Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) with semantic extensions at the meta level. HyTime semantic links are roughly analogous to relationships that might appear in the schema of a conventional database. The investigation consists of four steps: (1) definition of HyTime links on real-world data, (2) assessment of the utility of HyTime links for content-based navigation, (3) construction of a simple prototype demonstration of HyTime on real-world data, and (4) initial consideration of the feasibility of integrating HyTime information with database data. The goal for this work is to provide semantic or content-based navigation for users of the National Information Infrastructure or similar networked-environment and to consider the potential for semantic links between the world of documents with the wmrld of database objects.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Proposal: DMS 95- 05151 PI(s): Iain Johnstone - 1981, David Donoho - 1984 Institution: Stanford Title: Adaptive Estimation, New Tools, New Settings Abstract: The research develops fundamental tools in theoretical statistics to aid understanding of such adaptive procedures, and shows how to tune them so they are noise-cognizant and stable. Underlying the approach are a) the idea of oracles, which know perfectly well how to adapt representations ideally, b) the idea that the goal of adaptation in the presence of noisy data is to quantify how closely realizable procedures (which do not have privileged information about the object) can mimic an oracle, and c) the design of procedures coming as close as possible to the oracle. The project also develops methods for comparing different adaptation schemes by comparing oracles of different kinds, for example time-frequency oracles and time-scale oracles. This is an outgrowth of our earlier results on wavelets, where this approach was used to show that wavelets have a property of being nearly-ideally spatially adaptive. In addition a computational environment is being developed for implementing and systematically testing such approaches. As a further outgrowth of the proposers&apos; earlier work on wavelets, the project studies a number of improvements and extensions of wavelet shrinkage, for example in the directions of classification, confidence bands, correlated data and selection of orthogonal bases. This research seeks to develop statistical theory and computational tools in the general area of adaptive methods of representing and analyzing signals, images and other objects. On the one hand, this project is prompted by the extremely high interest in adaptation on the part of people working in fields of signal processing, image processing, time-frequency analysis, speech processing analysis. New signal representations appear in these fields almost daily, along with new principles fo r selecting representations. Such representations are useful for data compression, which is not the main interest here; but they are also useful for noise removal and signal interpretation, which are important areas for statisticians to consider. On the other hand, this project is prompted by the goal of developing statistical theory which can give clear understanding of such adaptive schemes. Some of the most highly adaptive schemes being suggested in signal processing pose a real challenge to traditional statistical thinking. For example, some adaptation schemes search (either explicitly or implicitly) through thousands or millions of representations of a signal in order to arrive at their final result. A statistician, when thinking about applying such methods to a noisy signal, is by training forced to ask to what extent the result merely reflects the effects of snooping through noise, detecting pseudo-structure which actually due to noise, and due to the vigorous search. The research seeks to develop fundamental tools in theoretical statistics to aid understanding of such adaptive procedures, and shows how to tune them so they are noise-cognizant and stable. This project may have two spin-offs. First, some of the results may be stimulating and/or useful to the community of ``inventors of adaptive procedures&apos;&apos; in signal, image, speech, and time/frequency, and related communities. Second, the theoretical work may stimulate statisticians to take more interest in making further contributions in such directions.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Algorithmic Scalability in Reconfigurable Bus-Based Models</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">For a model to be a workable component of a parallel processing system, it must be scalable. Researchers often design algorithms so that the assumed machine size for running the algorithm grows with the problem size. (This is particularly the case with algorithms for reconfigurable busbased models.) A physical machine size is, of course, fixed. For a scalable model, however, the arbitrary sized machine for running the algorithm can be mapped to the smaller physical machine that actually solves the problem without loss of efficiency. A compiler can perform this mapping, so algorithm designers and programmers can design algorithms for arbitrary size machines and need not design different algorithms or write programs for different sized problems. No reconfigurable bus-based model is known to be scalable, however, unless its computational power is significantly reduced. To better understand the extent to which these models are scalable, the investigator is less restrictive than traditional scalability. This research will investigate scalability of two main types of reconfigurable bus-based models, namely, the Reconfigurable Mesh (R-Mesh) and the Reconfigurable Multiple Bus Machine (RMBM). The RMBM comprises four versions: the B-RMBM, S-RMBM,F-RMBM, and E-RMBM. The investigators have previously established relative scalability results for the S-RMBM and for `separable` algorithms of the E-RMBM, the most powerful version. The research will seek to investigate scalability of general E- RMBM algorithms and study different scalability approaches for different ranges in the relationship of simulated to available machine sizes. Scalability questions for the R- Mesh will also be investigated. These will include relative scalability and scalability of certain classes of algorithms, topics not yet examined for the RMesh, and extensive attempts at complete scalability of the RMesh, a topic that has received only to narrow attention in the past. Scalability questions will also be studied for directional versions of the R-Mesh and RMBM, which have proven particularly useful for directed graph algorithms.</data>

      <data key="e_title">A Theoretical and Practical Basis for Applying Formal Methods to Object-Oriented Programming and C++</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This research seeks a theoretical foundation for specifying and verifying object-oriented programs, and a practical foundation for the use of formal methods with the programming language, C++. The project is extending the model theory and proof theory of abstract data types to help characterize when one abstract data type is a behavioral subtype of another. Previous work has given sufficient conditions for behavioral subtyping among abstract data types with immutable objects. These conditions are based on type specifications, as reflected in algebraic models of these specifications. Behavioral subtyping allows modular specification and verification of programs, using static type information without using case analysis for each subtype. Separately, one proves that the subtype relationships satisfy the semantic conditions of behavioral subtyping. An important problem is to find necessary and sufficient conditions for behavioral subtyping for abstract types whose objects have time-varying state (i.e., that are mutable), since these types occur frequently in practice. Needed are ways to prove behavioral subtype relationships from type specifications. This research would extend the work on modular specification and verification to languages with mutation and non-determinism. The practical work is aimed at providing the fast-growing community of C++ programmers with a foundation for the use of formal methods with this language. Essential to systematic development of code, program verification, code reuse, and other formal development activities, is a formal specification language. This project advances Larch/C++, and interface specification language tailored to specify C++ modules. Tools, including a type-checker for Larch/C++, are being developed, as are a suite of teaching materials, and tutorial and larger worked examples.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Proposal: DMS 95-04414 PI(s): Jianqing Fan - 1989, Stephen Marron - 1982 Institution: U of NC Chapel Hill Title: Processing Massive Noisy Data with Hidden Structure Abstract: This research involves a few inter-related statistical problems ranging from processing images and finding informative structure from massive data, to analyzing survival data, evaluating the success of a business advertisement and understanding the home range of animals. In contrast with traditional approaches, the methods do not assume any restrictive form, and are flexible enough to detect fine structures. This project covers a wide array of statistics methodological developments and foundational research. The new developments enhance the availability of statistical tools, and can lead to significant improvements on existing methods for extracting information from noisy data. Specific objectives are develop new statistical methodologies and investigate their foundational properties for flexible statistical modeling in processing high-dimensional data, nonparametric confidence intervals, mode detection and signal processing. Many scientific disciplines depend in some way on extracting structural information from noisy data. Fields ranging from processing noisy images and evaluating business marketing, to analyzing survival data and forecasting economic climates, which are universes apart in their backgrounds, nevertheless have the common problem of drawing conclusions via processing noisy signals. Such problems may be abstracted as a statistical function estimation problem and can be analyzed by various techniques in this project. The objective of this research is to develop and evaluate flexible statistical modeling techniques. These techniques can be applied in the Federal Strategic Areas such as monitoring environmental and global changes via processing massive collected data where informative structures can hardly be detected by traditional approache s, and building statistical modeling for economic and business activities in the civil infrastructure. The investigators will take advantage of modern computing facilities, and use statistical knowledge to avoid unnecessary data mining and hence reduce significantly data processing time. Thus, the knowledge gained in this study will also be useful in high performance computing of a federal strategic area.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">To achieve maximum benefit from tiling, compiler optimization must exercise more control over data movement and storage assignments than is commonly done. Hierarchical tiling takes responsibility for several phases of compilation and code improvements that are traditionally done separately, such as scalar replacement, register allocation, generating message passing calls, and storage mapping. It uses the mechanisms of explicitly naming and copying data to control the movement of data up and down the memory hierarchy and to exploit all levels of parallelism. Its effectiveness as a systematic framework for hand-crafting highly optimized code has been tested on scientific applications for IBM SP1 system. This project will extend the research in compiler optimizations by investigating the following: (1) Develop a parameterized machine model that captures the architectural information needed to guide hierarchical tiling. (2) Study interactions between tiling at various levels of granularity. (3) Incorporate hierarchical tiling into the SUIF toolset. (4) Extend the work to disk storage, explicit I/O and implicit paging virtual memories. (5) Validate the approach using various programs on different parallel machines.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Scalable Static Techniques for Exhaustive and Incremental Analyses of C Systems</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">In software systems, tools such as compilers, testers, and debuggers require static semantic information, both to insure their correctness and to enhance performance. Incremental update algorithms, which only calculate data flow information affected by the program changes, avoiding total recalculation, efficiently provide consistent documentation for a large evolving software system. Previously, incremental techniques for Fortran-like languages and exhaustive analyses for C programs have been developed. When these analyses of C systems produce solutions, they are inexpensive and high quality; however, often the analyses exhaust available resources without yielding a complete solution, especially for larger programs (over 5,000-10,000 lines of code). This research aims at expanding the applicability of exhaustive techniques to handle a wider class of programs and developing incremental techniques for C systems. The work is performed by an academic and industrial team, focusing on the development of new analysis techniques and their testing on research industrial applications. Goals are to: (i) scale the existing prototype to handle programs with 10,000 to 100,000 lines of code, (ii) develop techniques for analyzing modules without analyzing the entire program (i.e., a separate compilation mode of analysis),(iii) develop incremental techniques for interesting interprocedural static analyses for languages with general purpose pointers, and (iv) enhance the theoretical infrastructure for semantic analysis of modern programming languages (i.e., C, C++, and Fortran 90). The research explores techniques for varying the precision of alias information by designing new, flow-insensitive methods, to augment our current flow-sensitive ones. Partitioning the program variables allows for an aliasing solution with varying degrees of precision for different sets of variables. Experiments are conducted varying the value of k for these different sets, using k-limiting to handle dereferencing in recursive structures. A hybrid incremental analysis algorithm is used as a basis for incrementalizing side effect analysis of C programs.</data>

Three new courses will be introduced, and a fourth is being planned. Three existing undergraduate hardware courses will be revised to included new information on the use of design tools, and design automation theory. The first objective is to teach students how to use design tools, while the second is to teach students how to actively participate in the development of new tools. The final products will be a set of course outlines with detailed guidelines and design-oriented exercises; a set of laboratory manuals providing exercises in creating complex designs and making modifications to existing designs; a set of complex designs to be used either as examples or as the basis for exercises in design modifications; a set of highly sophisticated and completely integrated design tools that will carry the student from the initial inception of an idea through to its implementation; and a set of new textbooks aimed at the problems of design and the use of design automation. Results will be made available through scholarly publications, Internet newsgroups and anonymous FTP, and through a series of summer workshops. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The project develops the theory and implementation of a practical spatial geometric constraint solver that integrates symbolic methods from constructive geometry with numerical methods from homotopy continuation theory. Geometric constraint solvers are a key component in modern Mechanical Computer-Aided Design systems, and offer a critical technology for increased productivity, rapid response manufacturing, and agile manufacturing. Effective solvers exist for planar constraints, but spatial problems of moderate size exceed the capabilities of many research solvers. The solver being developed will cover the broad class of problems specified by distance, angle, and incidence constraints among points, lines, and planes. It will solve small problems interactively and problems of moderate size in a few seconds. Using a constraint graph whose nodes represent elements and whose edges represent constraints, a constraint analysis will decompose the constraint problem into a series of small construction problems that can be solved efficiently using preprocessing. Elementary constructions will be carried out algebraically, more complex construction steps by homotopy continuation. The hybrid algorithm combines the robustness and completeness of symbolic methods with the uniformity and efficiency of numerical methods.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The aim of this research is to develop vision algorithms for analysis of non-rigid motion from medical imagery. We will continue our algorithm development in snake tracking and image velocity field computation for assessment of tissue deformations and analysis of fluid flow from MRI and X-ray imagery, and extend the techniques to 3D. MRI is unique in its ability to non-invasively and selectively alter tissue magnetization, and create tagged patterns within deforming tissue such as the heart muscle. The resulting pattern defines a time-varying curvilinear coordinate system on the underlying tissue, allowing for precise and quantitative measurement of tissue motion and deformation from a sequence of images. The motion of these visible tag lines is tracked with Dynamic Programming (DP) B-spline snakes, and interacting B-spline deformable grids. Warp algorithms have been developed which continuously map two tissue regions in the plane such that two embedded grids of curves are brought into registration. For fluid flow field analysis, a scalar function formulation for optical flow has been developed. The novel aspect of the new optical flow framework is that it automatically enforces incompressibility on the resulting velocity field. Applications of the techniques to various experimental conditions are planned.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The project will focus on the specification, programming, and implementation of different kinds of distributed shared memories. Proof techniques and programming methodologies will be developed for dealing with the complexities in these definitions. Conditions will be developed under which programming with these weak memories has the same net effect as programming in the more familiar sequential domain. The developed methodologies will support both a posteriori as well as a priori approaches towards program design and verification. A testbed for distributed shared memories will be implemented. This testbed will function in a heterogeneous environment of a parallel machine and a high- performance local area network, and will be used for experimenting with protocols and applications from the scientific, database, and digital libraries domain. The testbed will also support distributed simulation of shared memories and architectures.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">NCR-95223 15 PI: Richard Pethia In response to computer security threats, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) has established a Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) to support users of the Internet. The Internet CERT coordination center is located at Carnegie Mellon University&apos;s Software Engineering Institute and has been active since November 18, 1988. CERT is chartered to work with the Internet community in detecting and resolving computer security incidents. Since its inception, CERT has responded to continuous stream of security incidents. The incident rate and impact on Internet sites has grown steadily as the Internet user population has grown. As the incident rate has grown, so has the sophistication of the intruders. Where intruders once focused on exploitation of weak passwords and widely known vulnerabilities, they have now progressed to examining source files for new security flaws, exploiting protocol flaws, and using tool kits to automate their attacks and increase their impact. CERT is expanding its program to increase its emphasis on incident prevention through a combination of technology improvement, security awareness and training, and security assessment activities. This expanded program includes two areas where CERT can provide special help that will facilitate the orderly, secure progression to the next stage in the Internet evolution: 1. Collaboration with router manufacturers 2. Collaboration with network service Providers</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9522319 Jain A laboratory-oriented hands-on curriculum for data communications and computer networking will be developed. This will enable students to experiment with various communications/telecommunications and networking concepts using a workstation, a PC, or a network of workstations. They will be able to design new protocols, verify them using protocol engineering tools, implement them, and visually see the impact of their actions. Data message flows, packet losses, control/routing message flows, virtual circuit setups, link failures, bit errors, etc. will be seen by the students at a slow (visible) speed. Multimedia and sound effects will be used to show abnormal conditions such as errors and losses. Various nodes of the simulated network will be programmable to run automatically or be under manual control of students. The manual control will allow the students to see the effect of unpredictable actions. The major features of this project include the following: 1) Hands-on laboratory-oriented curriculum requiring students to develop protocol modules and experiment with their designs. 2) Integration of traditional concepts. 3) Use of a distributed gaming/simulation environment to allow experimenting with unpredictable behaviors. 4) Use of multimedia visual techniques to show the effects of various actions 5) Application of protocol engineering principles to protocol development. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This objective of this research is to develop a computational framework for behavior modeling adapted to the problem of creating complex scenarios in large-scale virtual environments. The project will develop a modeling system based on hierarchical, concurrent state machines that supports the control of reactive behaviors and provides mechanisms for coordinating behaviors to create critical situations and events. A second research thrust is to create authoring tools to facilitate the design of virtual environments and the definition of scenarios in which computer generated agents play central roles. This technology has application in interactive, real-time simulation environments such as vehicle simulation for driver training, virtual prototyping, and experimental studies of driving safety that require dynamic situations and circumstances to be reproduced across trials without overly restricting subject&apos;s actions and while maintaining diversity, responsiveness, and spontaneity in agent behaviors.</data>

Funding is provided through the Divisions of Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences and Advanced Scientific Computing, as well as by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate. The research combines algorithm and code development with materials theory to address important materials problems for which computational breakthroughs can produce large payoffs. As such, the research spans the strategic initiatives in High Performance Computing and Communications and Advanced Materials and Processing Phase transformation and electronic structure properties of realistically modeled crystalline and amorphous materials will be studied using a new tight binding molecular dynamics code. This new technique represents a compromise between computationally infeasible ab initio techniques and faster - but less accurate - methods that employ classical potentials. The tight binding molecular dynamics method has non-orthogonal basis functions and handles electrostatic interactions. This will allow the study of inhomogeneous systems such as amorphous materials and interfaces, as well as ceramic materials which have significant ionic character in their bonding. The method will build on previous linear scaling techniques which are explicitly parallelizable. The codes will be implemented on the Cornell SP-2. This new technique will allow the study of a variety of physical systems and processes, inaccessible by previous methods, such as solid/liquid and solid/solid phase transformations, defect diffusion in materials and amorphous materials. Besides Cornell, the team includes participants from Corning, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Oxford University, AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, IBM and DEC. %%% This award is one made through the FY95 Computational Approaches to Real Materials competition.

      <data key="e_title">Mathematical Sciences: Computational and Mathematical Investigations in Optimization</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Todd The investigator and his colleagues undertake broad studies of optimization algorithms and the mathematical theory underlying them. The project covers continuous and discrete optimization algorithms, both exact and approximate, their computational complexity, practical large-scale implementation, performance guarantees (in the case of approximate algorithms), and applications in the physical sciences such as elementary particle tracking, as well as more conventional applications in manufacturing and logistics. Particular projects include: - a continuation of large-scale computational testing of implementations of minimum-cost network flow algorithms; - development and testing of algorithms for large-scale nonlinear minimization problems with bound constraints; - performance guarantees for efficient approximation algorithms for machine-scheduling problems with budget constraints and for other combinatorial optimization problems; - development of more efficient interior-point methods for convex programming and for linear programming problems where no initial interior feasible solution is known; - studies of the polyhedral structure of combinatorial problems in graph theory and partially ordered sets, as well as in applications such as crew scheduling -- computational implementation and testing have been an integral aspect of these studies; and - further development of complexity theory for continuous nonconvex problems. These projects range from modeling through algorithm development and analysis to implementation and testing. Optimization addresses questions like: - How do you schedule the production of hundreds of items with varying demands over several months to minimize setup and holding costs, subject to resource limitations and capacities? - How do you determine the geometric conformation of a protein (how it ``folds&quot;) given an approximate en ergy functional for any position? Indeed, complex systems arising in the engineering, physical, and biological sciences, and in the manufacturing and service industries, involving hundreds to millions of interacting variables, frequently lead to optimization problems when one wishes to control or predict their behavior. The investigators study a number of specific projects related to modeling and algorithm development for a variety of applications, ranging from traditional settings like resource allocation, planning, logistics, and distribution problems to new application areas such as airline crew-scheduling, elementary particle tracking, and shop scheduling. A common thread is the search for efficient methods to solve exactly large-scale instances of such problems, or, if that is not likely to be possible, for efficient algorithms that are guaranteed to obtain a solution that is close to optimal in a precise sense. The investigators also test these algorithms computationally on representative instances of such problems using serial and parallel computers.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This research addresses principles for organizing predictable and flexible behavior in complex sensorimotor systems operating in unstructured environments. The central hypothesis of the work is that large classes of correct behavior can be constructed at run-time through the use of a small set of properly designed control primitives (the control basis) and that the skillful use of these sensorimotor primitives generalizes well to other tasks. A control basis is designed to represent a broad class of tasks, to structure the exploration of control policies to avoid irrelevant or unsafe alternatives, and to facilitate adaptive optimal compensation. The Discrete Event Dynamic Systems (DEDS) framework is used to characterize the control basis and to prune inappropriate control composition policies. Dynamic programming (DP) techniques are used to explore safe composition policies in which sensory and motor resources are bound to elements of the control basis to maximize the expected future payoff. An adaptive compensation policy is designed to extend the control basis and to incrementally approximate optimal control policies. A program of theoretical development and empirical analysis is undertaken to demonstrate the utility of this approach in robotics and machine learning applications.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">IRI-9505561 Marschak, Thomas University of California-Berkeley $450,000 - 36 mos The Information Superhighway and the Decentralization of Organizations The &quot;Information Superhighway&quot; promises to lead to the massive dispersion of information-handling activities. What does a large organization lose and what does it gain when it replaces face-to- face exchange of information among a large group of persons with decentralizion to many remote sites? How does a decentralized organization, which has a common task, make the best use of the information infrastructure that ties it together? How should the costs of the infrastructure, and of the local networks that connect to it, be measured and how should the costs be divided up among the users. This research project aims to clarify and study these complex questions. One segment of the program is the modeling of real organizations; another is the development of new theory; and a third is the empirical study of a continually accumulating database on Internet usage at Berkeley, which will convert into a &quot;testbed&quot; for the experimental study of alternative schemes for allocating network resources among users. One aim of the empirical work is the (paper) design of an &quot;On- line University&quot;. In all parts of the research project, problems will be studied from the viewpoints of several disciplines: economics, computer science, electrical engineering, and operations research.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Mathematical Sciences: Sparse Matrix Problems: Data Structures, Algorithms, and Applications</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Davis This project addresses a range of sparse matrix problems, from data structures, to algorithms, to applications. The unifying theme is the unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal method: its implementation, data structures, and applicability to difficult sparse matrix problems in semiconductor device and process simulation. The unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal method encompasses both the multifrontal technique and an approximate degree update algorithm that is much faster (asymptotically and in practice) than computing the true degrees. Although this method uses upper bounds, the ordering quality for both the unsymmetric (Markowitz cost) and symmetric (minimum degree) algorithms does not suffer. The investigator and his colleagues develop parallel factorization and ordering algorithms based on these approaches. They also develop parallel memory allocators (a fast-fits algorithm), a dynamic task graph (dynamic, since the pivot ordering determines the task dag), the development of both pessimistic and optimistic synchronization methods for frontal matrix ``collision&apos;&apos; in the combined uni/multifrontal approach, and other distributed data structures (such as a distributed priority queue for finding pivots of low approximate degree) required for these algorithms. The algorithms and data structures they develop are applied to semiconductor device and process simulation. This is a challenging application, placing a burden not only on the numerical factorization, but on the symbolic ``overhead&apos;&apos; as well. The problems in this domain are based on irregular, adaptive grids (both 2D and 3D). Both direct methods and iterative methods are used. The iterative method used is a preconditioned biconjugate gradient algorithm, with an incomplete LU factorization as the preconditioner. The investigators develop and employ an incomplete multifrontal factorization algorithm, and a multifrontal-based approach for computing the sparse inverse for use as a prec onditioner. The parallel methods the investigators develop are widely applicable to many computationally intensive problems, in particular the modeling of complex physical phenomena: structural stress and fluid-flow in and around the space shuttle, thunderstorms and tornados, circuits and semiconductor devices, the mixing and combustion of complex turbulent reacting flows, the flow of oil in a reservoir, the optimal distillation of gas and petroleum products, and so on. Parallel sparse matrix algorithms and the data structures they require can help to solve these problems. Where will a tornado hit? How fast can you make a CPU chip run? How can automobile emissions be reduced and gas efficiency be increased at the same time? How do we get more gas out of the same amount of crude oil, and how do we get more crude oil out of an oil reservoir? Answering these questions accurately requires a great deal of computation - and much of that computation involves large, sparse matrices. High-speed computation is required - it does no good to predict where a tornado will hit after it has already passed by and done its destruction. Thus the need for parallel algorithms and data structures. The methods the investigators develop are made widely available to researchers in these and other areas. To ensure that the methods are in fact useful for ``real world&apos;&apos; problems, they are incorporated into a widely-used semiconductor simulation package, the Florida Object-Oriented Device/Process Simulator (FLOODS/FLOOPS). FLOODS/FLOOPS is in use in dozens of companies and universities, and its methods form the basis of many commercial semiconductor simulation packages.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Davis This project addresses a range of sparse matrix problems, from data structures, to algorithms, to applications. The unifying theme is the unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal method: its implementation, data structures, and applicability to difficult sparse matrix problems in semiconductor device and process simulation.

Cooperative users should have the flexibility to define their own security enforcement mechanisms and implementation, yet they must also conform to the overall security policy of the system. This research will address the fundamental issues involved in achieving this goal. This capability is needed to permit commercial and governmental users to take full advantage of the recent technological advances in high speed computers, high bandwidth communication, high capacity storage devices, and Internetwork systems such as the world-wide web. Both coordination and security across autonomous domains (independent system administrations) are required for large, distributed information systems, particularly ones implementing multimedia infoware designs, and increasingly available CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work) applications.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Mathematical Sciences: Solutions-Adaptive Grid Partitioning and Variable Ordering for PDEs</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Dear Al, Alex has kept me in the loop as you and he have converged on a revised scope of our proposed investigation into partitioning and ordering methods that take advantage of knowledge of coefficient magnitude, instead of coefficient structure only. Thanks for your support of this work, whose outcomes could feed directly into several other projects. To complete what I believe you need before processing this grant further, he and I have abstracted the project into the following two paragraphs for peers and nontechnical readers. I hope it is okay. Best Regards, David ========================================================================== Solution-adaptive Grid Partitioning and Variable Ordering for PDEs Alex Pothen and David E. Keyes The proposers consider grid partitioning and variable ordering problems that come to the fore in the parallel computation of problems modeled by partial differential equations discretized on unstructured grids. Partitioning algorithms that maintain load balance among the processors while incurring low communication costs for distributed memory parallelism have been developed in earlier work. Here solution-adaptive partitioning methods are proposed that strive, in addition, to attain good convergence rates in such data parallel contexts. Communication volume per iteration may rise, but only modestly for moderate-granularity parallelism, while the more important number of message-startups per iteration should not be strongly affected. Solution-adaptive ordering methods are also proposed for the fast solution of the problems on the local partitions. Two recently developed classes of partitioning and ordering algorithms that have proved to be successful in non-adaptive contexts will feature prominently in both the partitioning and ordering phases of this proposal. One class consists of spectral algorithms, (i.e., algorithms that make use of an approximation to a certain eigenvector of a Laplacian matrix derived from the grid and the discretization sche me), while the second class includes multilevel algorithms. Both algorithms will be generalized to the solution-adaptive context. Many computational problems in science and engineering can be modeled by partial differential equations, and subsequently solved as a system of algebraic equations defined on an unstructured grid. The most natural form of parallelism for such problems requires the original domain to be decomposed into subdomains, which are mapped whole on to individual processors. Iterative domain decomposition algorithms fit naturally into this framework, wherein a solution is assembled from subproblems whose boundary conditions are set by transmitting a limited amount of information between nearest neighbors. The partitioning and ordering methods proposed herein will be useful for solution methods of such domain decomposition type, which are designed with respect for the high communication-to-computation cost ratio in contemporary distributed-memory computers. The key opportunity to be exploited in this work is that of synergistically joining two ideas that have matured separately, and are usually used as ``black boxes&apos;&apos;-- partitioning and ordering based on sparsity structure only, and domain-blocked iteration based on understanding the physical dependencies reflected in the coefficients. The software tools developed in this work will be demonstrated for ``grand challenge&apos;&apos; problems in application areas such as aerodynamics and geophysics.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Numerical Methods for Ill-Posed Problems and Markov Chains</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project concerns two topics in numerical linear algebra: the numerical treatment of Markov chains and regularization of ill-posed linear systems. The topics share common features: singular or nearly singular matrices; use of iterative methods for large-scale problems; problems in matrix perturbation; and connections with infinite dimensional problems. The computation of the steady-state vector of a Markov chain as well as other important quantities are being investigated. In particular, algorithms are being developed and analyzed for calculating mean first passage times and for computing the recurrence matrix of M/G/1 type queues. In addition aggregation methods with overlapping blocks and the behavior of chains with sluggish transients are being considered. When ill-posed problems are discretized they result in ill-conditioned linear systems which must be regularized to yield accurate solutions. There are three main goals in this work. The first is to prove the folk theorem that if the components of the data vector with respect to the singular vectors decay sufficiently fast then the conjugate gradient iteration will produce a regularizing set of solutions. The second is to treat problems with errors in the matrix by a regularized total-least-squares approach. The third is to further preconditioning strategies for iterative solution methods.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">A solution to an over determined linear system, where there may be errors in both the data matrix and the target vector, is required in many important applications in sciences and engineering. Recently, a new technique called Structured Total Least Norm (STLN) has been developed for obtaining the solution that preserves any affine structure, after the data are perturbed to account for the errors. It also permits the error to be minimized in various norms. The STLN algorithm is being investigated and developed into an efficient and practical solution method for many applications. Its computational performance is being studied and a more complete convergence theory is under development. Significant algorithmic and improvements are being made in order to efficiently handle large-scale problems and special structures. A particular study is being conducted to apply the STLN method to the model reduction by Hankel norm approximation problem. The effect of different norms are being explored. The STLN algorithm is being extended to solve more general problems where the structured matrix is a differentiable function of parameters to be estimated, and its performance is to be compared to other parameter estimation methods such as Prony&apos;s method.</data>

There have been several mutually beneficial exchanges (visits, courses, research) between these two groups over the last four years. The purpose of this project to expand this cooperation, not only in basic research, but also on applications such as manufacturing and robot-assisted surgery. The technical goal of this project is to integrate object-tracking techniques from computer vision and motion-planning techniques from robotics, in order to build a new tool, called the Intelligent Observer (IO for short), that will facilitate collaborative experimental research among geographically dispersed groups. While this project builds upon the two groups&apos; strength in vision, planning, control, and robotics, the resulting Intelligent Observer will be a tool to enhance their future research capabilities in these domains. This tool will be used interactively by people at one or several geographical locations to observe and participate in an experiment implemented at another site. The hardware of the IO will consist of one or more vision sensors mounted on mobile platforms available at the experimental site. The software of the IO will accept high-level commands input by the users on their workstations, plan and control the motions of the platforms to allow the vision sensors to acquire enough visual information to meet the users&apos; requests, apply image understanding techniques to extract information pertinent to the users&apos; requests, and for each user, provide a pertinent graphic rendering of the experimental scene on a display. In addition to facilitating remote collaborations in research, the IO technologies should also benefit operations such as telepresence, teleconferencing, surveillance, and interactive TV.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9521074 Brett A Directory Services testbed based on the WHOIS++ protocol, is proposeed for locating people and resources on the Internet. WHOIS++ provides a highly flexible client/server environment that allows a user to search across multiple distributed databases located on multiple servers, without prior knowledge of the architecture of the database or the network location of the desired information. This project proposes to deploy a medium-scale (&gt;450,000 entries) WHOIS++ database distributed across at least 13 servers (which contain the actual directory data base entries), and utilizing at least six centroids (data bases of indexes which point to the individual servers) in a three-level mesh (centroids which point to lower-level centroids which, in turn, point to the lowest level of centroids which point to the actual data base servers). In addition, this project proposes to develop a widely-usable access method based on clients for the World Wide Web (e.g., Netscape or Mosaic), create interface modules to allow the use of a number of different database technologies to store the WHOIS++ data, determine and implement the security and privacy issues likely to be required for use in the commercial sector, and determine whether the protocol will scale to serve the Internet at large.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Applications of Group Theory to Large Scale Computation</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project addresses computational issues for finite groups that are currently beyond the scope of current algorithms and existing technology. The groups are represented either as permutation groups or as matrix groups defined over finite fields. The questions of interest concern both group theoretic structure and applications of the group theory. A central motivation for the research is the construction of representations for matrix groups defined over finite fields. This is an important part of a large-scale international effort to develop a suite of computational tools for performing matrix group computations. The tools to be developed have application to problems in the physical sciences, engineering, and those parts of mathematics dealing with high dimensional matrix representations of groups. A second research area computational techniques for solving the minimum word problem for finite groups. This problem arises in many contexts, such as routing in interconnection networks and coding theory, and is known to be computationally difficult. The research will lead to new algorithms which use group automorphisms to prune the search tree of possible solutions. A third research area is the development of a software architecture to bring parallel computers to bear on large scale problems in computational group theory, such as the construction of very large matrix and permutation representations. Such as integrated, interactive environment will enable researchers to quickly overcome the initial learning barrier for effective use of parallelism. They will be able to combine readily available networks of workstations at their home site (such as student labs), with an already familiar language, such as GAP or LISP.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9509195 Zelditch This research will extend studies of the ontogeny (the development of single individuals from egg to adult) of body form to be informative about phylogeny, and to provide information that was not available from comparisons of other body features. The proposed research will extend these studies of the ontogeny of body form, as part of an ongoing revision of piranha fishes. %%% The significance of the work is that it involves use of a novel morphometric method and investigation of the strengths and weaknesses of this method and its utility to systematic biology. Specifically, the research will address general questions regarding the relationship between ontogeny and phylogeny. One general question concerns the potential constraints that ontogeny may impose on morphological evolution. A commonly invoked constraint is Odevelopmental integrationO the association among the parts of an ontogeny. One specific hypothesis is that developmentally integrated features will exhibit congruent phylogenetic patterns because, in effect, they are not independent characters. This has been an important issue in systematics and evolutionary morphology and will be examined in this research. ***</data>

      <data key="e_title">SGER: Dynamic Fault Tolerance Methods for Robotics</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This research, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode, investigates the area of fault tolerance for robotics. This activity has produced a series of potentially valuable individual ethods. The goal of this project is to develop the foundations for a rigorous approach to robotic fault tolerance. The research involves synthesis of a protective operating system shell environment for robots, and incorporation of this environment into a new approach for provably fault tolerant robotic systems. The operating system shell is designed to protect the robot from the effects of errors in the lower level manipulator system and the higher level plan. This shell is composed of a number of fault tolerance tasks at a discrete decision making level. These tasks will be identified and outlined for a three link planar robot during the year of exploratory work. The robot will be enhanced with two sensors per joint and will be kinematically redundant for positioning tasks in the plane. This level of hardware redundancy will provide fault tolerance capabilities to the robot. A formal model will be developed for this simple example robot and used to demonstrate the potential benefits of the research approach. This work will provide formal methods to verify fault tolerance for lower and higher level subsystems of a robot system. The key overall goal is to combine diverse techniques for robotic fault tolerance into a provably correct methodology. The development of formal tools for the approach will be important in proving rigorous results about robot fault tolerance. In the one year of the SGER project, a series of fundamental examples will demonstrate how the above approach can significantly impact this emerging research area.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Schema Induction in a Structure-Sensitive Connectionist Model</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9511504 HUMMEL This research will develop a computer system to model how people learn schemas from examples. Schemas are knowledge structures that describe general situations, events, rules, or relationships. For example, a Restaurant Schema might specify the kinds of events that take place in restaurants, and the relationships between the actors in those events (e.g., chefs, waiters, and customers, etc.); a Family Relation Schema might specify the kinds of relationships that define various family members, such as sisters, brothers, parents, uncles, etc. A schema is very general, in that it refers to many specific situations, and also highly structured, in that it specifies the relationships between objects, events, or even between other relationships. Psychologists and computer scientists have long recognized the utility of schemas as a basis for reasoning: If one can recognize an object or situation as an instance of a general schema, then one can use the schema to reason about the specific object or situation. For example, the Family Relation Schema tells us to expect that Mom&apos;s brother, Bob, is our uncle, and that if Bob has children, then they will be our cousins. Due to the schema, it is not necessary to learn the family relations for every individual separately. Although the generality and structured nature of schemas make them extremely useful forms of knowledge, they also make them very difficult to model: Traditional symbolic approaches to computer modeling are good at representing structured information, but they have difficulty flexibly matching specific instances to general facts; by contrast, connectionist models are good at flexibly matching instances to general categories, but they have great difficulty representing structured information (such as rules and relationships). Perhaps for this reason, no one has ever developed a formal and general model of schema-based learning and reasoning. Hummel and Holyoak have developed a computer mo del of analogy that combines a connectionist architecture with the capacity to represent and learn relational structures. The model&apos;s capacity to represent structured information in a flexible, general manner makes it an ideal vehicle for simulating human schema learning and use. The research will apply the model&apos;s approach to the representation of structure to the problems of representing, learning, and using schemas. The result will be a model that can (a) learn general schemas from specific examples, (b) match new instances to learned schemas, and (c) use the schemas to make inductive inferences about the new examples. The model will be the first formal theory of human schema-based reasoning, and will contribute substantially to our understanding or human reasoning is a wide variety of domains. It will also be the first working computer system to use schemas to reason flexibly about general knowledge domains. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9503544 Binder Maryville College is seeking support in connecting its campus to INTERNet by installing a node on campus. The support would be in the form of computer hardware, communications software, and communication services. Maryville College currently has dial-in access to INTERNet through the University of Tennessee in Knoxville for most of its faculty and staff, but this service is quite limited, and it is not available to students.

      <data key="e_abstract">Sethian The investigator and his colleague study the motion of singularities in solutions of differential equations, in particular, the motion of interfaces as described by level-set methods and applied to problems in interface motion, and the motion of vortices in three space dimensions, as described by vortex methods and other Lagrangian techniques. The interface techniques exploit Hamilton-Jacobi methodology coupled to upwind schemes for hyperbolic solvers; new work focuses on developing fast methods, methods for multiple interfaces, and the incorporation of effects of visibility, surface diffusion, and reflection/re-emission in surface profile motion. The vortex motion through Lagrangian methods develops machinery from renormalization methods and polymer analysis from statistical physics applied to fluid phenomena through linkage with Shenoy-Williams methodology, and Kosterlitz-Thouless formulations. The investigators develop methods to follow the motion of interfaces and vortices. Such problems arise in flows of materials, for instance, and whenever the places where objects or materials meet or end change with time. These are common situations throughout science and engineering. The work is applied to a number of areas. In etching, deposition, and lithography in the manufacture of microelectronic components, the work is used to analyze process steps leading to higher yield and efficiency of electronic devices. In image enhancement, segmentation, and recognition applied to medical imaging, the work leads towards automatic software for recognizing cardiac data in CT and MRI scans. In grid generation, the techniques are used to develop new techniques for building grids around complex bodies, as required in aircraft and engine design. The Lagrangian and vortex particle work focuses on generation of large turbulent structures in wakes, motions of polymers in superfluids, and fundamentals of superconductivity.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Prototyping Multiscalar Processors</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project is evaluating a new architectural paradigm that can extract and exploit the parallelism in sequential code. This new approach uses both software scheduling in the compiler, as in VLIW, and hardware scheduling at run-time, as in superscalar architectures. The compiler segments code into large blocks of instructions that form subgraphs of the control-flow graph, though not necessarily basic blocks. The compiler appends synchronization information to each block that describes which registers must be shared with blocks. The compiler appends synchronization information to each block that describes which registers must be shared with other blocks. The blocks or tasks are passed to separate identical parallel execution units, each of which executes its task sequentially. Tasks are scheduled optimistically, so that some tasks may be executed by a unit when they would not be executed in a sequential system; in such cases, the tasks are &quot;squashed,&quot; which means that their results are not written to memory or registers. At the end of each task, it blocks until the system determines that the task will not be squashed; at that time results are committed. The collection of execution units appears logically to be one unit, with a single register file. Shared register values are passed on an inter-execution-unit network, and tasks that need shared values block until the values are produced. During the first two years of this award is devoted to compiler design for the new architecture, to comparison with other architectures using simulation, and to conceptual refinement of the architecture. During later years, work is expected to focus on implementation.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The rapidly expanding technology of cellular communications, wireless LAN, and satellite services will make it possible for users to access information anywhere and at anytime. In this environment, users will be mobile, use low powered computers, and communicate with the network over narrow bandwidth links. Such an environment introduces new challenges in the design of communication mechanisms due to constraints such as bandwidth, energy, cost, and the availability of computing resources due to host mobility. Hence, communication protocols should be designed for adaptability to changing environments brought by mobility. The research project will design and build support for mobile communications applications that explicitly take into account bandwidth limitations, energy limitations, and mobility using the following approaches: (1) The communication between the client and the server will be via an intermediary. Indirect interaction allows for optimization and development of specialized protocols for the wireless link and mobile host without having to change any protocol that is running on the fixed hosts. (2) Design environment aware communication primitives that will have access to the current environment state and also be notified about any changes. Thus, the type of communication to use can be tailored to the prevailing conditions.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The Virtual World Data Server is a multi-user, distributed, real-time data server intended for very large virtual environment simulations. The heart of this system is the Real-Time Storage Server (RTSS). The RTSS is designed to efficiently store and retrieve large amounts ( &gt; 1 terabyte) of spatially distributed heterogeneous data. The RTSS communicates over high speed asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) connections with multiple interactive real-time simulations. It establishes a two-way link with each active simulation in order to determine where the current viewing position is and where the viewer is headed. The RTSS makes a determination of what 3-dimensional information is needed, retrieves that information from disk in an optimized fashion and delivers it to the simulation in a just-in-time manner. The RTSS is complemented by an advanced three-dimensional visual simulation system. Together these two systems are capable of supporting a variety of demanding applications including (but not limited to) urban planning, medical, emergency response, physics, architecture and urban design. This system promises to dramatically improve the way that cities are planned and scientific and medical experiments are visualized. It allows community members and interested citizens to understand and evaluate the impact of policy and planning decisions and it provides capabilities for scientists to visualize datasets over 100 times larger than that which is possible today.</data>

The heart of this system is the Real-Time Storage Server (RTSS). The RTSS is designed to efficiently store and retrieve large amounts ( &gt; 1 terabyte) of spatially distributed heterogeneous data. The RTSS communicates over high speed asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) connections with multiple interactive real-time simulations. It establishes a two-way link with each active simulation in order to determine where the current viewing position is and where the viewer is headed. The RTSS makes a determination of what 3-dimensional information is needed, retrieves that information from disk in an optimized fashion and delivers it to the simulation in a just-in-time manner. The RTSS is complemented by an advanced three-dimensional visual simulation system. Together these two systems are capable of supporting a variety of demanding applications including (but not limited to) urban planning, medical, emergency response, physics, architecture and urban design. This system promises to dramatically improve the way that cities are planned and scientific and medical experiments are visualized. It allows community members and interested citizens to understand and evaluate the impact of policy and planning decisions and it provides capabilities for scientists to visualize datasets over 100 times larger than that which is possible today.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9424639 Murray The objective of this research is to develop, study, and implement algorithms for solving large-scale, nonlinear optimization problems. A large-scale optimization problem is characterized by a large number of variables and constraints. Two solution approaches form the focus of the research. These approaches are respectively, the interior point (barrier) method and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method. The interest in the interior point method stems from their success on linear programming problems, and some interesting properties that may be of value when certain difficult constraints are encountered. The interior point method can be used to eliminate constraints on the eigenvalues of a matrix. On the other hand, interest on the use of SQP is prompted by the success of the approach on small and medium-sized problems, and the experiences of the investigators on the performance of the technique on two classes of large, practical problems that differ substantially in character. If successful with these approaches, the developed algorithms will be coded into a software to facilitate their applications by practitioners. These are several engineering, manufacturing, scientific, and business problems that can be described by large-scale nonlinear optimization models. To date, finding a general solution algorithm to large scale optimization community. If successful, the algorithms being investigated in this research could open the window to a better understanding of this class of optimization problems. Many problems in various areas of human endeavor stand to benefit from the results of this work.</data>

The intended approach of this project is to use the position of these two organizations to bring together members of the academic research and development community with members of the software publisher community to identify issues, discuss their resolution and develop collaborations that will bring NSF-funded ideas and projects to market and increase their impact on education. The vehicle for this meeting is the national meeting of the Software Publishers Association, scheduled for Boston, MA Sept 26-30, 1995. Typically, 1,500 people attend the east cost conference of SPA. We plan a series of activities during this conference that will address the objectives above. Some of these activities will be open to the general audience attending SPA. Other activities will be limited to an invited group of academics and publishers that will begin what is hoped will be an on-going dialog that contributes to the resolution of the identified issues. ***</data>

      <data key="e_title">Statistical and Computational Problems in Genetics and Molecular Biology</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This proposal addresses a variety of statistical and computational problems that arise in genetics and molecular biology. An important aim of the research project is the training and development of post-doctoral research fellows in this interdisciplinary area. The problems described here are part of our ongoing collaborations with geneticists and molecular biologists from USC and elsewhere. All of them have significant computational and statistical components. We are studying statistical and algorithmic aspects of physical mapping. Among these are optical mapping, by which ordered restriction maps are produced using fluorescence microscopy. The long term aim is the development of an online program that produces such an ordered map. We are analyzing the efficiency of various physical mapping strategies based on variants of sequence-tagged-sites schemes. In particular, we are studying inhomogeneous clone and anchor distributions, the effects of false, ambiguous or missing anchors, and strategies that allow for mixtures of clone walking and random steps. We are developing statistical models for the evolution of genome rearrangements and methods for reconstructing phylogenetic trees from such data. This is motivated in part by data on rearrangements occurring in the promoter of GFAP in the brain. A related project addresses other aspects of phylogenetic tree reconstruction, in particular the effects of dependence among sites when DNA sequence data is used to build the tree. Motivated by data on rRNA promoters, we are also developing algorithms for fitting more detailed evolutionary models when the underlying tree is known. We are investigating the statistics of pattern counts in molecular sequences. These a re frequently used to characterize biological features such as coding regions, regulatory sequences, splice sites and so on. Our focus is on the development of useful computational algorithms for pattern counts when the underlying sequence structure must be estimated from the data. A further project addresses the estimation of deletion rates in mitochondrial genomes in humans. A PCR assay is used to detect whether or not a cell line contains any mitochondria with the deletion. The data comprise the results of the assay on several cell lines. We are developing analogs of the Luria-Delbruck method of fluctuation analysis for estimating the rate of deletions. The results are used to study the role of the deletion in Kearns-Sayre Syndrome patients. We are developing Monte Carlo likelihood methods for inference in genetics, aimed primarily at the study of mitochondrial and nuclear gene variation in humans, and its use in the study of human evolution. One focus is on the estimation of recombination rates, in particular between human disease loci and a variety of marker loci.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Design and Evaluation of Algorithms for Storage Reclamation in Object Databases</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">A problem for an object database management system (ODBMS) is the reclamation of storage for persistent, secondary-memory objects that are no longer accessible. Although excellent reclamation algorithms have been developed for transient, primary-memory objects, these algorithms have been shown to be inappropriate for use on secondary-memory objects in object databases. This project investigates new algorithms for ODBMS storage reclamation. The critical aspects of secondary-memory reclamation are teased apart into a set of distinct policy areas. Rigorous trace-driven simulations of the algorithms are performed to gain an understanding of the relative performance of alternative policies within each area as well as an understanding of the interplay of policies across areas. Prototype implementations of the most promising algorithms are integrated into an existing ODBMS. This project makes three primary contributions to the ODBMS research, development, and user communities. First, a set of new reclamation algorithms appropriate for object databases is defined. Second, performance evaluations of the algorithms are used to reveal the circumstances under which the algorithms should be considered for adoption within a particular ODBMS or application. Third, a catalog of benchmark and live-application traces is created to establish an empirically founded characterization of application behavior that can be used far beyond evaluation of reclamation algorithms.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Constraint Query Languages</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project explores the development and use of constraint programming languages in database applications. Constraint Query Languages (or CQLs) are applicable to many domain-specific areas, such as spatial databases, because their basic data type generalizes the relational tuple data type and is closer to the application semantics, e.g., for spatial databases these generalized tuples are convex spatial point sets . Most importantly, CQLs are designed so that I/O-efficient access to large sets of generalized tuples can be supported through existing multi-dimensional searching data structures. This project is an investigation of both the principles and the practice of CQLs. The principles include: the expressive power of various classesof constraints both linear and nonlinear; the design of calculus/algebra languages combining constraints and objects; the optimization of constraint programs; and the data structures for indexing very large sets of constraints. The practice involves developing prototypes of persistent constraint languages and evaluating them in three concrete application areas: solid modeling in design databases; map overlays in spatial databases; and subsequence matching in scientific databases. Constraint Query Languages will be key components of the next generation of declarative database interfaces, because they capture domain-specific semantics in an efficient fashion, and their successful implementation will be a significant extension of the current relational and object- oriented database technologies</data>

The main objective is to provide a general approach to manage and analyze the potential economy consisting of users of the network services and the service providers, leading to an implementable pricing tool for communications networks. The first phase will enhance the existing simulation models by developing additional mechanisms for providing better predictions of waiting times. These additional mechanisms include: (1) approximating queuing mechanisms for computing prices, (2) developing guidelines to set parameters automatically, (3) adding functionality to simulation subroutines, (4) automating some sampling subroutines, (5) performing testing, (6) developing computing tools for the pricing scheme. The second phase will implement pricing mechanism on LANs and building a simple user interface with the ability to query, optimize costs, and present results in an appropriate format. At the server level, software agents will be developed to respond to user queries and perform estimation and pricing calculations. The third and final phase of the project intends to develop the complete final priority pricing mechanism for the Wide Area Network environments.</data>

      <data key="e_title">MDARTS: A Multiprocessor Database Architecture for Real- Time Systems</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Advanced real-time systems, such as the Next Generation Workstation/Machine Controller (NGC) for automated factories, require built-in database support for concurrent data access. However, conventional database systems do not provide the performance levels or response time guarantees needed by these real-time applications. To address these needs, an object-oriented software system called Multiprocessor Database Architecture for Real-Time Systems (MDARTS) is being designed, implemented, and evaluated. MDARTS supports explicit specification of real-time requirements and semantic constraints at an object-granularity level. Unlike other approaches, MDARTS has built-in strategies to examine these specifications at runtime during application initialization and to dynamically adjust its data management configuration on a per-object basis to provide real-time guarantees. For maximum performance on shared-memory multiprocessors, MDARTS supports concurrent, direct shared-memory data access. This unique design achieves transaction execution times two to three orders of magnitude faster than current real-time d atabase systems. In summary, the contributions of this project are two-fold. One, novel database technologies will be introduced, including methodologies for providing probabilistic and hard real-time guarantees and the implementation of an open multiprocessor database architecture providing extremely high levels of performance. Two, MDARTS technology will be applied to develop distributed, open architecture controllers for actual manufacturing machine tools, evaluating its effectiveness for addressing the high-performance real-time data management needs of manufacturing applications.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The objective of this `applied algorithm` project is to continue the establishment and study of the interrelationships between formal language theory and the structure and behavior of the informational macromolecules. The formal representation of recombinant behaviors exhibited by double stranded DNA in the presence of specified sets of enzymatic activities is of crucial interest. This project includes the continued investigation of splicing systems and the languages they define. The fact that DNA occurs naturally in both linear and circular forms, which interact through recombination, has motivated the initiation of a unified theory of interacting linear and circular words. This project includes further development of this theory with emphasis on splicing. A treatment of languages of bi-infinite words and semi-infinite words is made, which will initiate the integration of these theories with the theories of languages of circular and finite words. This project directs special attention to the sofic shifts, which are a class of languages of bi-infinite words that play a major role in dynamical systems. This project is significant in that it establishes and clarifies relations between formal language theory and molecular biology. It develops an additional source of suggestive problems and imagery for formal language theory. Also, over a time scale of decades, it is expected to suggest questions and contribute precision to biochemical thought about informational macromolecules and their behavior. Additionally, the project provides new problems and approaches to the study of symbolic dynamics. This project combines theoretical computer science, biology and dynamical systems in a mutually stimulating and reinforcing way.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9527459 Knapp This award will allow San Jose State University to develop a two course sequence in the field of Human Computer Interfaces (HCI). These courses will by project-oriented and taught in a lecture/laboratory mode. The projects, along with much of the course content, will by based on the research being performed at the San Jose State University in the HCI areas of biosignal input, sound localization, sonification and visualization. The lectures will cover subjects from pattern recognition to non-linear filtering to graphics algorithms. The laboratory projects will be developed by the course instructors with the close assistance of the Department of Occupational Therapy, and the Computer Art and Design Center (CADRE). Project teams of engineering students will be augmented by &quot;clients&quot; from these department who will define the requirements for the projects and evaluate each team&apos;s progress toward success. These courses will be taught at San Jose State University and at University of California, Santa Cruz via the new CALREN interactively networked teaching facility. Once the course has been fully developed, sites across the Silicon Valley will be able to present these courses.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of the Polya project is to increase productivity in the development and maintenance of programs, by placing more emphasis on the user interface within the programming language itself. This research seeks new ways to write programs, to make programs efficient, and to reuse program parts. It is concerned directly with software engineering and rapid prototyping. The programming language Polya incorporates new mechanisms that allow a group of people to define and use notations of their problem domain, so that programs can more closely resemble the algorithms being used. Secondly, Polya has mechanisms that make it easier to describe how variables of high-level types should be implemented, requiring fewer modifications to the algorithm than is the case with more traditional languages. The transform, a new kind of program part, can be reused with relative ease. A prototype implementation of Polya uses the Synthesizer Generator as the platform. This research focuses on three areas: (1) research aimed at a significant extension of the pattern matching capabilities of the Polya transformational approach and exploration of new ideas on reverse engineering; (2) experimentation with Polya, in order to develop a library of useful program parts; (3) practical and theoretical improvements to Polya, its implementation, and related tools such as a source-level debugger.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this project is to develop theory, tools, and methods needed to carry out formal specifications of large software systems. The approach is to formalize the Jackson/Zave (J/Z) specification techniques using an extension of the Higher-Order Logic (HOL) interactive theorem-proving system. This project focuses on the theoretical and design issues that this entails for HOL, and the methodological implications for the J/Z approach. The research explores ideas from research on polymorphism and module systems for programming languages, applying them to HOL theories. The J/Z method has been used to provide a specification of the AT&amp;T 5ESS switch using a first-order model-based approach. HOL has been used for substantial hardware and software specification and verification projects such as the Viper Chip and the dynamic semantics of the Standard Meta- Language (SML). This research explores the possibility that realizing the J/Z method within HOL can provide a basis for user level validation and, more generally, for formal verification of software. The project is conducted as a joint academic/industrial enterprise drawing on research in logic, type theory, and semantics at the University of Pennsylvania, and research in interactive theorem proving, application software, and specification techniques at AT&amp;T Bell Labs.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9522207 Bernat This award provides infrastructure support for a program designed to substantially increase the number of minorities, particularly Hispanics, who complete degree programs in the areas of computer and information science and engineering. It involves both the Computer Science and Computer Engineering Departments at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). The project is built around the concept of Affinity Groups, groups which are centered about a research area and which involve both graduate and undergraduate students and one or two faculty members at the center of each group. Within the groups, emphasis is on developing social and communication skills as well as on research and technical skills. A strong evaluation component is built into the project. It is anticipated that the structure developed has the potential to become a model for the success of minority students at a wide range of similar urban, commuter institutions. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">ABSTRACT: NCR-9505443, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Blind Simulation and Regenerative Processes, PI-James A. Bucklew and Peter E. Ney: Importance sampling is used to speed up Monte Carlo simulation of rare events. The methods used to date have required exact knowledge of the underlying probability structure of the system being simulated. Direct Monte Carlo simulation requires only an assumption of ergodicity to guarantee that relative frequency estimates of system parameters will converge to true values. The direct Monte Carlo technique is an example of a blind simulation technique: a generic class of methodologies which bootstrap their way without exact knowledge of the underlying probability law. Some partial results achieved to date indicate that in many interesting situations, blind techniques can perform just about as well as those utilizing much more prior information. Applied to systems with memory (Markovian for example) these techniques lead naturally to the study of regenerative processes. These are processes that at random times stop and essentially start themselves over again. Aspects of the theory of these processes are yet to be developed and are needed for the analysis of blind simulation methods. This study of blind simulation and regenerative processes promises to very important in the bag of tricks available to system simulators.&lt;br/&gt;***************************************************************************** Aubrey M.

      <data key="e_title">Access Methods for Bitemporal Databases</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Traditional databases capture only the most current data (snapshot) of the modeled reality. While snapshot information is enough for a number of applications, it is not sufficient for applications that require past and/or future data. Instead, a bitemporal database is needed, i.e., a database that supports both valid time (the time when an event was valid in the modeled reality) and transaction time (the time when the database was updated). While much research has been performed recently on access methods that support transaction time, not much has been done for bitemporal indexes, i.e., methods that support both transaction and valid time on the same index structure. The objective of this project is to design efficient access methods for bitemporal databases. A novel approach is used that reduces bitemporal queries to problems of partial persistence for which efficient access methods are then designed. Various basic bitemporal queries are addressed, like the bitemporal pure and range timeslice queries. Concurrency and recovery issues for the new access methods are examined. In addition, the migrati on of bitemporal data to a three-level storage architecture is examined. The results of this project will enhance the efficient implementation of temporal database management .</data>

End User Searching And Filtering: Designing digital libraries in which it is possible to find the right information in a glut of information. These two problems have been chosen because they are urgent, enough research exists to frame them but not enough to solve them, and the work on these problems is scattered across multiple disciplines that need to be brought to form a research community.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">IRI-9528808 Borgman, Christine University of California $35,992 - 12 mos Social Aspects of Digital Libraries The Digital Libraries research has brought together researchers from computer science, communications, library and information science, psychology, linguistics, and from the disciplines in which digital libraries are being created, including the sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities. Digital Libraries are a prime example of large societal problems that bring human &amp; technological resources to bear on their solutions. Many social aspects of digital libraries need to be addressed, as we come to undertand the full range of issues they encompass. This research workshop will focus on two social problems that are urgent in developing the National and Global Information Infrastructures: Information Needs: Identifying real information needs and developing digital libraries to mee those needs. End User Searching And Filtering: Designing digital libraries in which it is possible to find the right information in a glut of information. These two problems have been chosen because they are urgent, enough research exists to frame them but not enough to solve them, and the work on these problems is scattered across multiple disciplines that need to be brought to form a research community.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">ABSTRACT: 9526358, Rochester Institute of Technology, &quot;GOALI: Modulation Codes for Multiamplitude Recording Channels&quot;, PI-McLaughlin: This research is in the area of high density high data rate optical recording. The optical recording technology receiving the most attention is magneto-optics. While magnetic-optic drives are among the highest performing in both storage capacity and data transfer rate, their performance is limited. In particular no commercially available high data rate (&gt;40 Mbits/sec) digital recording system using a single head magneto-optic (or magnetic or optical) disk exists. An optical recording technology known as electron trapping optical memory (ETOM) developed by Optex will be capable of providing single head data transfer rates in excess of 100 Mbits/sec. The ETOM material allows one to store multiple signal amplitudes on the media as opposed to conventional saturation magnetic or optical recording. This project is a joint Optex and RIT project in the development of modulation codes for the multiple amplitude recording channel. The codes considered include both runlength limited and partial response techniques. The principal investigator will spend time at Optex.&lt;br/&gt;*****************************************************************************&lt;br/&gt;Aubrey M.

      <data key="e_title">Routing and Scheduling of File Transfer in Packet - Switched Networks</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9505963 Mao Data traffic in networks has always been dominated by file transfers. In today&apos;s high-volume applications like the Internet bulletin boards, most files are simple text files. In the future, files are expected to consist of hypertext documents, with significant audio and video components. Already, a few seconds of low-quality audio occupy hundreds of kilobytes. These numbers are indicative of the large sizes of future multimedia files. Other applications of the future which are thought to involve large file sizes are those arising from scientific applications, large-scale databases and network-wide system backups. In this proposal the principal investigators take issue with the notion that large files should be routed as small files conventionally are -- by breaking up the file into packets and relying on packet routing algorithms. They examine and propose to study the problem of scheduling large file transfers. Past approaches traditionally avoid collecting information across networks to schedule particular files, simply because the overhead of doing so overwhelms any benefits accrued in computing optimal schedules. However, when file sizes are very large and are also known in advance of transmission, it makes eminent sense to collect information and compute good schedules, thus utilizing network resources efficiently. The researchers will formulate a file transfer scheduling problem, argue its importance, assess shortcomings in the available research on this problem and outline issues for future research. *** ******* Darleen Fisher Program Manager Networking and Communications Research Program 4201 Wilson Blvd. Room 1175 Arlington Va 22230 (703) 306-1949 (703) 306-0621 (FAX)</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">ABSTRACT: NCR-9505619, University of Southwestern Louisiana, Generalized Hamming Weights of Algebraic-Geometric Codes and Asymptotically Good Algebraic-Geometric Codes, PI-Gui-Liang Feng, and T.R.N. Rao: This research will explore the following problems: (1) to develop a simple and efficient method to determine a lower bound of the generalized Hamming weights of algebraic-geometric (AG) codes, such that the method can also be used to determine the weight hierarchy of a special class of AG codes, for example, Hermitian codes and generalized Hermitian codes, and (2) to investigate the construction of asymptotically good improved AG codes, and improved AG codes that exceed the Gilbert-Varshamov bound for some special finite fields. A more general approach will be developed to determine the minimum distance bound, which is as good or better than the bound given by the Reiman-Roch theorem (referred to here as the Goppa Bound) or by counting the number of well behaving terms (known as the Feng-Rao bound). The Feng-Rao bound was shown to be superior to the Goppa bound. Based on this approach the principal investigators will develop a lower bound of the generalized Hamming weights. For special classes of AG codes, this method can be used to determine the weight hierarchy. Classes of AG codes with true minimum distance greater than the Goppa and the Feng-Rao bounds will be constructed which provide good code properties for length and minimum distance. An attempt will be made to prove that these codes are asymptotica lly good codes. The problem of finding a sequence of AG codes exceeding the Gilbert-Varshamov bound will be the main feature of the research.&lt;br/&gt;***************************************************************************** Aubrey M.

PSEs are more useful when they are more specific. However, rather than build one problem- solving environment for one class of user, application domain, programming language and machine, this project aims at the basic research that will enable us to develop tools for building specific PSEs.

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this project is to help scientists and engineers carry out computational tasks more effectively by doing research on: - The integration of symbolic and numeric computation to facilitate problem specification, exploration and result verification. - Hierarchies of reusable computational abstractions organized in libraries with well-defined navigational structures. - Exploiting commercial standards and tools for object-request brokers, compound documents, and collaboration infrastructure. The project takes a novel approach to problem-solving environments (PSEs). Its focus is on the entire process of problem-solving from initial conception, symbolic specification, solution, visualization, comparison with experimental data, and feed back. The project focuses on problem-solving environments, not merely programming environments. This focus leads to research on reusable abstractions at all levels of problem-solving. Important abstractions include the problem-solving method itself, method-specific abstractions for sequential and parallel program design, reasoning and debugging, performance analysis and tuning, and frameworks for class libraries. PSEs are more useful when they are more specific. However, rather than build one problem- solving environment for one class of user, application domain, programming language and machine, this project aims at the basic research that will enable us to develop tools for building specific PSEs. To use a metaphor, rather than doing research on workbenches we want to do research on machine tools that can be used to build workbenches. Traditional PSEs deal with extending a workstation environment whereas this project is concerned with developing structured environments for problem-solving. Scientists and engineers collaborate when they solve problems, and they share much more than code. PSEs based on collaboration also provide object-request brokering and compound multimedia document interfaces. Since this vision is both novel and ambitious, a critical aspect of the project is leveraging methods and tools developed for scientific, commercial and home-computing applications.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Carroll 95-54206 We propose to create and evaluate an infrastructure for constructing and conducting experiments in a virtual laboratory. Our architecture will integrate existing and future Internet technology to support collaborative, highly interactive educational settings. Our prototype testbed will address physical science middle and high school students. The project represents a rational melding of existing technologies in new ways that we believe will do as much for active learning as the advent of World-Wide Web browsers such as Mosaic has done for passive browsing of information. Key elements of our proposal are: a participatory design approach involving teachers and students as design team members (in contrast to externally-imposed educational technology solutions). support for reuse of a wide variety of educational software available on the Internet (in contrast to requiring and assuming custom-designed educational applications). asynchronous extensions to interactive, collaborative environments (in contrast to the current dichotomy between non-interactive e-mail collaborations and strictly real-time interactions via MUDs and MOOs). multimedia extensions to interactive, collaborative environments (in contrast to teletype-style interactions currently supported by MUDs and MOOs). collaborative system support for heterogeneous platforms ranging from PCs to high-end workstations (in contrast to the assumption of homogenous computing environments). continuous on-site teacher support to help in selection and composition of project-oriented curriculum elements, community involvement in experimental projects, and evaluation of technology change, attitudes, and outcomes. This project seeks to leverage the technological and cultural opportunities of the Blacksburg Electronic Village (BEV), a densely interconnected community in rural Southwestern Virginia. It exploits the availability of Tl network connections to the four participating public schools. It builds upon an ongoing NIE Planning Grant, our ongoing work on participatory design of educational network applications, our ongoing work with computer aided education systems and software, and working relationships with Apple Computer, a company with years of commercial experience in supporting K-12 education. This project will develop the technical infrastructure necessary for solutions to educational issues and concepns of national significance: mitigating logistic obstacles to peer-based learning in rural settings. facilitating broad community involvement in public school activities. empowering teachers through their use of instructional technology. promoting more active roles for students in using World-Wide Web technology. increasing access to peer collaboration and laboratory experiences for students. enhancing participation in school activities for all students.</data>

Our prototype testbed will address physical science middle and high school students. The project represents a rational melding of existing technologies in new ways that we believe will do as much for active learning as the advent of World-Wide Web browsers such as Mosaic has done for passive browsing of information. Key elements of our proposal are: a participatory design approach involving teachers and students as design team members (in contrast to externally-imposed educational technology solutions). support for reuse of a wide variety of educational software available on the Internet (in contrast to requiring and assuming custom-designed educational applications). asynchronous extensions to interactive, collaborative environments (in contrast to the current dichotomy between non-interactive e-mail collaborations and strictly real-time interactions via MUDs and MOOs). multimedia extensions to interactive, collaborative environments (in contrast to teletype-style interactions currently supported by MUDs and MOOs). collaborative system support for heterogeneous platforms ranging from PCs to high-end workstations (in contrast to the assumption of homogenous computing environments). continuous on-site teacher support to help in selection and composition of project-oriented curriculum elements, community involvement in experimental projects, and evaluation of technology change, attitudes, and outcomes. This project seeks to leverage the technological and cultural opportunities of the Blacksburg Electronic Village (BEV), a densely interconnected community in rural Southwestern Virginia. It exploits the availability of Tl network connections to the four participating public schools. It builds upon an ongoing NIE Planning Grant, our ongoing work on participatory design of educational network applications, our ongoing work with computer aided education systems and software, and working relationships with Apple Computer, a company with years of commercial experience in supporting K-12 education. This project will develop the technical infrastructure necessary for solutions to educational issues and concepns of national significance: mitigating logistic obstacles to peer-based learning in rural settings. facilitating broad community involvement in public school activities. empowering teachers through their use of instructional technology. promoting more active roles for students in using World-Wide Web technology. increasing access to peer collaboration and laboratory experiences for students. enhancing participation in school activities for all students.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Flexible Shared Windows</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This research concerns infrastructure for supporting multiuser- interfaces. Two important criteria for evaluating such an infrastructure are the flexibility of the supported paradigms for (a) application-user interaction and (b) user-user sharing. Currently, an infrastructure offers either great interaction flexibility but limited sharing flexibility, or great sharing flexibility but limited interaction flexibility. The maximum interaction flexibility is offered by shared window systems, which allow multiple users to share a single logical window. However, these systems offer no sharing flexibility. The hypothesis of this research is that it is possible to significantly increase the sharing flexibility of these systems without reducing their interaction flexibility. This research identifies new software abstractions and architectures for establishing this hypothesis and uses an experimental method wherein the new concepts are implemented and used in validation experiments. If successful, it will lead to a new kind of infrastructure that automatically meets the sharing needs of a large class of multiuser user-interfaces that must today be implemented manually at great programming costs.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Mathematical Sciences: Representations of Three-Manifold Groups</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9505053 Casson Casson will study the Geometrization Conjecture for 3- dimensional manifolds, proposed by Thurston in 1982. A proof of this conjecture would complete the topological classification of closed 3-manifolds, provide insight into topological properties of 3-manifolds, and lead to efficient methods to determine whether two given 3-manifolds are topologically equivalent. Casson will explore a very direct approach to Thurston&apos;s conjecture; given a topological description of a 3-manifold M, he will attempt to find triangulations of M that are closely related to a geometric structure on M. Kirby will continue his work (often with Paul Melvin) in Topological Quantum Field Theory. He will try to explain the Kontsevich and Vassiliev invariants, using intersections of certain codimension-two manifolds in a compactification of products of the given 3-manifold with diagonals deleted. He will also continue to study the formulae for the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants, looking for topological interpretations and applications. Since the space that we live in is three-dimensional, and all our lives we perfect our three-dimensional geometric intuition simply by going about our everyday business, it is always surprising to the layman to learn that mathematicians&apos; are frequently more capable of answering questions about higher dimensional geometric objects than about the analogous objects in dimension three. This is, however, very much the case. The most famous outstanding conjecture in topology is the three-dimensional Poincare conjecture, made at the turn of the century. On the other hand, its higher dimensional analogues have all been settled. The research of this project is directly addressed to these notoriously recalcitrant problems. ***</data>
