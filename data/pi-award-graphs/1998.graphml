      <data key="e_title">Demand for quality-differentiated network services</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Future growth of Internet and other network services depends upon how these services are marketed. Two decisions are involved: the division of services into quality-differentiated market segments, and the pricing structure of each segment. There is evidence of diversity in user demand for service quality depending on application, familiarity, and willingness to pay. On the supply side, network technology now can support a wide range of service quality. Successful growth therefore requires service providers to offer combinations of quality and price that match user need. But to do this providers must understand the structure of user demand. Such understanding is lacking at present. This is a proposal for a market experiment to estimate the demand for network services. INDEX---the Internet Demand Experiment---has three objectives: 1. Measurement of user demand for Internet access as a function of quality of service (QoS), pricing structure, and application; 2. Demonstration of an end-to-end system that provides access to a diverse group of users at attractive price-quality combinations; 3. Development of a prototype system that can be scaled to serve the demand for remote network access from all Berkeley students, faculty and staff on a user-financed basis. The experiment will recruit 160 students, faculty and staff from the Berkeley campus community. Users will select and pay for network services from a menu of QoS-price offerings. User decisions will be monitored and the data will be used to estimate their structure of demand. The experiment will produce a unique set of data that can be analyzed to characterize individual and aggregate network traffic and to evaluate strategies for managing network resources to accommodate diverse user needs.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9729904 Bowyer, Kevin W. University of South Florida CISE Research Instrumentation: Acquisition of a Compute Server for Image Analysis Research that Emphasizes Empirical Performance Characterization This research instrumentation grant contributes to the purchase of a compute server for the lab research network at USF with four 250 Mhz UltraSparc Processors, 1GB main memory, 35 GB of formatted disk pace, and a tape drive, which will enable the following projects:- Automated Performance Evaluation of Edge Detectors,- Nonrigid Motion and Structure Recovery from 2D Views, - Performance Evaluation of Perceptual Organization Modules, and - Automatic Tumor Volume Extraction from Brain MRI. This project deals with four image analysis tasks: performance analysis of edge detector algorithms, algorithms for analysis of non-rigid motion in image sequences, the development and analysis of perceptual grouping algorithms, and the development of clustering-based algorithms for the segmentation of magnetic resonance images. These tasks are all computationally expensive. In addition, the studied empirical characterization of the performance of the algorithms is emphasized. This style of research presents enormous computational demands, and it is not feasible to conduct this style of research with the typical workstation that an individual user would have on their desk. To make it practical to carry out this research, USL will acquire a compute server that will provide much greater computational power. This compute server will be shared among the research projects. Each of the projects is innovative and will lead to high-quality publications. In addition, the data sets and empirical methods that are created in these projects will have substantial impact on future research.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9729904 Bowyer, Kevin W. University of South Florida CISE Research Instrumentation: Acquisition of a Compute Server for Image Analysis Research that Emphasizes Empirical Performance Characterization This research instrumentation grant contributes to the purchase of a compute server for the lab research network at USF with four 250 Mhz UltraSparc Processors, 1GB main memory, 35 GB of formatted disk pace, and a tape drive, which will enable the following projects:- Automated Performance Evaluation of Edge Detectors,- Nonrigid Motion and Structure Recovery from 2D Views, - Performance Evaluation of Perceptual Organization Modules, and - Automatic Tumor Volume Extraction from Brain MRI. This project deals with four image analysis tasks: performance analysis of edge detector algorithms, algorithms for analysis of non-rigid motion in image sequences, the development and analysis of perceptual grouping algorithms, and the development of clustering-based algorithms for the segmentation of magnetic resonance images. These tasks are all computationally expensive. In addition, the studied empirical characterization of the performance of the algorithms is emphasized. This style of research presents enormous computational demands, and it is not feasible to conduct this style of research with the typical workstation that an individual user would have on their desk. To make it practical to carry out this research, USL will acquire a compute server that will provide much greater computational power. This compute server will be shared among the research projects. Each of the projects is innovative and will lead to high-quality publications. In addition, the data sets and empirical methods that are created in these projects will have substantial impact on future research.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Virtual Environment Interfaces to Physical Environments: A Tool for Cooperative Research in Experimental Robotics</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The goal is to develop a computer system to support geographically separated researchers performing cooperative experimental research in robotics. This system uses vision techniques under the control of smart planners to acquire a visual model (combining 3-D data and texture maps) of the physical environment where the experiment takes place. It provides real-time graphic renderings of the experiments on the researchers&apos; graphic workstations along individually selected viewpoints. Hence, each researcher is able to OBSERVE the experiments using his/her own controllable virtual camera. The initial exploration will focus on one major component of the envisioned system, the automatic construction of a 3-D model of an experimental robotic site. This will be used to analyze basic issues that will also be encountered in the other components of the envisioned system, in particular the effect of uncertainty on the interaction between a user and a remote experimental site. This is a collaborative effort between R. Bajcsy of the GRASP laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania and J. C. Latombe at Stanford University.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goals of this research are to determine the usefulness of genetic algorithms in designing spatially extended, parallel systems to perform computational tasks. An important and novel component of this project is the development of appropriate theoretical frameworks for understanding both the computational strategies of the systems evolved by the genetic algorithm as well as the evolutionary process by which such strategies are designed. This research will make three major contributions: (1) advances in the study of how spatially extended parallel systems perform computations; (2) advances in the theory and practice of genetic algorithms; and (3) a foundation for applications to parallel computation problems such as image processing, noise reduction, texture detection, and the automatic discovery of coherent structures in image time series.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9729828 Chaudhary, Vipin Wayne State University CISE Research Instrumentation: High Performance Computing on an ATM-Connected Cluster of Symmetric Multiprocessors This research instrumentation grant serves to support the purchase of one Sun Enterprise 4000 (with 6 processors), two Sun Enterprises 3000 (4 processors each), and a 12-port Switch with 8 ATM interfaces which will enable the following projects:- Development of an Automatic Parallelization Environment (APE) for Scientific Engineering Programs in a Cluster of SMPs,- Real Time Optimization of #D Conformal Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning, - Parallel Techniques for 3D Cone Beam Tomography, and- Measurement of Resource Requirements for ATM ABR Connections. The first project integrates compile-time and run-time parallelization techniques focusing on loops with non-linear subscripts on a cluster of SMPs. An implementation of APE will reduce the execution time for various scientific and engineering applications. The second project serves radiation therapy where current computer assisted optimization techniques are too slow or too expensive to be adopted in clinical practice. Genetic algorithms will be used to optimize the dosage. A real-time cost effective implementation on a cluster of multiprocessors will make the planning process applicable in clinical practice. The third project encounters the bottleneck in parallel implementation of 3D Cone Beam Tomography technique on ethernet in the low bandwidth of the network. Using the virtual connectivity provided by ATM, the multiphase broadcast can be efficiently implemented. Results from this implementation will apply to other problems like volumetric imaging applications and finite element analysis of 3D structures. The last project utilizes profile data from various applications to enable sources to request just the necessary bandwidth and facilitate fair allocation of bandwidth.

      <data key="e_abstract">9729828 Chaudhary, Vipin Wayne State University CISE Research Instrumentation: High Performance Computing on an ATM-Connected Cluster of Symmetric Multiprocessors This research instrumentation grant serves to support the purchase of one Sun Enterprise 4000 (with 6 processors), two Sun Enterprises 3000 (4 processors each), and a 12-port Switch with 8 ATM interfaces which will enable the following projects:- Development of an Automatic Parallelization Environment (APE) for Scientific Engineering Programs in a Cluster of SMPs,- Real Time Optimization of #D Conformal Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning, - Parallel Techniques for 3D Cone Beam Tomography, and- Measurement of Resource Requirements for ATM ABR Connections. The first project integrates compile-time and run-time parallelization techniques focusing on loops with non-linear subscripts on a cluster of SMPs. An implementation of APE will reduce the execution time for various scientific and engineering applications. The second project serves radiation therapy where current computer assisted optimization techniques are too slow or too expensive to be adopted in clinical practice. Genetic algorithms will be used to optimize the dosage. A real-time cost effective implementation on a cluster of multiprocessors will make the planning process applicable in clinical practice. The third project encounters the bottleneck in parallel implementation of 3D Cone Beam Tomography technique on ethernet in the low bandwidth of the network. Using the virtual connectivity provided by ATM, the multiphase broadcast can be efficiently implemented. Results from this implementation will apply to other problems like volumetric imaging applications and finite element analysis of 3D structures. The last project utilizes profile data from various applications to enable sources to request just the necessary bandwidth and facilitate fair allocation of bandwidth. It will permit a better utilization of the network resources and improve the application perf ormance.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9729839 Uht, Augustus K. University of Rhode Island Research Instrumentation: Equipment for Diverse Computer Architecture Research This research instrumentation grant enables three distinct research projects: - Realizing Instruction Level Parallelism in the 10&apos;s - A New Spectrum of Hierarchical Storage Architectures for High Performance Disk I/Os - Ultra-Dependable and High-Performance Distributed Computing while seeking to improve computer performance in many dimensions: uni- or micro-processors, I/O (Input/Output) systems, and multiple-computer systems. Further, the reliability of multiple-computer systems is to be enhanced. These objectives are to be achieved by using the new instrumentation equipment (multiprocessor and multiple-disk RAID storage system) in several different ways. First, the Levo research prototype uniprocessor is to be designed and simulated on the new multiprocessor. The latter will serve to verify Levo&apos;s implementation and measure its performance, as well as to allow Levo&apos;s construction, establishing that uniprocessors can be designed to execute an order-of-magnitude more instructions per cycle than current uniprocessors. Second, since I/O constraints can limit overall performance, the novel Disk Caching Disk (DCD) I/O system is to be realized on the new multiprocessor and RAID equipment, demonstrating factors of 2 to orders-of-magnitude performance improvements of the DCD architecture. Lastly, the Active Nodal Task Seeking (ANTS) distributed computing system achieves high performance and ultra-dependability in a coarse-grain environment. The new ANTS kernel is to be realized on the new multiprocessor, showing that the same can be achieved on fine-grain applications.</data>

The most important asset of a professional organization is its people: more specifically, their accumulated knowledge and potential insights. When these knowledge workers collaborate, they are achieving learning for themselves and their organization. Groupware (including Intranets) is used to facilitate their collaborative work. The proposed research addresses first how use of groupware will improve both the decision effectiveness and efficiency of collaboration by geographically distributed professionals and second under what conditions will teams make available their decisions and decision processes to permit an organization to acquire, manage and distribute their knowledge. Members of teams of knowledge workers will communicate, exchange information, and make decisions, in the to-be-established Groupware Laboratory for which the networking, workstation and videoconferencing instrumentation is needed. The instrumentation, to be installed in soundproof cubicles, will permit simulation and study of how professionals &quot;interact&quot; using only digital (and voice) interaction when they are geographically distributed. This use of a &quot;digital communication&quot; laboratory permits control of extraneous variables (e.g., access to unknown parties and information) and concentrates on discovery of new causal effects.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9729843 Wright, William F. University of California - Irvine CISE Research Instrumentation :Use of Groupware to Enhance Team Decisions and Achieve Organizational Learning This research instrumentation grant contributes to enable the following projects:- Better Collaborative User of Information Using Groupware: Use of Considerable Information and Use of Multimedia Information,- When will Team Members Collaborate Effectively?: The Impact of Team Leadership and Team Cohesion on Collaborative Use of Groupware, and- Use of Groupware to Acquire Organizational Memory: Framing of Case Descriptions and Incentives for Teams to Contribute. The most important asset of a professional organization is its people: more specifically, their accumulated knowledge and potential insights. When these knowledge workers collaborate, they are achieving learning for themselves and their organization. Groupware (including Intranets) is used to facilitate their collaborative work. The proposed research addresses first how use of groupware will improve both the decision effectiveness and efficiency of collaboration by geographically distributed professionals and second under what conditions will teams make available their decisions and decision processes to permit an organization to acquire, manage and distribute their knowledge. Members of teams of knowledge workers will communicate, exchange information, and make decisions, in the to-be-established Groupware Laboratory for which the networking, workstation and videoconferencing instrumentation is needed. The instrumentation, to be installed in soundproof cubicles, will permit simulation and study of how professionals &quot;interact&quot; using only digital (and voice) interaction when they are geographically distributed. This use of a &quot;digital communication&quot; laboratory permits control of extraneous variables (e.g., access to unknown parties and information) and concentrates on discovery of new causal effects.</data>

The goal is to improve existing parallel implementations for effective clinical usage. The techniques employed combine the technologies of artificial neural networks and wavelet transforms. - MCD (Multiple Complete Digestion) Mapping: Research will continue on a form of high-resolution, restriction-fragment DNA mapping (MCD mapping). The mapping problem is fundamental to DNA based genetic research. With genomes of enormous size (millions to billions of base pairs), even relatively simple support activities such as software testing are extremely time consuming. The requested equipment will be used to develop parallel algorithms which are faster and more accurate. - Discrete-Event Simulation: Research will continue on developing parallel discrete-event simulation algorithms for modeling large computer communications networks. Effective network designs are needed for the continued expansion and improvement of the Internet and World Wide Web.

      <data key="e_abstract">In the Internet today, packet losses are typically recovered using retransmission, as for example in TCP. The mechanism employed in TCP works well in the unicast environment. In multicast environment, however, such as the MBone, the TCP approach does not work well, especially when the multicast groups are very large. Difficulties arise because of two main problems: implosion and exposure. Implosion occurs when following a packet loss, many receivers multicast the same request; implosion also occurs when in response to a request, many receivers multicast the lost packet. Exposure occurs when requests and retransmissions reach members that have not experienced loss. Both implosion and exposure cause unecessary overhead. Existing solutions are not general because of the trade-offs they offer for reducing implosion and exposure. SRM for example, trades latency for reducing implosion, and uses a crude method for reducing exposure. RMTP, TMTP and LBRRM reduce both implosion and exposure by arranging members in a tree. The tree, however, is hard to construct and maintain in the face of dynamically changing groups without any access to topology information. We propose a new scheme to perform reliable multicast which overcomes the limitations of existing solutions. Our scheme is based on a dynamic tree hierarchy, but pushes the task of costructing and maintaining the tree to the network, where it can be done very efficiently. To achieve this, we enhance the IP Multicast service model by adding new forwarding services to the routers. The scheme combines three ideas to achieve near optimal performance: (a) electing a replier link at each router to eliminate implosion, (b) defining the concept of a &quot;turning point&quot; to discover the subtree where loss occurred, and (c) using &quot;directed multicast&quot; to limit replies to the loss subtree. These ideas minimize recovery latency and allow group members to be completely isolated from the details of group topology, thus allowing fast adaptation to dynamic membership changes.</data>

The PL/PS architecture breaks each task in a program into three phases: load, compute, and store. Separating the phases of each task allows greater flexiblity in scheduling the code and provides a means of hiding memory and communication latencies.

      <data key="e_title">Learning and Inference with Schemas and Analogies</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project will extend and test a theory and computer model of human reasoning. People routinely reason using schemas, knowledge structures that describe general situations, events, rules, or relationships. For example, a Restaurant schema might specify the kinds of events that take place in restaurants, and the relationships between the actors in those events (e.g., chefs, waiters, customers); a Family Relation schema might specify the kinds of relationships that define various family members, such as sisters, brothers, parents, and uncles. A schema is both general, in that it refers to many specific situations, and highly structured, in that it specifies the relationships between objects, events, or even between other relationships. Psychologists and computer scientists have long recognized the utility of schemas as a basis for reasoning: If one can recognize an object or situation as an instance of a general schema, then one can use the schema to reason about that object or situation. Although the generality and structured nature of schemas make them extremely useful, these features also make schemas very difficult to model. Traditional symbolic approaches to computer modeling are good at representing structured information, but they have difficulty in flexibly matching specific instances to general facts; by contrast, connectionist models are good at flexibly matching instances to general categories, but they have great difficulty representing structured information (such as rules and relationships). We have recently developed a theory of human schema-based learning and reasoning, and implemented this theory as a working computer model. The model, called LISA (Learning and Inference with Schemas and Analogies), combines the flexibility of a connectionist architecture with the capacity to represent and learn relational structures. The resulting system can (a) learn general schemas from specific examples, (b) match new instances to learned schemas, and (c) use the schemas to make inductive inferences about the new examples. LISA makes several novel predictions about human learning and reasoning. Part of the NSF-supported research will be a series of experiments to test these predictions. Another part of the research will extend the LISA model to account for aspects of human story and event comprehension (e.g., If someone tells us `There are four plates per tray,` how do we know that this means each tray will hold, or contain, four plates?), and aspects of spatial reasoning (e.g., If we are told that Bill is taller than Charles and Abe is taller than Bill, how do we figure out that Abe is taller than Charles?). Importantly, the extended LISA model will account for these seemingly different capacities (as well as other capacities, such as reasoning by analogy) in terms of the same basic mechanisms as it uses to account for our ability to reason using schemas. The knowledge gained from the project will contribute to the development of methods for enhancing human learning and reasoning abilities, and also to the development of artificially intelligent systems.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Abstract for the web page http://tesla.csl.uiuc.edu/~srikant/~wireless.html Fair scheduling of delay and rate-sensitive packet flows over a wireless channel is not addressed effectively by most contemporary wireline fair scheduling algorithms because of two unique characteristics of wireless media: (a) bursty channel errors, and (b) location-dependent channel capacity and errors. Besides, in packet cellular networks, the base station typically performs the task of packet scheduling for both downlink and uplink flows in a cell; however a base station has only a limited knowledge of the arrival processes of uplink flows. Fair scheduling is closely connected to admission control and channel measurements since these are used to allocate a fraction of the channel&apos;s capacity to each flow based or its Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. In this proposal, we will study the problem of admission control and scheduling together. Most previous work has addressed these two problems separately in the context of wireline networks, but such an approach is not applicable to wireless networks. On-line measurements will be used along with admission control, scheduling and rate adaption to provide good QoS performance. We plan to use on-line measurements to estimate the parameters of simple stochastic processes (such as on-off Markov models) describing the channel state. Off-line measurements would be used to validate and refine our prediction algorithm as well as to develop a simple model for the channel which can used by the on-line measurement algorithm. We will also study the impact of fair wireless packet scheduling on medium access and develop an effective MAC protocol to support simple rate and delay guarantees. Finally, using existing testbeds, we will evaluate the algorithms that result from this research project.</data>

The UNH team are experts on the construction of compilers and run-time systems for parallel computers. The ENS-Lyon researchers have recognized expertise in design, transformation and validation of parallel proposals, as well as expertise in programming environments based upon multithreading. These complementary strengths will be brought together to study issues such as: the utility of multithreaded implementations of data-parallel programming languages, the compilation of Java programs for high performance execution on clusters of multiprocessor PCs, and the utilization of thread migration to effect load balancing in both data-parallel and Java programs.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9726401 Riseman, Edward Finn, John University of Massachusetts, Amherst Challenges in CISE: Automatic Interpretation of High-Altitude Image Data for Eco-System Modeling The goal of the joint research effort between the University of Massachusetts Computer Science Department and the Department of Forestry and Wildlife Management is the development and demonstration of a practical methodology to enable highly automated and accurate scientific monitoring of natural resource and land use via aerial video and photography. A secondary goal is to use portions of the same system for wildlife surveys and management. The research project will almost completely automate and significantly extend the manual methodology currently in use involving airborne video data collection, time-consuming manual image registration, and construction of customized expert system classifiers for vegetation and terrain cover. Thus the proposed computer science research spans technical issues in computer vision, machine learning, and high performance computing.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">A one day meeting, called the East Coast Computer Algebra Day (ECCAD), will be held at the US Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, on April 25, 1998. This series of meetings has become a regular event for the region, with different academic and industrial institutions hosting the meeting in rotation. The purpose of this meeting is to stimulate interest in and enhance understanding of the technical aspects of computer algebra, by providing a way for those in the region who are active or interested in becoming more active in computer algebra to meet with each other in an inexpensive and easily accessible way. This meeting is more informal than the annual ISSAC meetings, with ample time for unstructured interaction. Participation by the region&apos;s graduate students is particularly encouraged through special invitation to contribute to the poster sessions, and through travel support. Three invited lectures will anchor the meeting and will help attract participants. The invited talks and poster sessions contributed by the community will cover the breadth of computer algebra: algorithms, software, and applications.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This award supports Dr. Jan Prins, co-PI Siddhartha Chatterjee, and a graduate student from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in a collaboration with Stefan Jªhnichen of the Department of Communications and Software Engineering at the Technical University of Berlin. The collaboration will study high-performance computing with the aim of integrating nested parallelism into the High Performance Fortran (HPF) and Fortran 95 programming languages. (HPF is a variant of Fortran 95 specifically targeted for programming high-performance parallel computers in a way that does not depend on the computer architecture.) The time is right to incorporate this new technology into Fortran so that applications can take advantage of the capability without disrupting ongoing development. Nested parallelism enables the expression of adaptive and sparse solution techniques necessary to performing increasingly large and precise scientific computations. The collaboration combines the complementary strengths and facilities of the two research groups.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Under flash-crowd conditions, where congestion arises near the server because a large number of users wish to retrieve files from it over a short period of time, users are in a unique position to benefit enormously from each other by sharing retrieved files. Pseudo-serving, a new paradigm for Internet access, provides incentives for users to contribute to the speedy dissemination of server files through a contract set by a super-server. Under this contract, the super-server grants a user a referral to where a copy of the requested file may be retrieved in exchange for her assurance to serve other users for a specified period of time. In this proposed project, we will investigate issues that must be resolved in order to make pseudo-serving an effective tool for dissipating flash-crowds on the Internet. This includes issues related to the acceptability of the contract to the user, the ability of the super-server to set contracts that account for the physical distribution of sources of the requests, security issues and various approaches in dealing with contract breaches, and strategies for integrating pseudo-serving into various caching policies. The outcome of this research will help the World Wide Web to scale more gracefully and provide a mechanism through which users can barter their local resources for preferential access to information from busy servers.</data>

The students will work on projects involving the design and construction of autonomous robots and machine learning. After building their own robot, the students will study, develop, and test machine learning algorithms by implementing them in their own enhanced autonomous agent. Student participants are recruited from institutions throughout the Southeast and Southwest with particular effort directed at students from several of the HBCUs in the area. REU participants will be able to maintain a web page on the project web site for a period of two years on which to post new developments on their platforms, after the actual REU session is over.</data>

Applications will be considered from students from colleges and universities nationwide. Students will participate in an individual research project supervised by a Physics Department faculty member. Students will be integrated into research groups of their supervisors, giving them a first-hand view of research in an academic setting. Student projects will include experimental, theoretical and computational research in high energy physics, condensed matter physics, biophysics, plasma physics, astrophysics, and nonlinear physics. The research projects will be designed to lead students from a dependent research status to one which will allow each student to become as independent as their research skills and abilities permit.

      <data key="e_abstract">9726724 Regan This award supports a three year collaborative research project between Professor Kenneth Regan of SUNY, Buffalo and Professor Osamu Watanabe of the Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan. The researchers will undertake a study of complexity theory for strategic goals. The main objective is the development of more refined tools for analyzing the complexity of computations than are currently most commonly employed in the field. Particular areas to be investigated include: (1) linear and quasi-linear time reductions between problems, (2) low-level circuit-based classes and reductions, often with quasi-linear bounds on circuit size, (3) average-case complexity, including a determination of which of several competing polynomial-time formalisms is best suited for lower time bound analysis, and (4) a new theory of one- way functions that realize certain concrete polynomial complexity gaps, such as being quasilinear-time computable but not inevitable in less than quadratic time. This project brings together the efforts of scientists, in both countries, that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The development of a more acute analysis of computational costs should help gauge its practical effectiveness now, and its strategic potential as a guide for future investigations. Extending theories of (quasi-)linear time and of low-level classes and reductions should provide a precise understanding of what facets of problems make them hard to solve and how these facets are related between problems. It is further expected that it will be possible to understand the relationship between average-case complexity and the nature-and-distribution of such hard instances. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation. ***</data>

Particular areas to be investigated include: (1) linear and quasi-linear time reductions between problems, (2) low-level circuit-based classes and reductions, often with quasi-linear bounds on circuit size, (3) average-case complexity, including a determination of which of several competing polynomial-time formalisms is best suited for lower time bound analysis, and (4) a new theory of one- way functions that realize certain concrete polynomial complexity gaps, such as being quasilinear-time computable but not inevitable in less than quadratic time. This project brings together the efforts of scientists, in both countries, that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The development of a more acute analysis of computational costs should help gauge its practical effectiveness now, and its strategic potential as a guide for future investigations. Extending theories of (quasi-)linear time and of low-level classes and reductions should provide a precise understanding of what facets of problems make them hard to solve and how these facets are related between problems. It is further expected that it will be possible to understand the relationship between average-case complexity and the nature-and-distribution of such hard instances. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This meeting is to bring together researchers who have applied methods for learning from delayed reward to real- world problems and to review progress along these lines. The invited speakers represent different theoretical paradigms, and the focus of the meeting on applied problems will encourage communication across traditional disciplinary boundaries. A review paper will be produced for distribution to the research community that summarizes the results of the workshop and should encourage further basic research in learning, in order to increase the breadth and effectiveness of applications.</data>

In addition to measuring and analyzing vBNS traffic data, NLANR/MOAT will promote the continued development, testing and deployment of publicly-available measurement and analysis tools and techniques. NLANR/MOAT will facilitate the early identification and analisis of performance (both network-centric and applications-centric) trends and problems (related to the VBNS and interconnected High Performance networks and institutions). This will be accomplished by deploying flow monitors and conducting performance measurements on HPC connections to the vBNS, on select vBNS partner nodes, and at other key sites (particularly vBNS aggregation points, such as GigaPOPs and NGIXen). Resulting data and analysis on Internet traffic performance and traffic flows will then be made available to the research community and the general public.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">98-05604 Cleaveland, Walter R. North Carolina State University CISE PostDoc: Verification Tool for Net-based Programming This project is devoted to the development of effective automated techniques for modeling and reasoning about the correctness of network-based software. The motivation for the project arises from the exploding popularity of programming in net-based languages like Java coupled with the fact that an incorrectly functioning net-oriented program can inflict serious damage on a whole network and not just on a single site within the network. The methods to be used by the research effort are based on those used successfully in the analysis of finite-state systems such as communications protocols and in the rigorous modeling of programming language constructs. The PI has substantial experience in the former but very little with the latter; the addition of a postdoctoral research associate with a background in the latter is therefore essential for the project&apos;s anticipated results---a collection of techniques, and associated tools, for analyzing automatically the safety and fault-tolerance of mobile code---to be achieved.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9805823 Amato, Nancy M. Trinkle, Jeffrey, C. Texas A&amp;M University CISE PostDoc: Real-Time Multibody Dynamics for Virtual Environment Training Systems with Haptic User Interfaces In USA today, about 5% of the industrial salary base is spent on training. Training systems based on virtual environments (VE) will enable workers to practice operating new equipment before it is installed, and perhaps more importantly, will allow the results of improper operation to be simulated without incurring the associated costs. The biggest deficiency in VE systems is their inability to animate the motions of bodies in contact. For example, a dropped wrench will usually either magically disappear from the virtual scene, or accelerate through all obstacles in its path. This project will develop fundamental technical results and algorithms needed to: (1) embed the physics of moving bodies into the underlying motion simulator, (2) allow two-way interaction between the user and the VE through a haptic device, (3) provide a system to help workers plan complex maintenance tasks, and (4) systematically analyze the effects of uncertainty in the parameters of the dynamic and geometric models of the VE. The postdoctoral researcher will participate in the high-level design of the VE training system, and will have primary responsibility for one or more of the system components. His/her expertise will enable the project to produce a higher-quality, more robust system.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Networking and Telecommunications Task Force of Educom (NTTF) and FARNET The NSF vBNS program is nearing the end of its 5-year award. As is described in its 1997 midterm review, the vBNS is widely recognized for essential contributions to the development of U.S. capabilities for advanced networking for R&amp;D. In its first three years of service, for example, the vBNS has: - accelerated the planning and implementation of the Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infrastructure, - enabled the interconnection of the Internet2 universities and partners, - served as the core national network for goal 2.1 of the Next Generation Internet project, - supported remote computing and collaborations for significant advances in the sciences and engineering, and - led to the design and improvement of high-performance network technology in the commercial sector. The vBNS expert review concluded with a very strong recommendation that NSF continue its support for advanced networking for research and development after the scheduled conclusion of the present vBNS award. It is now time, therefore, to examine developments in technology and the environment since the vBNS program was designed and to reach sound recommendations on how NSF might best support its goals for the continued development of advanced networking in the coming years. This project intends to organize and oversee a formal process that captures and summarizes the best creative thinking of both experts and generalists in the U.S. community for advanced networking. The result will be a final document and supporting material outlining the major issues and objectives to be addressed by NSF in its follow-on program to the vBNS.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Research in High-Frequency Analog Electronic Circuits for Communication Systems</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This research is concerned with the creation of new methods of electronic circuit design which will allow realization of smaller size, longer battery life and lower cost in personal communication systems such as cellular telephones, cordless telephones and wireless computer networks. In addition, new transceiver architectures are being investigated which will allow multistandard operation which is transparent to the user. Thus, a single personal communication handset could be used anywhere in the world as it automatically adjusts to different local standards and frequencies. Current implementations of portable transceivers typically use a multi-chip, multi-technology approach with a number of precision external filters, resonators, and other components in order to meet the stringent performance requirement of the analog RF interface in such systems. These transitional approaches severely limit the achievable levels of power dissipation and form factor, and are not compatible with low- cost adaptive multistandard operation. This research is exploring new architectures and circuit techniques which will allow utilization of scaled CMOS VLSI technology to integrate the entire transceiver function with only a few external components. The challenge is to find new approaches that overcome the inherent limitations of integrated passive components such as low Q values in integrated inductors, capacitors and varactors, by utilization of the inherently high bandwidth capabilities of scaled integrated MOS transistors. The investigators expect to demonstrate at the end of this research project a single-chip multistandard RF transceiver incorporating synthesizers, transmit path, power amplifier, and receive path as well as providing interface to several different RF standards. This prototype will be implemented in 0.35 micron CMOS technology.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Refining Program Specifications by Automatic Transformation</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9803880 Productivity benefits and quality improvement have come about as a result of designing and implementing software at ever higher levels of abstraction. So called &quot;executable specifications&quot;-high level functional descriptions of software-represent the current state of language development for software design. However, software is rarely implemented by directly translating such specifications, as the performance of the resulting product is usually poor. To remedy the performance problem without requiring human effort to reprogram a specification as an implementation, the use of program transformation has often been suggested, rewriting the specification according to rules that preserve its meaning but change its form. The technology of transformational improvement has made progress over a span of twenty years. Several functional language compilers now achieve substantial performance gains through the use of source-language transformations. Many improvements remain to be made, however. This research will build on recent and promising results that improve the performance of recursively defined functions by applying transformations based upon their underlying mathematics. Prototype systems have shown the potential of some of these methods, but these systems have never been fully implemented, integrated, or tested. In particular, this research will integrate a variety of known techniques that are expected to work more powerfully in concert than individually. In this project, a prototype transformation system will be extended so that it can be applied to programs written in a core subset of the programming language Standard ML, as well as in CAML, an ML dialect widely used in Europe. The research will help to determine whether high-level transformations can be effective enough in improving the performance of high-level specifications that software designers might quit worrying about many details of programming.***</data>

Foundational issues for goal (a) include the model theory and proof theory of abstract data types with mutable objects, subtyping, aliasing, and message passing. The model theory of our previous work is extended to account for nondeterminism and higher-order procedures. In proof theory, equational reasoning techniques for reasoning about immutable objects are sought. These results are to be connected with verification logics for OO languages with the new feature of multimethods. Goal (b) helps vendors explain OO class libraries and frameworks to customers without giving them source code, which cannot be done with existing BISLs. This project provides: guidance for the design of more expressive OO specification languages, ideas for use in documentation of OO class libraries and frameworks, and expressive notations for specification.

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this project is to study both practical and theoretical aspects surrounding the application and implementation of algorithms for computing stationary probabilities and analyzing transient behavior of discrete Markov chains. One facet of the research is dedicated to applications of discrete models for understanding and analyzing the dynamics of large systems comprised of collections of loosely coupled subsystems such as in the study of queuing models and networks, telecommunications, computer performance evaluation, stochastic automata networks, economic and biological forecasting, and flexible manufacturing systems. Special attention is devoted to making Markov chain technology widely available to researchers in diverse areas. Specific research objectives include the following aims. (1) The project seeks to relate properties of specific Markov chain models to characteristics of numerical algorithms with the goal of devising a sieve from which the most appropriate algorithm and implementation for a given application can be extracted. (2) Another objective is to develop both theoretical and numerical mechanisms to facilitate the determination or estimation of stationary probabilities of large-scale finite Markov chains by utilizing a variety of aggregation/disaggregation methods. A specific goal is to formulate a comprehensive theory of errors which can simplify and unify the analysis of a broad range of aggregation/disaggregation processes and algorithms. (3) The project seeks to develop practical preconditioning techniques for iterative algorithms which can be applied to Markov models which are formulated as stochastic automata networks. (4) A final objective is to develop a comprehensive software package which provides access to sophisticated computational tools for Markov modeling. The goal is to structure the package for researchers in applications areas who do not want to be diverted by or become immersed in technical numerical analysis details.</data>

Purdue University CISE PostDoc: Computational Methods in VLSI Design This research project will develop innovative computational methods and software for problems in electromagnetics arising in VLSI design. The project focuses on developing robust, effective, and parallelizable solvers and preconditioners for linear systems arising from finite element and boundary element modeling of inductive and capacitive effects in high speed integrated circuits. Techniques based on a hierarchy of representations using multipoles and block low-rank approximations of the coefficient matrix are investigated. The implications of these techniques for approximate inverse preconditioners and multilevel schemes for sparse solvers are also addressed. Portable parallel formulations of the techniques along with theoretical estimates for convergence and parallel performance are targeted. In addition to development of innovative techniques and training of the post-doctoral research associate, this project serves to strengthen the recent initiative in computational electromagnetics at Purdue University. The presence of a post-doctoral researcher in electromagnetics also complements the PIs&apos; areas of expertise, contributing to the interdisciplinary nature of the project.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Developing a Theory of Heuristics</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Current theory does little to predict, explain or analyze the empirically observed success of search and optimization heuristics for some domains of NP-complete problem and their failure for others. Without such a theory, implementers of heuristics have no guidance as to whether a particular heuristic method is suitable for a particular problem domain, what kind of performance to expect, or how to set the various parameters for better performance. Implementation is often done in a haphazard way based on little more than guess-work or trial-and-error. The following inter-related lines of theoretical research will be explored to address this gap: (1) Extending average-case complexity to consider reductions to and between problem distributions that arise naturally ( in real-life, testing, cryptanalysis or combinatorics). (2) Extending average-case analysis techniques to a more general characterization of the relevant combinatorial properties of random problem instances from naturally arising distributions. In particular, the properties of associated search spaces for such problems. (3) For experimentally successful heuristic methods, identify the combinatorial characteristics of problem instances that determine their performance.

      <data key="e_abstract">This project studies approximation algorithms for NP-Hard optimization problems. Many of these are important, real-world problems. Because for these problems there probably are no efficient, exact algorithms, the project studies approximation algorithms. These algorithms are guaranteed to be fast and to return a near-optimal answer. Either this near-optimal solution can be used directly, or it can be used as a starting point for a heuristic which attempts to improve the solution. Among the problems studied are MAX SAT, the problem of satisfying as many disjunctions as possible in a given set of disjunctions of Boolean literals, variants of MULTICUT, which involve finding, in a graph, a smallest set of edges whose removal disconnects given vertices; and STEINER TREE, the problem, given a graph, of finding a cheap subgraph which connects a given set of terminals.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9804087 Data abstraction is of central concern in program design while ``parametricity&apos;&apos; is a mathematical formalization of this concept. Using parametricity, one can argue that two program modules that export types and operations are equivalent as long as the behavior observable by client programs is the same. In this project, Prof. Uday Reddy addresses key issues of parametricity theory in joint research with Prof. Peter O&apos;Hearn at Queen Mary and Westfield, London. The issues addressed include finding an abstract framework for parametricity that encompasses various programming language phenomena and their mathematical models, integrating parametricity with subtyping type systems, and the application of these results for modeling object-oriented programming with mutable state. The research spans theoretical and practical issues, ranging from abstract categorical frameworks to type systems and practical reasoning principles. The issues addressed are of vital importance for integrating parametricity with the vast body of programming theory developed over the years. Prof. O&apos;Hearn&apos;s expertise in parametricity theory will complement Reddy&apos;s work in the study of data abstraction aspects of local variables. This collaboration enhances their research effectiveness in addressing issues of mutual interest.***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The common good of our information infrastructure depends on well designed network security that is embraced by the public and private sectors. Well designed network security requires well formed technical mechanisms and responsiveness to underlying moral and societal values, as well as a well thought out system of user interactions. In recent years, significant efforts have been directed toward developing the technical dimensions of network security, but little systematic work investigates and integrates the corresponding dimensions of human values and user experience. This collaborative project provides a model of interdisciplinary collaboration that can deepen our understanding of the cognitive, ethical and social implications of new types of inter-activity. It will study and implement security for a network browser that integrates these three key considerations: technical excellence, responsiveness to moral and societal values, and sensitivity to users&apos; perceptions. It will: (1) develop a conceptual framework, or model, for network security that accounts for human values and user experience; (2) design and implement a working prototype of a network security system guided by the conceptual model; and (3) apply the experience of this project toward a better understanding of methodology for the general purpose of designing technology that is responsive to human values. Drawing on the technical, philosophical, and social science expertise of the three investigators, the work will begin with a close study of the network security in existing browsers such as Netscape 4.0 and Internet Explorer 4.0. The goal is to characterize the technical mechanisms, grasp value implications, and understand users&apos; perceptions of these systems. Based on this study, the investigators will develop a conceptual model that represents the interaction among technical characteristics, values supported by (or embodied in) the system, and users&apos; perceptions of their interactive experience with it. This model will guide the next phase of the project: to design and implement a prototype for a security configuration that is explicitly responsive to values and users&apos; perceptions. User studies and further philosophical analysis of the prototype will help to refine the security configuration and, ultimately, to refine and assess the model itself. Through industry contacts and other traditional methods, the investigators will disseminate the results of their study, including the conceptual model, prototype, and aspects of the multidisciplinary methodology they develop.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">ABSTRACT: CMU, Bonnie John, PI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CISE Educational Innovation award provides funds to support the design, implementation, evaluation and dissemination of a new introductory-level course in computing which teaches the Strategic Use of Computer Systems. This strategic knowledge has been developed under a 1994 NSF Young Investigator Award to the PI. It helps users decompose tasks effectively and efficiently with respect to the powers and limitation of their computer tools and has been shown to produce significant improvements in productivity. The new course is being developed with a pilot section of students in the Computing Skills Workshop (CSW) course at CMU beginning in 1999 and is expected to then be adopted by all of the CSW sections in the next year. The project has the potential to make major impact on undergraduate education in computing at a national level.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Two significant components of VLSI manufacturing test cost are the test length, and the reject rate. The latter is the rate at which bad devices escape detection by the test. This research explores a new approach to estimate the reject rate so that optimum balance can be struck between the test length and the reject rate. The approach includes extensions to handle multiple types of tests that are commonly employed by the manufacturers, e.g. stuck-at, IDDQ, delay, and functional. Analytical methods for estimating the reject rate are too complex to capture accurately all interactions among parameters, which leads to unreliable reject rate estimates. In this project an empirical, yet robust model is being developed. It is based on properties observed in tester data that are demonstrated to be invariant for a wide range of manufacturing technologies and types of tests.</data>

The project will be a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional collaboration. The first goal of the research is to achieve overlap in shear rate between experiments and simulations with the same systems. This overlap, sought for over a decade, will be achieved through significant advances in the capabilities of both the experimental and numerical approaches. A second goal is to extend both the experimental and computational efforts to more complicated systems and surface characteristics, including surfaces with chemical and topographical heterogeneity, that are of primary technological importance. A third goal is to study not only the steady-state shear response of nano-tribology systems but also their transient behavior, including the technologically important issues related to adhesion. A final, but overarching, goal of the work is to seek new methods to reduce the friction and wear of moving surfaces separated by only nanometers. These goals will be attained through coordinated experiments and calculations that probe the fundamental phenomena involved at a molecular level. The motivation for this work is that devices with moving parts separated by only nanometers are already of immense technological and economic importance, magnetic recording devices such as computer disk drives, for example. Many other novel micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), such as micro-motors, are under development. The fluid between the moving surfaces in such devices is subjected to extremely high rates of shear strain, 108 s-1 or higher, more than an order of magnitude higher than previously attained in any controlled experiment. Often, lubrication is essential to the practical use of such devices, and the US data storage industry has identified the development of new lubricants and surf ace finish as one of six major technical objectives to achieving increased recording density and read/write speed.

      <data key="e_abstract">ABSTRACT NCR-9730162 Eric Friedman Rutgers University with a subcontract to Scott Shenker Xerox PARC Learning and the Design of the Internet This project will study some foundational issues in the application of game theoretic ideas to the design of the Internet and other decentralized networks. Many researchers apply game theoretic ideas to the analysis of the modern Internet and in particular assume that Nash equilibria will arise in this setting. Based on recent theoretical analyses and simulations, the PIs on this project have found that convergence to Nash equilibrium is not guaranteed in Internet-like environments, due to limited information, noise, and asynchrony. This calls into question the application of the Nash Implementation&quot; on the Internet and makes the design of mechanisms, which are robust to learning by adaptive agents, much more problematic. The goal of this project is to understand precisely what kinds of mechanisms are learnable on the Internet and use this to design protocols and price mechanisms that implement socially desirable outcomes under this constraint. For example, preliminary results show that the FIFO queuing protocol is not learnable while fair queuing can be learned quite easily by adaptive agents. In particular, the PIs previous work has begun to identify the set of outcomes that are attained by adaptive learners. This set contains the Stackelberg undominated actions and is contained within the serially unoverwhelmed set. Several important mechanisms work in these settings, e.g. fair queuing, the uniform mechanism, fixed path methods, and also many problems with enough players and capacity, in addition the PIs have just begun to analyze the general implications of these results for general design problems. For example only strictly coallitionally strategy-proof social choice functions are implementable on the Internet. However, there still remain many open questions, which this project will attempt to resolve. This project also has i mplications for Economics and Game Theory. Besides the Internet, there are many decentralized systems in Economics for which we believe these results are applicable. In particular, oligopolists, joint producers, and polluters operate asynchronously with limited observability and often with little knowledge of the underlying payoff matrix. This project should increase our understanding in these settings. This project will utilize three complementary methodologies: i) A continuing theoretical and analytical study of these issues ii) this will be complemented with computer simulations, and iiii) experiments with human subjects who will be studied under settings designed to mimic the scenarios faced by actual users on the Internet. The interplay of these three approaches should help create a robust and realistic theory for designing learnable mechanisms for the Internet.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Combinatorial Optimization and Integer Programming: Polyhedral Analysis and Algorithms</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9802773 Balas The research funded by this grant addresses some basic theoretical and methodological aspects of integer and combinatorial optimization. Over the last few years the principal investigators have developed a technique called lift-and-project for solving mixed integer programs. When embedded in an enumerative framework, called branch-and-cut, this approach has shown itself to be highly robust and competitive with the best available alternatives. A major goal of the research is to consolidate these results and develop the approach in new directions, by solving several open problems concerning the properties of the cutting planes used; the way of generating and handling them; and, the interplay between cutting and branching. Part of this research will combine polyhedral methods with some tools borrowed from artificial intelligence. A closely related research topic is focussed on a heuristic procedure called OCTANE, which uses a neighborhood search defined by a construction based on polarity. Another topic involves ideal 0-1 matrices, which make certain integer programs defined by them solvable as linear programs. Finally, a substantial part of the research will focus on the traveling salesman problem, and some of its generalizations, focusing on a dynamic programming approach that can efficiently solve large classes of problems in this area. The research envisaged here is expected to substantially enhance the state of the art in solving integer and combinatorial optimization problems in general, traveling salesman-type problems in particular. Some of the investigations are aimed at gaining new theoretical insights and a deeper understanding of the structures involved, but most of the research is methodological in nature and is therefore expected to result in more efficient algorithms and computer codes. The problems to which such algorithms may be applicable range from investment decisions, capacity expansion models, location and distribution problems, to industrial scheduling and sequencing.</data>

      <data key="e_title">The Capabilities and Limitations of Atomated Discovery</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The models used in inductive inference have their roots in the models used by the philosophers of science who were discussing the scientific method. The goal there, and in prior work in learning theory, was to come up with an explanation of the phenomenon under consideration. However, scientists rarely work directly for the grand goal of a complete explanation, seeking rather the more modest goal of finding features and facts about the observed data. In like manner, this project pursues several modifications to the traditional models used in inductive inference so as to study the pursuit of more modest scientific goals. This study is particularly relevant to contemporary science as automated data generation techniques produce sufficient volumes of data to overwhelm the analysis abilities of humans. The goal of our work is to illuminate precisely what can and cannot be accomplished by automatic data analysis algorithms.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This research is to develop a high level, semi-automated process for validating models. The approach is based on the principle of modeling the environment surrounding the system that the model represents. There are four objectives: 1) developing initial sensor models with high-level graphics- based tools that allow one to concentrate on the system mathematics to insure sensor model correctness, 2) refining sensor models over time into a library structure, 3) exploring automated mechanisms for requirements capture and processing and linking the model validation system to specification requirements, and 4) creating a goal tree based test planning system to guide the selection of and development of model tests. Validation of VHDL models of DSP algorithms is being done under this research.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The objective of this program is to design an efficient VLSI implementation for certain algebraic geometry codes, to fabricate a chip, and to identify applications where these codes would be competitive. The codes to be considered are Hermitian codes and other codes similar in structure. The advantage of these codes is that, for a given symbol size, they are longer than Reed- Solomon codes and can therefore take better advantage of the law of large numbers to give much greater error correction capability. A number of decoding algorithms for these codes exist, including those developed by the co-PIs. We will combine the best elements of these algorithms into an explicit computational algorithm that is well suited to VLSI implementation. The goal is to produce a chip that uses parallel processing, regular and simple structures, simple logic, and a minimal number of iterations. We will verify the logic design using a VHDL simulation. We will also identify systems where these codes would be appropriate and test the performance of the decoder in channel simulations appropriate to those applications.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Abstract - Miller CTS - 9729578 A numerical model for a flickering, or time-varying, flame is developed; this model is intended to accurately and efficiently predict emission levels for nitrogen oxides. The model consists of three sections: (1) prediction of flame structure through solution of conservation equations in mass, momentum, energy, and mixture fraction; (2) application of a flamelet library approach to predict concentrations of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen species; and (3) post-processing nitrogen chemistry to predict local levels and emissions of nitrogen oxide species. The unsteady flame structure is predicted using an adaptive spectral element discretization of the conservation equations on both serial and parallel machines. The existing incompressible spectral element code is revised to permit variable density. At each step in the process, model predictions are compared with measurements of concentration from tunable-diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) on a methane-fueled flame, including in situ measurements of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane and conditional sampling of the flame using a pulsed quartz microprobe to determine concentrations of trace nitrogen species including nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia, and hydrogen cyanide. This effort introduces a new computational approach for the modelling of pollutant formation and flame behavior.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Code Generation for ILP Architectures with Partitioned Register Banks</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Current microprocessor design directions are towards chips that provide greater instruction-level parallelism (ILP). Unfortunately, large amounts of ILP hardware and aggressive instruction scheduling techniques put large demands on a machine&apos;s register resources. With large levels of ILP, it is difficult to maintain a single register bank. The number of ports required for such a register bank severely hampers access time and may require too much chip space. As a result,partitioned register banks with limited connectivity are needed forhigh ILP architectures. The use of partitioned register banks,however, inhibits ILP when data is fetched from another register bank. This research addresses methods to reduce the overhead associated with partitioned register banks in a machine-independent fashion. Specifically, the research addresses the following issues 1. A machine-independent program representation modeling communication and parallelism. 2. New algorithms to partition data amongst a machine&apos;s register banks. 3. Loop transformations that expose the data parallelism at the instruction level. 4. Clustering schemes that allow a group of functional units to access a single register bank. As a result of this research, higher levels of ILP will be more attractive due to a lower overhead associated with partitioned register banks.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project aims to develop a new visual exploration paradigm emphasizing integrated data/metadata analysis and to use it to enhance the capabilities of the DEVise (Data Exploration and VISualization Environment) tool. From a research standpoint, several issues require attention in developing such tools, including optimization and evaluation techniques to support scalability for large datasets, integrated presentation of data and metadata, combination of database-style querying and visualization, and support for collaborative analysis. This is expected to lead to significantly improved interactive visual interfaces to large, distributed databases, with potential applications in a wide variety of commercial and scientific domains. The results will be published in articles, and embodied in a prototype tool that will be freely distributed in binary form. http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~devise</data>

Image understanding relates to the representation and analysis of knowledge about complex physical systems. Recent advances in computer technology have enabled researchers to study massive databases using sophisticated mathematical models which are more realistic for real life applications. Due to continuous advances in sensing technology, the databases to be analyzed and understood are massive, up to several hundred megabytes for a typical application. In addition to computational power, visualization and database storage, there is also need for high speed networking among distant collaborators and distributed tasking of processing power. To handle these computer requirements, it is proposed to enhance existing resources by adding the following equipment: a high-performance Silicon Graphics Onyx2 workstation as a central server for database handling and major computing operations, two Silicon Graphics Octane workstations, two O2 workstations and accessories such as a laser printer, a VCR/monitor head, and a personal computer.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Numerical Methods for III-Posed Problems and Large Scale Eigenvalue Programs</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This work concerns two topics in numerical linear algebra: 1) Regularization of ill-posed linear systems; 2) Solution of large, sparse eigenvalue problems. These topics share common features: a wide range of application problems; the use of iterative methods for large-scale problems; and interesting problems in matrix perturbation theory. When continuous ill-posed problems are discretized they result in ill-conditioned linear systems which must be regularized to yield accurate solutions. This part of the work has several goals. The first is to prove the folk theorem that if the components of the data vector with respect to the singular vectors of the matrix decay sufficiently fast then the conjugate gradient iteration will produce a regularizing set of solution vectors. The second is to compare the numerous formulations of discrete ill-posed problems to see which are most effective. The third is to further develop preconditioners to speed convergence of solution algorithms. The fourth is to improve data-gathering techniques so that the attainable accuracy from imaging is better, thus, for example, revealing smaller tumors or more information about distant stars. Over the past decade many new algorithms for finding clusters of eigenvalues of large matrices have been proposed. Although the effectiveness of some of these algorithms has been demonstrated empirically, analytic results are sparse. Fortunately, a large number of these methods share a common framework, so that it is possible to develop analytic tools that are widely applicable. As a start toward this goal, attention is focused on a new, promising method---singular vector enhancement---that fits in the framework. A preliminary analysis of a special case has already yielded valuable results on the relation of eigenvalues and singular values. The results of this project will impact the solution of ill-posed problems such as medical image enhancement, astronomical data processing, nondestructive testing, and spectroscopy, as well as eigenvalue problems arising in systems modeling (Markov chains), computational chemistry, and structural analysis.</data>

      <data key="e_title">ScalaServer: System Support for Scalable Network Servers</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project develops a novel architecture for the construction of scalable Internet servers from commodity hardware and modular application software components. The architecture targets network servers based on clusters of workstations or PCs, and allows servers to fully realize the performance potential of this platform. Off-the-shelf server applications are executing on the server nodes in a modular fashion and are unaware of the existence of multiple server nodes. As a result, ScalaServer leverages both existing server applications and the price/performance curve of commodity hardware. The design of the ScalaServer architecture will be based on the results of extensive tracedriven simulations. Prototype systems for both single-node and cluster servers will be disseminated to the research community. It is expected that the project will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in highperformance, scalable, and cost-effective network server design and implementation, an area that is critical to the future global information infrastructure. The project will also contribute to the education of scientists and engineers in this important area, both at the graduate and undergraduate level.***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9810098 Simon The objective of this research is to extend porohyperelastic transport swelling (PHETS) field theories developed by the investigators for the coupled structural and transport properties of large arteries. New finite element models based on the extended theories will be implemented and used to analyze the results of experiments on the transport of charged and neutral species in excised rabbit carotid arteries under various loading conditions. With PHETS material parameters for nonlinear anisotropic tissue elasticity, permeability, diffusivity, mechano-chemical coupling, and convection thus identified from the analysis of the experimental studies, the new models will be able to predict the results of in-vivo conditions that can not readily be performed experimentally and to characterize the action of intravascular local drug delivery systems. Experimental studies in de-endothelialized rabbit carotid arteries will examine the transport of fluorescence-labeled charged and neutral species under pressure loading alone as well as combined pressure and flow conditions. ***</data>

      <data key="e_title">Parametric Design of Embedded Real-Time Systems</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this research is to develop scalable, automated methods to design high-performance embedded systems - particularly those with real-time latency and throughput requirements. In such systems, computations flow through heterogeneous interacting components, which are managed by local resource-schedulers and drivers. Hence, a key design problem is that of balancing and tuning the local resource-managers, so that they collaboratively meet the global end-to-end performance objectives. The proposed approach involves parametrically transforming the end-to-end constraints into local (per-component) constraints, and then solving them for optimal on-line performance. Specifically, the method works by (1) extracting performance models for key stages along the all data paths; (2) hierarchically grouping the per- component models into larger system-level prototypes; and (3) using the system-level models to help calibrate the local resource management policies. Step (3) is called &quot;design synthesis.&quot; To carry it out, the proposed method relies on off-line algorithms to synthesize optimal CPU/IO bandwidth allocations for all pipeline stages. After synthesis, the analytic estimates are checked via simulation. Then the system is integrated, and rechecked via on- line benchmarking. Two reference applications are proposed to validate this framework: (1) A software realization of a large- scale radar signal processor, to be run on several workstation- clusters; and (2) a video server system connected via 100Mbs partitioned Ethernet.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">It is believed that there are two major challenges in the overall success of multi-threaded architectures: (1) Building multi-threaded systems with off-the-shelf components and, (2) Providing effective programming language and compiler support for common imperative languages (like C and Fortran). At the University of Delaware Gao&apos;s research group has successfully built a multi-threaded machine from off-the-shelf components. The remaining challenge is to demonstrate successful use of imperative languages for such architectures. This project proposes to investigate whether aggressive interprocedural analysis and transformations, combined with accurate alias analysis, can be applied to irregular applications coded in imperative languages for compilation and efficient execution on multi-threaded systems. Novel analysis, transformation and code generation techniques are being developed to examine the strengths (and weaknesses) of using imperative languages for multi-threaded systems. The major challenge in generating code is partitioning the sequential code into strands, such that the code for each strand can be executed without requiring any remote memory references. Before strand partitioning, interprocedural code motion and loop transformations will be used to reduce the frequency of off-processor references and enable better strand partitioning. Developing new analyses for these transformations, which take into account the possibility of aliasing and the cost functions for multi-threaded architectures is one of the main focus of this project.

      <data key="e_title">Long-range Dependence and Heavy Tails in Communication Networks</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">There has been recently a big increase in the number of studies related to the statistical analysis and mathematical modeling of traffic measurements from modern communication networks. While many of the measured traffic traces differ from each other in their high-frequency behavior, they typically exhibit a number of statistical characteristics that tend to be insensitive to the constant changes that real-life data networks experience over time. Such robust characteristics are sometimes called &quot;traffic invariants&quot;, and include such phenomena as long-range dependence and/or heavy tails. Long-range dependence occurs when the correlations of the traffic processes at hand decay to zero slowly as the lag increases (i.e., power-law decay) and causes traffic to exhibit pronounced larger-than average ``bursts&apos;&apos; and lower-than-average ``lulls&apos;&apos;. Heavy tails refer to the power-law decay of the underlying probability distributions and capture the notions of extreme variability and ``intermittancy&apos;&apos;. In the networking context, long-range dependence and heavy tails abound and have been observed at practically all layers in the networking hierarchy. This research focuses on these traffic invariants: how to detect and measure them, how to explain their presence in realistic networking situations, what is their effect on queuing/loss performance, and also how to identify other potential invariants, especially within the apparent chaotic structure in the high-frequency domain. One of the open problems in understanding the dynamic nature of network traffic is when the underlying traffic (e.g., packet rate process), in addition to exhibiting strong temporal dependencies, is itself non-Gaussian and exhibits heavy tails. This research aims to develop physical models that can explain the joint presence of long-range dependence and heavy tails at the macroscopic level. These models should be useful in practice, give rise to efficient traffic generation methods that result in synthetic traces with realistic features, and provide novel insights into the wide area of network performance analysis. Another problem area concerns the nature of network traffic at the microscopic level, where we will build upon the recent discovery of the presence of multiplicative mechanisms that cause network traffic over fine time scales to exhibit multifractal scaling properties. This research also focuses on the Web and plans to track how self-similarity, heavy-tails, and multifractals fare in a constantly changing Internet. How does the ever increasing variability in access speeds (e.g., traditional modems on one hand, cable modems, 100 Mbps Ethernet on the other) and the more and more heterogeneous nature of access technologies (e.g., phone modems, cable modems, ADSL) will affect the nature of currently considered workload models and how they will impact the scaling (i.e., self-similarity) properties of aggregate packet traffic. This project involves the collaborative effort of the P.I. (Murad S. Taqqu) at Boston University and the Co-P.I. (Walter Willinger) at AT&amp;T-Labs Research.

      <data key="e_abstract">Computer programs to perform symbolic calculations to solve mathematical, scientific, and engineering problems have become popular and highly useful in the last decade. However, systems for symbolic computation in noncommutative algebras have not attained the generality of systems for commutative algebra. This project develops a system for symbolic computation in Hopf algebras, and supports algebras and Hopf algebras. The project relies on multidisciplinary interaction between algebraists and computer scientists. The Hopf system uses the GAP system as a foundation upon which to build more advanced functions. GAP is freely distributed over the Internet, as is the Hopf system. The Hopf system is able to support advanced research in noncommutative algebras and their applications to science, especially mathematics and physics.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">EIA-9870740 Levy, Henry M. Karlin, Anna R. University of Washington ESS: Distributed Resource Management in Local-Area and Wide-Area Networks Advances in network and processor technology are greatly changing the communication and computational power of networked computers. However, current software systems are unable to utilize the capabilities of modern hardware components, because they are designed for last-generation hardware. The goal of this research is to enable more effective use of future networks and processors through design and implementation of new software structures and algorithms better suited to the characteristics of future hardware. The research focuses on two related but independent domains. First, in local-area networks (clusters), this work seeks to improve the performance of applications through distributed, cluster-wide resource management. It will develop algorithms that permit the tight-knit sharing of all cluster-wide network resources: processors, network, memory, and disk storage. Second, this research seeks to apply experience in global resource management to a much broader domain -- the global Internet. The project will develop and test algorithms that optimally and dynamically locate both data and computation in the Internet, in order to improve data-access latencies and reduce network bandwidth utilization. A significant component of this research is the construction of a software simulation infrastructure to test hypotheses applied to such a large-scale system as the world-wide web.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">EIA-9870740 Levy, Henry M. Karlin, Anna R. University of Washington ESS: Distributed Resource Management in Local-Area and Wide-Area Networks Advances in network and processor technology are greatly changing the communication and computational power of networked computers. However, current software systems are unable to utilize the capabilities of modern hardware components, because they are designed for last-generation hardware. The goal of this research is to enable more effective use of future networks and processors through design and implementation of new software structures and algorithms better suited to the characteristics of future hardware. The research focuses on two related but independent domains. First, in local-area networks (clusters), this work seeks to improve the performance of applications through distributed, cluster-wide resource management. It will develop algorithms that permit the tight-knit sharing of all cluster-wide network resources: processors, network, memory, and disk storage. Second, this research seeks to apply experience in global resource management to a much broader domain -- the global Internet. The project will develop and test algorithms that optimally and dynamically locate both data and computation in the Internet, in order to improve data-access latencies and reduce network bandwidth utilization. A significant component of this research is the construction of a software simulation infrastructure to test hypotheses applied to such a large-scale system as the world-wide web.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Effective Compilation in the Presence of Exceptions</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Java is designed to be a mature, object-oriented programming languagemainly for Web-based programming. However, Java can support general stand-alone applications as well, such as scientific codes that consist of independent components using exceptions as a control mechanism between components. Although Java is too new to have been used extensively in applications, it is clear that user-defined exceptions will be ubiquitous in Java programs, causing them to exhibit distinctive control flow, different from previous object-oriented languages. The proposed research concentrates on combining new analysis techniques with two optimization strategies, namely speculative and non- speculative, using a testbed of scientific applications for validation. Exceptions pose new challenges to optimizing compilers since they introduce implicit control flow and their semantics requires access to user-visible state at any raised exception. Optimization strategies may either preserve exceptions and their visible states, or perform speculative optimizations by ignoring exceptions, and restore the visible state if an exception is raised. New static analyses are needed to provide an accurate estimate of control flow within and across method boundaries, including concrete type inference and subsequent def-use analyses. The resulting information is crucial for the effectiveness of many optimizations, including code specialization, code motion, register allocation, and instruction scheduling.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Realistic Computer Graphics for Natural Scenes</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project aims to improve the quality of computer graphic images of outdoor, natural scenes. To date, renderings of outdoor terrain have had a cartoon-like quality that significantly distracts from a sense of realism. Partially, this is due to computational and source data constraints that limit the geometric complexity of terrain that can be rendered. The thesis of the research described here is that illumination and material properties play an equally important role in creating a sense of realism from these scenes. Moreover, there are important interactions between geometry, illumination, and material properties in a model of outdoor terrain that should be understood when real-time constraints must also be satisfied. Significant progress has been made in the last decade in understanding how to generate realistic renderings of indoor scenes. The general approach is to analyze the physics of light transport in such environments and then to embody approximations to the physics in computational algorithms. Correct modeling of illumination and material properties is vital. It is now known that a sense of realism depends critically on accounting for shadows, secondary illumination, and non-uniform reflectance functions. Accurately approximating the effect of these properties involves great computational expense. As a result, methods for rendering realistic imagery almost always exploit assumptions about the nature of the geometric structure and illumination and materials properties likely to be encountered. Most of these assumptions derive from a presumption of indoor environments. Outdoor scenes present very different computational characteristics. While the physics is the same, geometry, illumination, and reflectance properties are all distinctly different. Many of the techniques developed to support realistic rendering of indoor scenes will require substantial modifications for natural, outdoor environments. The most difficult computational prob lem to overcome is the need to be able to aggregate the effects of micro-structures into large enough units that they can be rendered effectively, while at the same time preserving key aspects of visual appearance. This problem exists across a wide range of scales, ranging from foliage, in which a collection of individual leaves generates a collective appearance that is quite different than that of the constituent members, to distant landmarks, where detail must be suppressed without removing those properties that make landmarks distinctive and thus useful.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">----------------------------------------------------------------------- Proposal Number: DMS 9803226 PI: Werner Stuetzle, Brian Curless, Tom Duchamp Institution: University of Washington Project: 3D Scanning: Acquiring and Modeling Surface Properties Abstract: 3D scanning is the inverse of computer aided manufacturing: given a physical object, such as a clay model of a car, a sculpture, a chair, or a house, create an electronic representation capturing its shape and appearance. 3D scanning is similar in principle to a number of other important technologies (like digital audio, digital photography, document scanning, and digital video) that quickly, accurately, and cheaply record useful aspects of physical reality. These technologies have had an enormous impact, primarily because electronic representations can be used in ways the original physical objects cannot. For example, they can be stored in, searched for, and retrieved from databases, transmitted electronically over long distances, manipulated and edited in software, and used as templates for making electronic or physical copies. Research in 3D scanning promises to have a similar impact on a number of areas, including the Federal Strategic Areas of high performance communication, civil infrastructure, and manufacturing, as well as virtual museums, entertainment, and product marketing. This research group and others have made significant progress in capturing, modeling, and displaying geometric shape. The task of acquiring and computing surface properties such as appearance, however, has received far less attention. The research effort in this project focuses on three aspects of the problem: (i) texturing, bump mapping and selective refinement of multiresolution meshes, (ii) capturing, modeling and displaying radiance (color as a function of position and direction), and (iii) generally estimating functions over surfaces.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Logic-Based Approaches to Learning and Knowledge Discovery</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Logic forms a basic framework for artificial intelligence, including machine learning and knowledge discovery in databases. Predicate logic, which is used by several machine learning systems, poses both open problems of learning complexity and questions that do not arise in other approaches to learning. There are algorithmic approaches to knowledge discovery in databases that suggest several open problems for propositional and predicate logic, and complexity theory. Some of the learnability issues specific to predicate logic that will be studied are the role of background knowledge, the efficiency of the algorithmic techniques of logic learning, such as least general generalizations, the complexity of learning multiple predicates, and types of noise that either are specific to predicate logic, or appear to behave differently for predicate logic. The first two issues will be studied using the producthomomorphism method. This technique, introduced by one of the PI&apos;s and developed further by both PI&apos;s, enables the use of combinatorial tools in constructing learning algorithms. One extension to be studied is learning certain broader classes of logic programs, which are useful for practical applications. The complexity of the general product-homomorphism problem will also be investigated. In the area of noise-tolerance, one topic to be studied is the complexity of learning Boolean conjunctions in noise models that are more difficult for the learner than random classification noise. This could lead to extensions of previous work of the PI&apos;s on learning noisy logic programs. Expanding the scope of learning problems studied in learning theory, the project will construct algorithms for relations definable in a finite model by restricted classes of formulas, such as formulas with a bounded number of variables. This continues the model theoretic approach to learning, studied earlier by one of the PI&apos;s. Another, related family of problems involves classes of atomic f ormulas satisfying first-order constraints. In knowledge discovery in databases, a logic- based approach is to find the theory of the database, which means identifying all interesting statements that hold in the database, using an appropriate notion of interesting statement. Algorithmically, this requires polynomial-delay listing algorithms for different classes of objects, such as the maximal frequent sets of a 0-1 matrix. The project will study the possibilities of gaining efficiency by taking into account the structure of the database. This leads to questions about restricted classes of threshold circuits, and generalized versions of the minimal hitting set listing problem. The methods to be used are primarily combinatorial, such as products and homomorphisms of graphs, and model- theoretic games. This project will contribute to the understanding of the limits of efficient learnability in predicate logic. It will also develop new algorithms that may be useful for practical machinelearning systems, and contribute to the methodology for tolerating noisy data. The overall goal of this work is to gain a better understanding of the computational complexity aspects of learning using logic.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Over the last two decades there has been an explosive growth in online data storage of various forms. These large datasets have motivated the rapid development of data mining methods. However, until now, there has been a lack of an online repository of large data sets for researchers to evaluate and compare their methods. In this project, an online repository of large and difficult data sets are being gathered that are representative of the diverse character of many important scientific and business domains. This repository includes high-dimensional data sets as well as data sets of different data types (time series, spatial data, transaction data, and so forth). The primary role of the repository is that of a benchmark testbed to enable researchers in data mining (including computer scientists, statisticians, engineers, and mathematicians) to scale existing and future data analysis algorithms to very large data sets. Each data set in the respository contains online documentation, metadata, and links to relevant background domain information such as prior published work. Availability of a standard set of large benchmark data sets will directly stimulate and foster systematic progress in data mining related research, similar to the affect that the UCI Machine Learning Data Repository has had on machine learning research. This repository will play a substantial role in brokering the gap between research-oriented algorithm development in the laboratory and the real-world practicalities and challenges of very large data sets. http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html</data>

These arise in a number of application contexts, including manufacturing, graph drawing, robotics, and graphics. The project&apos;s concentrations touch on all these application areas. Research on shortest paths and geodesics on polytopes is relevant to robotics and to texture mapping in graphics. Folding and unfolding of research is connected to a variety of manufacturing concerns. And visibility algorithms see use in graphics and graph drawing. A collection of fundamental open problems in these areas will be pursued, both theoretically and through experimentation with code. Progress on geodesics, on folding, on floodlight illumination, and on visibility graphs can be expected. Female undergraduate students will be engaged in all aspects of the research, and all software developed will be freely distributed on the Internet.</data>

Park, Kihong Purdue University ESS: ISAC: Integrated System Support for Adaptive Communication and Computation Control in Clustered Environments This project aims to build an integrated software system (ISAC) for application development in cluster-computing environments. ISAC addresses issues of communication control and load balancing to facilitate an effective parallel platform. In contrast to traditional approaches, ISAC views communication and computation control in an integrated system. It dynamically schedules computation and communication making use of their repetitive nature to achieve optimal performance. End-to-end congestion control is augmented by a group communication mechanism that conjointly schedules communication and computation. Scheduling is carried out assuming a best-effort network environment in which resources are shared among a pool of applications. Communication control is adaptive, and scheduling is performed dynamically as a function of network state. Assuming that routers implement a form of weighted fair queuing wherein resource reservations can be affected, ISAC implements guaranteed-bandwidth channels either per-connection or per-multicast group using a form of admission control. In conjunction with process scheduling support at host stations, this allows critical applications to achieve guaranteed progress impervious to network and processor loads. It also allows applications to deal with heterogeneity among hosts and networking environments transparently. ISAC will significantly enhance the programmability and performance of cluster-computing applications ranging from scientific computing to distributed web and database servers.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">EIA-9806741 Grama, Ananth Y. Park, Kihong Purdue University ESS: ISAC: Integrated System Support for Adaptive Communication and Computation Control in Clustered Environments This project aims to build an integrated software system (ISAC) for application development in cluster-computing environments. ISAC addresses issues of communication control and load balancing to facilitate an effective parallel platform. In contrast to traditional approaches, ISAC views communication and computation control in an integrated system. It dynamically schedules computation and communication making use of their repetitive nature to achieve optimal performance. End-to-end congestion control is augmented by a group communication mechanism that conjointly schedules communication and computation. Scheduling is carried out assuming a best-effort network environment in which resources are shared among a pool of applications. Communication control is adaptive, and scheduling is performed dynamically as a function of network state. Assuming that routers implement a form of weighted fair queuing wherein resource reservations can be affected, ISAC implements guaranteed-bandwidth channels either per-connection or per-multicast group using a form of admission control. In conjunction with process scheduling support at host stations, this allows critical applications to achieve guaranteed progress impervious to network and processor loads. It also allows applications to deal with heterogeneity among hosts and networking environments transparently. ISAC will significantly enhance the programmability and performance of cluster-computing applications ranging from scientific computing to distributed web and database servers.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">EIA-9806718 Mairson, Harry G. Bawden, Alan Brandeis University ESS: Linear Naming: Experimental Software for Optimizing Communication Protocols The goal of our research project is to design and implement significantly new forms of procedure calling protocols for local and distributed communication. This project combines development of applications technology with foundational research on programming language design. The research focuses on the implementation of a new procedure-calling protocol that incorporates the desirable semantics of call-by-value with the efficiency of call-by-name. The implementation depends on the technology of sharing values as well as the sharing of computation threads. Closely linked is the development of language primitives for handling values and control structures in a symmetric manner. The pragmatics of sharing is intimately connected to the crucial role of &quot;linear naming&quot; in distributed network computation, especially when named computations are mobile. Procedure-calling protocols and their interaction with naming form the glue that holds complex computations together. In a distributed environment, parts of an evolving computation can become separated from each other. A fundamental problem is bringing these parts back together again when the appropriate time arrives---this is what naming is for. Proper attention to linearity in naming can make cross-network references cheap, can support highly mobile data structures, and can facilitate heuristics to effectively migrate tasks on demand without explicit guidance.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The project proposes research on distributed systems that monitor the positions of various moving objects and process queries and triggers referring to their positions. Applications of such systems, called Moving Object Information (MOI) applications, typically occur in transportation systems in the civilian sector and in the digital battlefield management in the military. This proposal considers two different architecture models for the MOI systems; in the first one a single central server (CS) monitors the position of the objects and answers queries; the second architecture is fully distributed in which the moving objects communicate with each other to answer the queries and to monitor trigger conditions. The project proposes various location update policies for maintenance of the position information of the objects in the CS model. All these policies maintain the position of an object as a dynamic attribute that changes with time. The project plans to investigate the cost effectiveness of these policies through analytical and experimental studies. A query language based on Future Temporal Logic (FTL) is proposed for specifying spatial and temporal queries and trigger conditions on the moving objects. The language permits specification of the desired levels of uncertainties in the answer. Research towards the development of efficient query/trigger processing mechanisms in the two architectures are proposed. The proposed mechanisms will be evaluated in an experimental testbed.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Modern telecommunication systems demand high performance circuit components that can operate at billions of cycles per second. Such components must also work in extreme environment such as high and low temperature. For example, components in a cellular phone must operate properly whether it is used in Texas during the summer or in Alaska during the winter. Furthermore, these components must be economically competitive. These strict technical and economical challenges call for new approaches at the component level. The recent advances in fabrication of minute mechanical devices may make possible the implementation of high-frequency components that can address the aforementioned challenges. This research involves the design of micromachined electro-mechanically tunable capacitors for RFIC applications in the 1-2 GHz range. The investigators are examining the effects of various physical phenomena such as gravity, shock, ware, and temperature on tunable capacitor characteristics. The researchers are also studying the feasibility of RF voltage controlled oscillators and electronically tunable filters based on these micromachined devices. RF switches are also being investigated. A prototype two-plate micromachined varactor is being fabricated in MUMPS polysilicon surface micromachining technology and has a nominal capacitance of 2 pF, a tuning range of 1.5:1, a maximum control voltage of 4 Volts, and a Q-factor of 20 at 1 GHz. The first prototype voltage controlled oscillator based on such micromachined tunable capacitor oscillates at 1.35 GHz, has a tuning range of 2 percent, and has a phase noise of -98.5 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset from the carrier.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Stochastic and population-based search methods (simulated annealing, metropolis, WalkSAT, genetic algorithms) have been successful as optimization heuristics in a number of application areas. However, very little is known about which problems they succeed at, which instances they do well on, or how to make implementation choices to tailor the method to a given application. To address this, recent theoretical work on population-based methods will be used as a guide in an experimental study of the structure of search spaces. Population- based algorithms (in particular go-with-the-winners local optimization, will be used to sample uniformly from the part of the search space that meets a certain minimal standard of optimality. Such samples will be used to discover combinatorial characteristics of search spaces, and then to predict and improve the performance of optimization heuristics. Social Impact: There will be collaboration between theorists and experimenters. This will help forget ties between the two research communities. Graduate students will learn to balance theoretical skills, programming institution, and concern for applications</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project is investigating computer architectures based on a distributed, decentralized (DD) approach to computing. It is now necessary to re-examine traditional concepts of processor architecture because the gap between processor cycle time and relative memory access time is increasing, distributing a high-speed synchronous clock to billions of transistors is difficult, and as processors become more complex and compiler analysis becomes more intelligent, their interface must be improved. In this research, the underlying processor model used is both distributed and decentralized in resource allocation, consisting of multiple independently programmable processing elements, elasticity connected to one another and to memory via FIFO queues. This approach is capable of tolerating memory latency, overcoming the clock distribution problem, and facilitating the transfer of compiler information to the hardware. This project includes the development of compiler technology and a hierarchical simulation framework to demonstrate these claims.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Tiling is a well-known optimization technique that has been used to obtain orders of magnitude performance improvements on certain types of computer programs -- ones with nicely structured loops and regular memory accesses. This research will extend tiling and related optimization techniques to a larger class of programs. The methods employed to carry out these goals are: (1) Collect a corpus of scientific applications, including unstructured programs and programs with irregular memory accesses. (2) Build a high- level analysis tool to study this corpus and to provide information that can be used to guide program transformations. (3) Develop more powerful transformations to extend tiling to this corpus. These transformations will be embodied in a source-to- source program restructurer. (4) Build an architecturally-driven guidance system to guide the choice of transformations. This system will model the multitiered parallelism and memory hierarchies of modern computers. (5) Evaluate the new transformations compared to hand-optimized versions of the applications. The projected impact of the work is the development of compiler technology that will automatically improve the performance of a broad class of computer programs for scientific applications.</data>

The focus application is joint space-time adaptive processing for DS/CDMA communications systems with antenna arrays. The objective is the development of fast, low complexity optimization procedures that exhibit superior disturbance (multiple-access- interference and channel noise) suppression characteristics in small data support situations. The low optimization complexity objective implies that matrix inversion and/or eigen decomposition operations are highly undesirable. In this context, the core subject of this investigation is the development and analysis of inductive, conditional optimization procedures in the form of a sequence of weighted auxiliary vectors that are orthonormal to each other and to the joint space-time vector direction of interest.</data>

The requested equipment consists of a high performance computer server, a high performance 3D graphics server, a high performance image/video/geometry server, peripheral devices such as a 3D digitizer, and a technical staff member to manage the equipment. The investigators will be working in the areas of capture, involving the automatic acquisition of 3D urban scenes and computational video techniques for organizing and interacting with video objects; in exploration, including research in immersive image-based virtual environments, hybrid geometry and imaged-based representations, and hardware for accelerated walk-throughs; and in design and simulation, with research in computer-aided lighting and acoustic modeling, interactive high-fidelity rendering, weathering and surface appearance, and photomontage. A broad spectrum of application domains will benefit from this work, including construction and renovation, visual impact studies, crisis management, and training tools in applications, such as manufacturing processes and vehicle operation.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Performance Analysis of Wavelength Routed Wide Area Networks</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Wavelength routed wide area networks will be an integral part of the future of all-optical network infrastructures. It is envisioned that these networks will act as the backbone that provides the interconnection for local area lightwave sub-networks attached to them. A significant amount of research effort has been devoted to the design and evaluation of wavelength routed architectures in recent years. However, the deployment of an infrastructure that will enable large scale interconnection of optical networks raises a number of fundamental and challenging problems that require novel and innovative solutions. The research plan outlined in this proposal identifies a number of significant but open problems arising in wavelength routed environments, and presents a comprehensive and novel approach to address them. The outcome of the proposed research will be an analytical framework that will permit the researchers to efficiently compute call blocking probabilities in wavelength routed networks, evaluate wavelength assignment policies and converter placement strategies, investigate routing algorithms for arbitrary network topologies, and study the performance of multicast calls. One of the main objectives of the work is to identify potential fairness problems that may arise in such an environment, and to employ a combination of routing , converter placement, and wavelength assignment strategies to alleviate these problems and ensure fair treatment for all calls.</data>

      <data key="e_title">SGER: High-Level Requirements</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Failure in requirements analysis is increasingly seen as a key problem in system design. Low-level requirements arising out of established and stable organizational workflow patterns are relatively easy to comprehend, but it is harder to determine high-level requirements arising from the broader institutional and organizational contexts of workflow that determine what ultimately can and cannot be accomplished with computer-based information systems. Environments with broad degrees of freedom for organizational action, especially when systems are intended to change organizational behavior present designers with the need to reduce the search space to viable options. The process for determining high-level requirements through a strategy of search-space definition and reduction is developed using an enhanced version of the Grossman, Hart and Moore property rights model to create an a priori alignment model of task responsibilities and asset ownership in a complex production system dependent on non-integrated coordination mechanisms such as contracts. This is used to determine a limited but realistic set of workflow parameters that frame the requirements analysis task. The test domain is the development of information system support for process coordination in advanced logistics, but the results of the work will be generalizable to a wider range of organizational problems. http://www.ics.uci.edu/~king/hlr.html</data>

      <data key="e_title">CONTROL for Data-Intensive Processing</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Despite significant advances in data processing over the years, many data-intensive applications still run in batch mode: they require a long period of time to execute, and during that time they provide neither feedback nor control to the user. This state of affairs holds in a number of important domains, from the desktop (e.g., spreadsheets) to the back office (e.g., decision support) to new high-end applications (e.g., data mining and visualization tools). In each of these domains, batch processing is frustrating or even unacceptable for serious users. In order to investigate large data sets, users require on-line behavior: they need to get meaningful feedback while the system runs, and they need to be able to act on the feedback by controlling the system while it runs. The goal of this research project is to explore and develop techniques to make long-running, data-intensive operations have on-line functionality. This includes new research into algorithms and systems for query processing, user interfaces, data visualization, and data mining. The results of this work should allow for a much tighter loop between users and software during the process of data analysis and data exploration. This can lead to significantly enhanced power for users, and enable significant leverage of human intelligence in the data mining process. http://control.cs.berkeley.edu</data>

This machine intimately combines eight high-performance graphics rendering pipelines with 32 conventional RISC processors. This instrument will accelerate research on real-time synthetic-environments applications in science and engineering. The principal projects set forth in this proposal are those for which both the exceptional graphics power and the intimately coupled high-performance computing power are crucial for enabling otherwise impossible research advances in the next three years. The projects include: rendering images of the world at nanometer scales as data come from atomic-force microscopes; augmented reality for applications such as giving the surgeon a view into the body using the images from inside the body, through a laparoscope; rendering massive models of complex man-made structures, such as ships and factories, for interactive walkthroughs to examine structures and make design decisions; rendering directly from multiple images of remote real-world scenes as well as from traditional geometric models; rapidly rendering to large, multi-megapixel displays either head-mounted or covering the walls; tracking outdoors for augmented reality.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of the Cornell Jaguar project is to exploit the features of Java in a database system. Java&apos;s portability and security are ideal for extensible database systems. However, several systems issues arise when a database server is integrated with a Java virtual machine. These issues are explored by extending the Predator database system with Java. The mode of research involves implementation and performance measurement. The topics explored include security for user-defined Java extensions, resource management (using the techniques developed in the Cornell J-Kernel project), scalability for highly concurrent workloads, and optimization of queries with Java extensions in a client-server environment. The results from this stage of the project provide a comprehensive understanding of how to efficiently support Java extensions in a database system. Can Java be used for traditional database server functionality? The next stage of the project addresses this question. The goal is to run queries partially at the server and partially at the client, thereby optimizing execution across slow networks. Java is an ideal choice to represent portable algorithms, and the project studies different server designs for portable query processing. However, the use of Java could reduce the overall server performance. An important result of this project is a qualitative and quantitative study of the tradeoffs between the different design choices. Research results will be disseminated through publications, and by instantiation in a full-fledged database system, Predator. The new technology developed has the potential to significantly influence the next-generation of database systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/PREDATOR ; http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jkernel/</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">EIA-9871088 Palis, Michael A. Burke, Kieron Rutgers University Camden MRI: Acquisition of a Scalable Parallel Supercomputer for the Science Vision Center This proposal requests the acquisition of a scalable parallel supercomputer that will provide the computational power to handle the scientific computing requirement of researchers at the Science Vision Center. The specific equipment requested is a Silicon Graphics Origin 2000 Scalable Parallel server with four R10000 processors, 1 gigabyte of memory, and 18 gigabytes of disk storage. This powerful system is expected to deliver at least 10-fold improvement in performance over the conventional workstations on which most of the applications are currently being run. This proposal also requests four Silicon Graphics 02 client workstations, which will be used primarily for applications development, debugging, and data visualization. Together with equipment already on hand, the parallel server and client workstations will be set up as a network, which will also serve as the testbed for the High-performance Distributed Object Programming Environment Project. The goal of this project is to design a CORBA-based parallel/distributed programming environment that will harness the combined power of the parallel server and the workstations to solve large scale parallel applications.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9807112&lt;br/&gt;Lizy K. John&lt;br/&gt;Craig M. Chase&lt;br/&gt;The University of Texas at Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental Software Systems: Performance Impact of Contemporary Programming Paradigms and Workloads&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this project is to characterize several contemporary programming paradigms, including object-oriented computing and networked computing. This study investigates why contemporary programs (developed in C++, Java, etc.) tend to run slower than traditionally developed (e.g., Fortran and C) programs. For example, when the same application is written in an object-oriented fashion and also constructed in a traditional procedural style, the object-oriented version is known to consume more memory, exhibit worse cache behavior, and to have less predictable branch behavior. This research attempts to isolate these effects and trace them to specific elements of the object oriented programming style. The principal benefit of this study is the collection of knowledge concerning how microprocessors should be designed in the future. Design decisions and engineering tradeoffs in microprocessors are often based on assumptions made about the types of programs that these processors will execute. However, detailed and accurate program characterization, such as those in this project, allows processor designers to make intelligent and informed engineering decisions.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The demand for wireless services has experienced explosive growth in recent years with no signs of abatement. Much of the remaining potential gains in wireless communications inherently require the synergy of both theoretical and experimental methods. The objective of this project is to achieve significant gains in wireless system performance and spectral efficiency through a tight, synergistic theory-experiment loop. The research objectives of the seven proposed focus areas are summarized below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wireless Testbed: An existing and functioning wireless testbed will be leveraged to build an experimental system which forms the bedrock of the proposed research. This flexible design permits operation at multiple frequencies, with multiple bandwidth and array capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiple Access Signaling: Advanced multi-user receivers will be designed by considering novel characterizations of multiple access interference, inherent parameter mismatch, and systems that offer multiple data rates. Coupled model order selection/parameter estimation techniques will be employed to optimally characterizecand mitigate interference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Space-Time Modems: Traditional models for space-time characteristics will be validated via field tests. Experimentally refined models will be used to optimize space-time codes. Both coupled and decoupled space-time processing algorithms will be developed to perform multi-user separation and channel equalization for multiple data rate systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Error Control: An interactive/iterative design process between physical layer system design and network layer protocol design will be employed to efficiently distribute system complexity. To this end, experimental error statistics will be characterized and error statistic shaping methods will be developed. For given error statistics, optimal protocols will be designed and analyzed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access Methods: Based on the error characteristics drawn from experimental data, we will design medium access control protocols to support timely establishment of message streams and to support different levels of temporal QoS in the presence of channel errors and fading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mobility: The testbed will be used to study how the channel error and fading characteristics of wireless links impact the design of a robust handoff mechanism and how error characteristics can be shaped and tuned to facilitate the design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flow Control: Flow control is an important resource management problem for reliable data transmission, especially in a high demand situation. A stable, robust, adaptive controller design scheme will be developed for a class of time-varying, time-delay system models appearing in basic flow control problems of communication networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project addresses several of the priorities established by the NSF for sponsored research programs.

      <data key="e_abstract">9873236&lt;br/&gt;Daniel Joseph &amp; Yousef Saad&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to develop parallel algorithms to treat a class of multiscale problems associated with solid particle dynamics in liquids. The focus is on full three-dimensional direct numerical simulation of the interactions of sufficiently large number of particles, thousands of particles, so that collective behavior might be inferred. This builds upon the previous research supported under the NSF-HPCC Grand Challenge Group Award where two-dimensional simulation had been successfully accomplished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The particle movers algorithm uses a combined weak formulation in which the fluid and particle equations of motion are combined into one single equation set in which the interaction forces between the particles and fluid cancel, circumventing the need for explicit calculation of forces. Extension to three-dimensions as well as increasing the number of particles in order to obtain reliable sample size, requires a major overhaul of preconditions and solvers which will define new directions for computational fluid mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multiscale phenomena addressed here are fundamental to the chemical process industry and oil exploration and recovery. Therefore, special considerations will be given to present the simulation results into forms which can be understood and used by industry. For example, collaboration with STIM-LAB a group of industrial partners in the oil and gas will be strengthened to develop a 3D design software package based on the research conducted under NSF support.</data>

This research addresses methods to analyze, organize and schedule computing in such clusters which may be connected by a fast system-area network. Research activities being carried out include: (1) Designing and developing analytical and experimental performance models and tools to quantitatively guide application users and computer architects to optimize design decisions for a given budget, and a given class of application programs. Focus is on constructing a new cluster, upgrading an existing cluster, and designing a memory hierarchy of a cluster. 2) Developing and implementing both static and dynamic scheduling schemes, as well as aiming at coordinating parallel tasks for load balancing and effectively using heterogeneous workstation resources. (3) Integrating the performance prediction models and scheduling schemes into a visualization environment.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project&apos;s goal is to study the impact of the new capabilities of high-speed networks on the design and performance of data management protocols. In particular, the focus is on high-speed wide-area networks (WANs) where the propagation latency is the dominant communication cost, the migration of large amounts of data is not an issue, and efficient multicasting and guarantees on network Quality of Service (QoS) parameters are available. In this project, existing concurrency control, commit and recovery protocols are being evaluated with respect to performance scalability under the new network assumptions. Further, new protocols are being developed that utilize the huge bandwidth and minimize the number of sequential phases of messages exploiting the multicasting capability and the provision of QoS guarantees such as bounded end-to-end packet delay and packet loss. At the same time, because of the need to scale to thousands of clients and servers, not all of which may be operational at any given time, the new WAN data management protocols are designed to achieve higher site autonomy in a cooperative manner, reducing global synchronization and supporting disconnected operations. The various protocols are empirically evaluated using computer simulation under different scenarios. The results of this research are expected to provide a better insight into the synergy between database and network technologies. This, in turn, will facilitate the deployment of future high performance WAN data server systems which are part of the necessary infrastructure that will support important nation- and world-wide applications such as electronic commerce and other web-based applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.pitt.edu/admt/projects/wands.html</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The objective of this research project is to develop the foundation for a novel assembly/disassembly method for micro/meso-scale components. The project will investigate bulk assembly/disassembly of micro- to meso-scale discrete components on a planar substrate using the combination of vibratory palletization for gross positioning and on-substrate micromechanical linear impact actuators for fine positioning and positive fastening and release. The research also aims to demonstrate the potential effectiveness of the method as a bear-chip interconnection means in multi-chip module (MCM) assembly and disassembly. Vibratory palletization will be applied to effectively eliminate the need of sequential pick-and-place style component handling/positioning. The applied high-frequency vibration is intended to overcome sticking among the components, handling devices, and substrates. The micromechanical linear impact actuators will be selectively activated also by external vibration, to provide fine positioning and positive fastening and release of the components. The integration of an array of palletizing features and linear impact actuators on a common substrate is intended to realize a bulk assembly/disassembly method suitable for micro electromechanical applications.&lt;br/&gt; Successful completion of the research will provide the enabling knowledge for bulk assembly and disassembly of micro/meso-scale components amenable for automation. The method will advance the current microelectrical and MEMS fabrication technology by dramatically increasing the number of combinable fabrication processes and materials and by improving the system reliability through increased subsystem modularity.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">EIA-9871235 Schroder, Peter Barr, Alan H. California Institute of Technology MRI: Equipment Acquisition for Research in Enabling Technologies for Volumetric Imaging, Responsive Displays and Telecollaboration This proposal pertains to equipment, which will support an integrated research program in enabling technologies for volumetric imaging, responsive displays, and telecollaboration. The PIs&apos; vision is that of an effective virtual workspace for collaborative scientific discovery and design. This requires fundamental research in the areas of geometric modeling, visualization, concurrent computation and human-computer interaction. Integrating these elements will enable us to develop new approaches for managing-and gaining insight into-complex processes and data. It will also lead to the exploration of new computing paradigms at the confluence of graphics, scientific computing, volumetric imaging, human-computer interaction, and concurrent computation. Target applications include scientific visualization, conceptual design, and rapid scientific experimentation both in synchronous and asynchronous collaboration settings. In support of this research agenda the PIs are seeking funding for the acquisition of equipment necessary to create the associated research facility. The centerpiece of the facility will be two state-of-the-art responsive workbenches, 3D stereoscopic display devices. Additionally the lab will contain a responsive whiteboard display to integrate the research into classroom settings. The support request will provide: (1) the high-performance computation and graphics hardware needed for interaction with large datasets on the responsive workbench; (2) equipment to construct a companion device, the responsive whiteboard; (3) prototype optical trackers, and (4) a fiber optic link to connect the 2 Caltech responsive workbenches.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project deals with the design of highly mobile wireless systems where not only end-users are mobile, but also the base stations that serve these end-users are mobile. The mobility of base stations introduces several challenging problems in the design and development of such systems. In this project, highly mobile wireless architectures with capability for intelligent survivability and adaptive connectivity in an unpredictable environments will be researched. Contributions will be made to the foundation of intelligent highly mobile wireless network and computing systems design, including network architecture, digital information storage, intelligent distributed adaptive reconfiguration, network routing, location management, channel allocation, and information security. Intelligent agents capable of taking autonomous decisions under uncertainty and approximate knowledge, capable of adapting to changing operating conditions (low bandwidth, changing topology and connectivity, and node failures and mobility, etc.) will be researched. An architecture and a set of relevant protocols will be designed and tested on a simulation testbed. An extensive performance evaluation and prediction will be conducted to evaluate, predict, and optimize the performance of the developed architectures, protocols, and algorithms.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this research project is to make feasible the extraction of answers to very complex queries, often called data-mining queries, from extremely large databases. Improvements along several lines are sought, including compilation of queries expressed as &quot;flocks&quot; of queries related by several parameters, extraction of relations by iterative search for patterns on the World-Wide Web, and extension of known techniques for finding associated data to detect correlations and causality in comparably large databases. The approach involves the exploration for new algorithms, their analysis, and their implementation in a series of tools for implementing user-specified queries. Anticipated applications include discovery of plausible relationships in scientific or engineering data and gathering, from large bodies of news articles or other text, useful knowledge, intelligence, and/or general rules. http://www-db.stanford.edu/midas</data>

      <data key="e_title">Explicit Constructions of Asymptotically Good Algebraic - Geometric Codes</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">One of the most exciting developments of the last two decades in the theory of error-correcting codes has been the discovery of a new class of linear codes called algebraic-geometric (AG) codes. AG codes are known to be more effective than the widely-used Reed- Solomon codes, as they offer greater flexibility in the choice of code parameters. Moreover, it has been proven that there are sequences of AG codes that exceed the Gilbert-Varshamov bound; however, the explicit construction of such AG codes has been an active research topic and is still an open problem. In this project, the following problems are explored: (1) to investigate the explicit construction of sequences of asymptotically good AG codes; and (2) to investigate these constructions to obtain asymptotically good AG codes that exceed the Gilbert-Varshamov bound for codes over GF(q^2), where q is no less than seven.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Hardware Generation of Threads in a Multithreading Processor</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Simultaneous Multithreaded (SMT) processors depend on thread- level parallelism (multiple jobs to run) to surpass the performance of single-threaded processors. However, single- thread performance is still important for mainstream processors. When there are only one or a few processes in the system, hardware can create threads that increase the ILP available to the SMT processor, using otherwise idle resources. This project is developing hardware thread- generation techniques to increase SMT performance in the absence of software-generated thread-level parallelism. The techniques being investigating include multiple path execution, instruction recycling, and speculative loop execution. Threaded Multiple-path Execution (TME) takes advantage of idle hardware contexts to solve the branch problem, speculatively executing multiple paths through conditional branches in a single application. Instruction Recycling increases the efficiency of multiple-path execution, as it avoids refetching instructions which are not path-dependent on a branch, and avoids re-executing instructions that are not data-dependent on the branch. Speculative Loop Parallelism speculatively executes multiple future loop iterations in parallel, using compiler analysis and dynamic hardware detection of loops and induction statements.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9806745 Kfoury, Assaf J. Wells, Joseph B. Boston University Experimental Software Systems: Collaborative Research: Applications of Flow Types in the Efficient, Modular, and Reliable Compilation of Higher-Order Typed Languages Modern programming languages (e.g. ML, Haskell, Scheme, Java) have several expressive features that let programmers abstract away from low-level, system-specific details and achieve benefits like code safety, code reuse, and modularity. Unfortunately, these features are challenging to implement efficiently in a compiler. The central difficulty is that the compiler must decide what concrete representations to assign to different abstractions of the same type in different contexts. Traditional compilers (inefficiently) solve this problem by choosing a uniform representation for all data. This research, part of the Church Project (http://www.cs.bu.edu/groups/church) addresses this challenge by (1) embedding type and control/data flow information in the intermediate representation of the program, (2) maintaining the accuracy of this information through the stages of the compiler and (3) using this information to customize data representations based on context, and to drive several compiler optimizations. The goal is to experimentally evaluate the efficacy of these &quot;flow types&quot; to compile a modern language like ML. Products of this research will include a compiler workbench that can be tuned with respect to flow information, experimental results indicating the effectiveness of type and flow information in compilation, and the design, implementation and evaluation of a new framework for the compilation of program fragments.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">*** 9802191 Hollis This project builds on results from previous NSF grant IRI9420869: &quot;Magnetic Levitation Haptic Interfaces.&quot; The previous grant developed a haptic interface (force/torque feedback) interaction capability for computer users based on Lorentz magnetic levitation. The user interacts with a single moving part with three rotational and three translational degrees of freedom (DOF) floating above the desktop. Combined with advances in physically-based simulation methods, it provided computer users convincingly real haptic (sense of touch) interaction with computers through six-degree-of-freedom (DOF) position input and 6-DOF force/torque output to the user&apos;s hand at resolutions of approximately 10 microns and a position bandwidth of approximately 75 Hz. The present effort seeks to make several technology enhancements and to quantitatively measure the psychophysical effectiveness of this approach. Comparisons are being made for haptic interaction with virtual environments and telemanipulation environments, and both of these with real environments to quantitatively clarify the differences between these modes. Methods for robustly &quot;caching&quot; local haptically-relevant regions of the virtual environment are being explored to smoothly synchronize the visual and haptic displays. Psychophysical methods are employed in the design of the human-computer interface to provide a controlled setting for conducting psychophysical measurements. Finally, detailed psychophysical measurements are being performed with the developed experimental system to quantitatively measure the degree of reality provided. The knowledge gained from this work provides needed information for the engineering science of haptic interface design while helping to elucidate the nature of haptic interaction itself. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project studies the benefits of combining two or more information retrieval schemes (data fusion). Methods are developed and tested using a large established test collection from the Text Retrieval conferences. The project is developing methods to predict when data fusion will be beneficial, and is developing methods that use non-linear rules of combination. The goal is to achieve a 15% relative improvement in the accuracy of predictions, and a 15% relative improvement in the effectiveness of the fused method. This project is motivated by the explosion of information in the World Wide Web, and includes development of specialized tests for comparing the new methods developed in this project to other &quot;meta-search engines&quot; already on the Web.

It promotes faculty development activities and supports minority faculty members as they complete there Ph.D. programs. Through project LEARN, more students participate in faculty research in areas such as: Agent-Based Systems, Spatial Data Analysis, Real-Time Operating Systems, and Pedagogical Research on Multimedia and Distance Learning applications. This award will stir the department of Computer Science from &apos;mainly teaching&apos; towards &apos;teaching and research&apos;. The existing MIE Summer Academy Program will be expanded to attract more minority/women students to pursue Computer Science studies at BSU. A Student-based Support Network, enhancing the student-to-student academic support system and providing a forum for tutoring, mutual support and self realization), will be established. Project LEARN makes a significant impact on the whole chain of issues which are related to minority student recruitment, mentoring, research assignments, financial support, academic performance monitoring, networking and group-based activities and placement in graduate schools. Through this effort, Bowie State University is expected to develop further its computing science research capabilities involving minority students in greater numbers, paving the way for eventual increase in underrepresented degrees in the pipeline. It is hoped that through these efforts, the nation might find a successful model that will help in building a better racially and ethnically balanced technological enterprise for the benefit of its present and future generations.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">EIA-9806821 Burnett, Margaret M. Rothermel, Gregg Oregon State University ESS: An Experimental Environment for Integrating Testing and Debugging in Form-Based Visual Programming Languages Form-based visual programming languages (VPLs), which include commercial spreadsheets and various research systems, are widely used by both programmers and end users. Research shows, however, that form-based visual programs often contain faults, and that their creators often express unwarranted confidence in the reliability of their programs. The goal of this research is to develop effective testing and debugging methodologies for form-based VPLs. The strategy is to develop and implement algorithms that combine program analysis techniques with highly interactive visual techniques to support testing and debugging in form-based VPLs. Experiments evaluating both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the techniques will be conducted on various audiences programming with form-based VPLs. The widespread use of form-based VPLs makes it imperative that tasks such as testing and debugging be supported in a manner suited to the users of these languages; however, doing so may also yield new insights into ways to facilitate testing and debugging in other kinds of end-user programming environments and even in visual programming environments used by professional programmers.</data>

Practical interest in GIS has spurred fundamental research in several areas of computer science. However, this research has focused mainly on abstract problems, and technology transfer to GIS practitioners has been slow. This project seeks to develop an improved foundation for dealing with massive spatial data through a collaboration of researchers in computer algorithms, software systems, and environmental sciences. The research deals with GIS problems at all levels of abstraction-from applications to algorithms, systems, and tools. The algorithmic research builds on recent advances in geometric algorithms and I/O-efficient algorithms for problems that arise in GIS. The systems research seeks to develop and evaluate system support for I/O-intensive applications on networked clusters, incorporating experimental research in storage systems, memory management, and networking. The common focal point for all project members is a toolkit that supports practical implementations of GIS algorithms and applications. The expected outputs of the research are: (1) new algorithms for dealing with massive spatial data sets, (2) whole-system implementations of GIS algorithms on high-speed clusters, and (3) transfer of these computational advances into the practice of GIS in the environmental sciences.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9870724 Chase, Jeffrey S. Agarwal, Pankaj K. Duke University Experimental Software Systems: Geographic Information Systems on High-Speed Clusters: A Vertically Integrated Approach Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are important management and analysis tools in science, and government. Practical interest in GIS has spurred fundamental research in several areas of computer science. However, this research has focused mainly on abstract problems, and technology transfer to GIS practitioners has been slow. This project seeks to develop an improved foundation for dealing with massive spatial data through a collaboration of researchers in computer algorithms, software systems, and environmental sciences. The research deals with GIS problems at all levels of abstraction-from applications to algorithms, systems, and tools.

      <data key="e_abstract">This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program in research and development of specialized sensors and integrated devices. This activity is a joint effort of nineteen faculty from six departments in the College of Engineering, the College of Science, and the College of Medicine at Wayne State University, and of three scientists from Ford Motor Company Research Laboratories and the General Motors Research and Development Laboratory. The expertise of this group of scientists and engineers provides the intellectual underpinning for the training of seventy-two graduate students over the five-year duration of the award. Operating in a team research setting, IGERT students will focus on the development of `smart` sensors for applications in the strategically important areas of automotive systems, aircraft and spacecraft systems, enabling technology systems, biomedical systems, and energy systems. Active research programs in developing wide-bandgap semiconductors, organic film devices, graded pyroelectrics, thin film magnetic devices, and integration technology will be incorporated into a new comprehensive multidisciplinary graduate curriculum for IGERT students that will include a series of `hands-on` lecture and laboratory courses and seminars developed by participating academic and industrial scientists and engineers. IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program intended to facilitate the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of scientists and engineers to be well-prepared to take advantage of a broad spectrum of career options. IGERT provides doctoral institutions with an opportunity to develop new, well-focussed multidisciplinary graduate programs that transcend organizational boundaries and unite faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly interactive, collaborative environment for both training and research. In this first year of the program, support will be provided to seventeen institutions for new or nascent programs that collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF.</data>

This activity is a joint effort of nineteen faculty from six departments in the College of Engineering, the College of Science, and the College of Medicine at Wayne State University, and of three scientists from Ford Motor Company Research Laboratories and the General Motors Research and Development Laboratory. The expertise of this group of scientists and engineers provides the intellectual underpinning for the training of seventy-two graduate students over the five-year duration of the award. Operating in a team research setting, IGERT students will focus on the development of `smart` sensors for applications in the strategically important areas of automotive systems, aircraft and spacecraft systems, enabling technology systems, biomedical systems, and energy systems. Active research programs in developing wide-bandgap semiconductors, organic film devices, graded pyroelectrics, thin film magnetic devices, and integration technology will be incorporated into a new comprehensive multidisciplinary graduate curriculum for IGERT students that will include a series of `hands-on` lecture and laboratory courses and seminars developed by participating academic and industrial scientists and engineers. IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program intended to facilitate the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of scientists and engineers to be well-prepared to take advantage of a broad spectrum of career options. IGERT provides doctoral institutions with an opportunity to develop new, well-focussed multidisciplinary graduate programs that transcend organizational boundaries and unite faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly interactive, collaborative environment for both training and research. In this first year of the program, support will be provided to seventeen institutions for new or nascent programs that collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9870736&lt;br/&gt;Campbell, Roy H.&lt;br/&gt;Mickunas, Dennis M.&lt;br/&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental Software Systems: Dynamic Resource Management for a Network-Centric Operating System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project researches the operating system and resource management concerns for next generation network-centric, user- and application-oriented distributed systems that accommodate frequent change. The rapid growth and change of computing and digital communication taxes scientific and engineering endeavors involving computation. The research builds upon an innovative service model in which the distributed system customizes itself to better the fulfillment of user and application requirements. In this model, a user is no longer an entity that is local to one specific machine -- each user is a machine-independent entity that exists in the network and can transparently carry its profile across different hardware and software. A network-centric operating system manages and allocates the resources to support the user on heterogeneous platforms. Resource management encompasses a framework for architecture-awareness. This forms the basis for adaptable quality of service, dynamic security, and self-configuration. The approach supports distributed desktops, mobile workspaces, and legacy applications across a spectrum of resources including mobile Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), embedded systems, workstations, and supercomputers using wired and wireless communications media. Simply put, the goal is to manage the overhead associated with computer technological advances by factoring adaptive dynamics and reconfiguration into the resource management mechanisms and algorithms of distributed operating systems.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The purpose of this research is to examine empirically the effects of emerging computing and communications technologies on the performance of globally distributed teams engaged in a specific type of collaborative work - engineering design. The primary objective is to investigate how social and cultural factors shape usage and effects of collaborative tools, and in particular shape distributed team communication processes and team performance. Design teams comprised of engineering students affiliated with a consortium of institutions in Asia, Europe and North America, and engineers working with our industrial partners are provided with collaboration tools. Surveys and thorough interviews with team members before, during and after project work highlight the interactions between distributed group communication and knowledge distribution processes, computer-mediated communication supports, and cultural factors. The results of this research will provide new approaches for using computer-based communication and collaboration tools to help distributed groups overcome problems associated with extreme geographic dispersion and cultural differences. A particular application of the research is to improve the likelihood of success of teams comprised of members from differing regions of the world who remain in their home locations.

      <data key="e_abstract">Real-time systems in embedded application have proliferated over the past few years. Many such systems are being used in life-critical and other important applications, where the failure of the computer to meet some deadlines can have disastrous consequences. The need therefore exists to accurately evaluate the reliability of such computers. Failure in a real-time system can occur due to timing as well as to traditional causes such as hardware failure. Timing overruns are often the consequence of a complicated series of interactions between various elements of the computer, such as individual application tasks, the operating system, the scheduling algorithm, the system architecture, component transient and permanent failure characteristics among other things. It is hard to take account of such interactions in analytical models without resorting to simplifying assumptions which raise questions about the models&apos; accuracy and validity. Furthermore, traditional simulation to validate analytical models is very difficult because the failure rates that are being validated tend to be very low: system failure rates as low as .000000001 are involved. An earlier NSF-funded project developed the Rational Interpolation technique, and showed its usefulness in may compute applications. It created a framework in which various difficult modeling, control, and optimization issues can be attacked. The results indicate that Rational Interpolation is a powerful tool that can be used to complement other mechanisms of reliability and performance evaluation, especially in predicting very low failure rates. This project will involve the development of techniques and tools based on Rational Interpolation for real-time systems. While the focus will be on real-time systems, the results are expected to be useful in evaluating computers in other applications as well, such as random algorithms.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Variable Bit-Rate Control of Distributed Sensor Networks</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">An accurate model of an ATM communication network must take into account the buffer delays which are time-variant, and nonlinearities arising from buffer and source rate saturation and quantization. The time-variant buffer delays in particular play a crucial role in the dynamic behavior of high-speed networks. The ensuing nonlinear time-variant model however is extremely difficult to analyze. All existing work therefore rely on simplified linear piecewise time-invariant models. At simulation stage, network flow controller designs based on such models may appear satisfactory; however, when applied to a high-speed system, the true network often exhibits undesirable behavior in contrast to what is predicted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, a more realistic model for high-speed networks that includes time-variant delays and nonlinearities will be developed. A distributed sensor network (DSN) that operates in a highly dynamic environment is a particularly demanding application where the network time-variance cannot be ignored. Indeed, treating such a network by conventional piecewise time-invariant methods can lead to unacceptable oscillatory behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Communication and processing of signals from a DSN that utilizes a variety of sensors which may be distributed logically, spatially, and geographically, is an essential problem encountered in several areas, such as, robotics, automation, aerospace, medical imaging, etc. In such a DSN, decisions are made at each node in a particular hierarchical level by fusing data communicated from the lower levels. In a highly dynamic environment where the observed scene can change frequently and dramatically, it is essential that importance measures or weights are attached to nodes in the network. This allows allocation of `importance proportional rates&apos; to each node. Such a paradigm, when implemented via an ATM network with the available bit-rate (ABR) option, is shown to allow effective utilization of bandwidth, possibility of capturing transient network dynamics with minimal data loss, and adaptability to fast changes and faults. To accommodate `bursty&apos; traffic, buffer set points are allowed to be varied according to importance of corresponding nodes. Furthermore, network configuration guidelines that allow maximum utilization of the proposed variable bit-rate scheme are provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To ensure fault tolerance, each node is provided with a local controller whose parameters are chosen to guarantee the node rate to conform to the allocated weight within a specified settling time. The fundamental requirement of stability of such a time-variant network is achieved via recent results on robust stability. The same methods will be used to provide bounds on maximum delays involved and buffer lengths. This allows effective utilization of the proposed strategy of variable buffer set points. For the assignment of importance measures and weights to each node, Dempster-Shafer evidential reasoning techniques are invoked.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Multiresolution Data Representation</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The sheer size of modern scientific data presents significant bottlenecks that limit the value of the data. Fortunately, a scientist often only needs access to small subsets of the data at its full resolution. The identification of these &quot;interesting&quot; subsets is part of the data exploration process. An effective data exploration environment for very large data sets requires a hierarchy of data representations at increasingly finer resolution, along with an accompanying &quot;error&quot; measure that helps to identify the authenticity of each representation level. One example of research that could benefit significantly from such a representation is the study of clear air turbulence in the atmosphere. Using techniques of computational fluid dynamics (cfd), direct numerical simulations resolve both the smooth wave motion over most of the domain, and the turbulence, which occurs in small patches. These turbulent patches are important for airplane travel, satellite communications, and environmental studies. Simulations such as require hours of supercomputer time and produce far more output data than can be &quot;downloaded&quot; and visualized without time-consuming trial-and-error. This project aims at developing tools to transform such data into a multiresolution hierarchy with error measures and to provide associated interactive access and rendering functionality. Such an environment will provide researchers with interactive access to an order of magnitude more data than is otherwise possible. Such access will allow researchers to interpret their data in far less time than is now possible, and as a result, they will be able to run their simulations at ever more accurate resolutions. &lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.unh.edu/mdr/</data>

Through this effort, Fisk University is expected to develop further its computing science research capabilities involving minority students in greater numbers, paving the way for eventual increase in underrepresented degrees in the pipeline. It is hoped that through these efforts, the nation might find a successful model that will help in building a better racially and ethnically balanced technological enterprise for the benefit of its present and future generations.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Technology for Very Large Scale Collaboration</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Explosive growth of the internet and intranets is leading to explosive growth of electronic transactions and electronic collaboration. In the future, we will see vastly more need, and opportunity, for technology assisted collaboration on a very large scale. The goal of this research is to help create a solid and positive foundation for the development of future VLSC (Very Large Scale Collaboration) systems. VLSC examples include enterprise wide workflows (e.g. merged state and federal government procedures); electronic town meetings (massive real time multimedia conferences); and on-line democracies (national discussions and electronic elections). The approach consists of conceptual modeling, architectural design, mathematical analyses, simulations, and implementation of small scale prototypes. This allows us to pursue important issues of architecture, high level design, and low level design, all in concert. The results of this research will provide architectural principles and building blocks for the creation of flexible evolutionary workflow systems in which people can freely interact synchronously as well as asynchronously within structured as well as unstructured environments. http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~skip/ctrg.html</data>

RE is challenged to provide a framework for multi-disciplinary stakeholders to collaborate, understand, and negotiate on change, as well as to serve as a framework for the changes to be realized in the real world via the design and implementation tasks. The WinWin research project investigates models and their automated support tools that address the above challenges. In particular, the research investigates (a) Models of the RE tasks and processes by capitalizing on the opportunity to use an existing tool, called WinWin, as an instrument to collect data on RE activity in real-client projects involving various sites, domains, clients, and project teams, and (b) Automated support for the RE tasks by capitalizing on the opportunity to build on the WinWin tool as an experimental distributed RE support tool that mediates multi-stakeholders concerns and the RE context of such concerns. The expected results will provide a significant new level of visibility into the tasks and processes of RE as a framework for collaborating and negotiating on change and the types of in-process models and products and their role in change management and negotiation.</data>

For a long-term impact, the research activities are being organized under thrusts involving automated debugging tools, natural language processing, symbolic computing projects, and parallel algorithms and applications. The related synergistic research is being conducted via eleven projects encompassing those topics.

For a long-term impact, the research activities are being organized under thrusts involving automated debugging tools, natural language processing, symbolic computing projects, and parallel algorithms and applications.

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this research project, a collaborative award with IIS-9812764, is to create and disseminate a software infrastructure for building complex and large-scale information systems that are both distributed and robust. The path to such systems lies in viewing distributed information systems as multi-agent systems: computational organizations consisting of potentially hundreds of intelligent real-time agents. Robust information systems will adapt both their functions and performance in response to changes in system goals, changes in performance requirements, and changes in the available software and hardware resources. A multi-agent architecture appropriate for such systems is being developed that contains component technologies for local agent scheduling, multi-agent coordination, organizational design, detection and diagnosis of inappropriate behavior in face of environmental change, and on-line learning to improve the performance of the other components. To evaluate this research, a multi-agent simulation testbed is being utilized to conduct extensive evaluation of the individual technologies, an integrated system prototype, and the issues of scalability to large agent societies. The impact of this work is to provide software, techniques and empirical studies that will facilitate the construction of the next generation of robust information systems.&lt;br/&gt;http://dis.cs.umass.edu/</data>

It convenes an interdisciplinary community to work, think, and study in a computationally rich environment with deep information stores and powerful services, where ideas are tested through simulation and data is shared and visualized through natural actions. &lt;br/&gt;The project leverages major donations from Intel, IBM, Microsoft, Sun, and Bay Networks to construct a testbed extending researcher desktops to SMP servers, group clusters, a large campus cluster, and novel data-interaction devices through gigabit networking. This distributed pool of well-connected resources will be managed as a computational economy, which adapts automatically to changing user demand, system configuration, and component failures. It should enable advances in the computational algorithms and programming environments for solvers used in the simulation and modeling of earthquakes, star formation, and technology CAD on systems with deep memory hierarchies. It will address system design challenges of emerging high-speed networking technologies while developing foundations for the design of large, complex systems. It will motivate new ways of assimilating and interacting with large volumes of information and with each other.</data>

Randomization uses random choices in the execution of an algorithm; there are many examples in which it is known to give algorithms that are faster than other methods as well as simpler to implement. This project will develop two new courses on Radnomization in Computing and on Data Mining and Warehousing as well as introduce randomization techniques into about 10 other courses. The project team has extensive plans for planning educational objectives and measuring their success. A WWW site will be established for disseminating materials and results.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This CRCD project supports a broad group of investigators to introduce randomization as an algorithm design technique into new and existing courses at the University of Florida. Randomization uses random choices in the execution of an algorithm; there are many examples in which it is known to give algorithms that are faster than other methods as well as simpler to implement. This project will develop two new courses on Radnomization in Computing and on Data Mining and Warehousing as well as introduce randomization techniques into about 10 other courses. The project team has extensive plans for planning educational objectives and measuring their success. A WWW site will be established for disseminating materials and results.</data>

Aspray, William Computing Research Association Special Project: Evaluation and Institutionalization of the CRA Distributed Mentor Project The goal of this project is to increase the number of women entering graduate programs in CISE areas by providing opportunities for women undergraduates to be involved in research projects with female mentors at major research universities so as to experience research and graduate life. This goal is in accord with the need to increase the number of women in responsible, high-level positions in CISE areas. The project provides support for twenty-two women undergraduates in each of three years to work with experienced and qualified mentors during summer months. In addition, the project includes a significant evaluation component, a plan for dissemination of the results of the evaluation and a plan for working toward long-term funding and institutionalization of the project.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9804113 This research addresses two important problems in the design of large and complex distributed software systems, namely: a) the need to increase the reusability of software components by reducing, or in some cases, eliminating their dependency on interconnection patterns, and b) the need to establish confidence that the final architecture will meet performance requirements by the proper selection of interconnection patterns between atomic components and aggregate components. More specifically, the project focuses on the design of a language to describe the architectural and performance characteristics of components, connectors, and patterns of interconnected components as architectural building blocks; the composition of patterns and target system architectures from the building blocks; and constraints on the composition of patterns and target system architectures. This research also addresses developing a method for mapping a target system to an analytic performance model used to predict the performance of the target systems under various workload intensity situations. By characterizing the performance of components and their interactions, the overall performance of the target system can be estimated. The biggest impact of this research is in advancing the methods and software technology needed to reduce the costs and risks in the software development of large and complex distributed software systems.***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9870316 It is becoming increasingly common for mutually untrusting software components to be parts of the same program; examples include Java applets, ActiveX controls, Component Object Model (COM) objects, and extensible operating systems. Methods and tools are created that make it easier for programmers to write software components that will function securely when linked with potentially hostile components. This is done by combining research results on several topics: information hiding and language design, hierarchical modularity, dynamic linking, and access control. One result of this work is a set of tools that let programmers precisely control the visibility and accessibility of pieces of their software, allowing different views of a software component to be presented to different software clients depending on the provenance of the client code. Software tools are implemented and distributed to support this for programs written in the Java and ML languages.***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The primary objectives of the proposed research are: 1) Develop a new controller design methodology based around a combination of robust control and neural network reinforcement learning techniques. The strategy will combine the best aspects of robust control and reinforcement learning and yield a combined control design that is far more powerful than either acting alone. 2) Provide a theoretical framework for precisely analyzing the stability and performance properties of reinforcement learning controllers by exploiting and extending results from robust control theory. 3) Apply these results to the design of closed loop controllers by exploiting and extending results from robust control theory. 4) Implement and test these ideas on an experimental HVAC system. 5) Educate practitioners in industry about this new technology. 6) Integrate these ideas into systems and control curriculum. To accomplish these objectives, an interdisciplinary team has been formed consisting of a specialist in robust control from the Electrical Engineering Department, a specialist in reinforcement learning for neural networks from the Department of Computer Science, and a specialist in design, modeling and control of HVAC systems from the Mechanical Engineering Department. This interdisciplinary approach will advance the state-of-the-art in the theory of robust reinforcement learning control design, demonstrate these new methods on an experimental HVAC system and provide much needed improved methods for controlling HVAC systems in buildings. Eventual wide spread implementation of these schemes in buildings around the world will reduce energy consumption and extend equipment life.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The project investigates effective public Case-Base System (CBS) tool-kits using a validated Software Reuse Reference Model (SRRM). CBS-SRRM allows the software engineer to improve reuse practice by capitalizing on effective practice-based knowledge derived from different software development organizations&apos; reuse practices. CBS-SRRM provides software engineers with a way to utilize lessons learned by other organizations. The tool-kit also promotes recurrence of good reuse practices. The research focuses on a more effective means for software development organizations to find alternative solutions to problems in successful practice of reuse. We demonstrate that developing a CBS-SRRM that will allow software developers to learn how organizations similar to theirs have successfully adopted, utilized and managed this technology can support improved reuse practices. The plan is to research, develop and make publicly available what we and our affiliates have learned through our evolving set of case studies, surveys, interviews and experimental results. This plan is carried out by researching and developing a publicly accessible reuse practices CBS for the software engineering community using lessons learned and reuse experiences from successful enterprises based upon a validated SRRM that incorporates important technical, organizational and cultural factors needed in adopting, utilizing and managing reuse technology.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9870659 Tabor This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a broadly- based graduate training program at the interface of the biological, mathematical and physical sciences. The program, a joint effort of 21 faculty drawn from 9 departments and 2 national laboratories, will emphasize collaborative research on problems where the joining of mathematical and physical modeling with hands-on laboratory experimentation holds great promise. Particular areas of interest include arthropod evolution and population biology, cardiovascular physiology, image analysis, bacterial motion, physics of cell structures, and olfaction. Students enrolled in any of seven existing Ph.D. programs, will participate in a combination of existing and new courses, including a new three semester biomathematics seminar that will combine literature research, faculty-student group discussions and seminars by outside experts to explore topical problems. A new, biological physics laboratory course covering Brownian motion, membranes, biopolymers, chemotaxis and fluid dynamics will be required of all students. Students will be recruited through existing departmentally-based strategies, as well as special efforts sponsored directly by the graduate college. IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program whose goal is to sponsor the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of new scientists and engineers to be well-prepared for varied careers in the private and public sectors. IGERT provides an opportunity for the development of new, well-focused multidisciplinary programs that bridge traditional organizational barriers, uniting faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly-interactive collaborative environment for both training and research. In its first year, the program will provide support to 17 institutions for new or nascent programs that collectively s pan all areas of science, engineering and mathematics eligible for support by the NSF.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program in optical sciences and engineering that will prepare PhD students for a variety of careers in academic and industrial environments. This activity is a joint effort of twenty-six scientists and engineers from the Departments of Chemistry, Physics, and Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Colorado, and two affiliated institutes, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA). This group of scientists and engineers has established research collaborations and their collective expertise will provide the intellectual underpinning for the training of a diverse cadre of some ninety graduate students over the five-year tenure of the award. Optical science and engineering is particularly well-suited integrative research theme because its diverse components are extremely important in both basic research and industrial applications. The program&apos;s research components are clustered in three areas: optical control and manipulation of fundamental systems, optical metrology, and optical processing of information. Within these clusters, PhD training will address the unmet need for advanced degree graduates who possess the `Employable Quintet` of technical knowledge in depth, problem solving ability in a laboratory setting, flexibility in learning and working, the ability to work in teams, and clarity in oral and written communication. Ten percent of the IGERT traineeship positions will support students in an experimental Professional Masters Degree program that will include all aspects of the doctoral program except the dissertation project. IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program intended to facilitate the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of scientists and engineers to be well-prepared to take advantage of a broad spectrum of career options.

      <data key="e_abstract">9870676 Johnson This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a broadly- based graduate training program in mathematical, cognitive and computational approaches to understanding how diverse cognitive processes, including language, movement and reasoning, are learned. The basic phenomena to be addressed are of significant commercial as well as scientific importance because, for example, they form the basis for design of speech and pattern recognition software, and for the design of robotic systems. The program is a joint effort of 13 faculty from the Departments of Applied Mathematics, Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences, and Computer Science. In combination with institutional resources, NSF funds will provide stipends for 12 graduate students, 2 postdoctoral students and 9 undergraduate students each year, as well as for related costs of student research training. Graduate students will be required to satisfy existing coursework requirements of their home departments and to take at least three new IGERT advanced topics courses meant to span the three participating disciplines. During the first two years of graduate school, each student will complete an interdisciplinary research project before beginning thesis research. All IGERT graduate trainees and faculty will also participate in a weekly research seminar, biannual retreats, a yearly week-long mini- course lead by a visiting researcher and a national conference to be organized during the second year of the project. Postdoctoral fellows will jointly organize one of the advanced topics courses and will themselves receive additional training to complement that received during their own graduate studies. Undergraduate students will become involved through active involvement in summer research projects in the groups of participating faculty. IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program whose goal is to sponsor the establishment of innovative, researc h-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of new scientists and engineers to be well-prepared for varied careers in the private and public sectors. IGERT provides an opportunity for the development of new, well-focused multidisciplinary programs that bridge traditional organizational barriers, uniting faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly-interactive collaborative environment for both training and research. In its first year, the program will provide support to 17 institutions for new or nascent programs that collectively span all areas of science, engineering and mathematics eligible for support by the NSF.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Modular Distributed Manipulator System</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This research focuses on the control and motion planning algorithms for a new materials transport and manipulator system called the Modular Distributed Manipulator System (MDMS), which has applications ranging from flexible manufacturing to package handling. The MDMS comprises an array of actuators each of which can impart a directed force to an object resting upon it. This project develops testbed hardware and algorithms to coordinate the actuators to transport and manipulate objects. The theoretical contributions add to the existing literature on distributed manipulation, much of which addresses chip-scale actuators. The MDMS works on a macroscopic scale, where physical models are more tractable. In contrast to MEMS actuator arrays, where mass and friction are essentially ignored, the MDMS not only incorporates friction and mass, but also explicitly exploits them. This effort considers two primary operation modes: sensorless and sensor-based. Sensorless operation is easier to implement and analyze but does not provide the precision of sensor-based control. The MDMS also provides a testbed for evaluating distributed control strategies, and this research considers the tradeoff between centralized and decentralized control approaches. These algorithms will be demonstrated on an existing eighteen cell prototype. A larger, more advanced prototype will be developed to further test the concept.</data>

This framework will reduce the cost and time of real-time software development by providing the infrastructure necessary for building reusable multi-purpose real-time software components. In much the same way as today&apos;s consumers can buy software and hardware components from different vendors and construct a computing environment tailored to their needs, this framework can provide the means of building and integrating real-time system components so as to preserve their temporal correctness while making it possible to dynamically compute predictable end-to-end temporal guarantees commensurate with available resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We plan to demonstrate the benefits of our framework by building a testbed and executing representative applications on the testbed, drawn from both soft real-time systems such as multimedia, and hard real-time systems such as automated flight. Software development costs of these applications are expected to be reduced significantly by separating real-time application design from resource-capacity assumptions on the target platform, hence facilitating changes in platform capacity, configuration or load. This project is also to demonstrate how our abstraction of platform capacity (away from the programmer) can help build real-time systems that can tolerate a range of violations of their load and failure hypotheses by adapting application QoS dynamically to the resources available.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Fundamental Experimental and Analytical Studies in Ultra Wideband Radio With Application to Wireless Multimedia Communication</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">In this proposal a complete study of fundamental issues, both experimental and analytical, in ultra-wideband (UWB) radio is presented. The proposed work involves a strong interaction between experimental and analytical components, so that experimentally derived models can be used to design optimized algorithms, which can in turn be tested. For this purpose, radio, video, and test equipment is requested to complement existing facilities in the ultra-wideband radio lab (UltRa Lab). This equipment will be used for closely related research projects that support the development of fully mobile indoor video communication systems. The motivating wireless technology is spread-spectrum impulse radio which alleviates multipath problems, but must coexist in the same spectrum with signals in the frequency range from roughly 500 MHz to 2 GHz. The experiments are aimed at (1) quantifying the ability of different radio systems to coexist in the same band without mutually interfering, (2) quantifying the distortion properties of ultra-wideband antennas and propagation environments, and (3) measuring the effects of indoor radio performance anomalies on video transmissions. The equipment requested includes anechoic chamber components, a flexible software video compression system, high quality LANs that can be utilized in both the video and radio interference experiments, and a bit error-rate tester and other components necessary for interference and coexistence tests. These experiments will result in a database of channel measurements, which characterize propagation, antenna, and interference effects. The database will be used to extract statistical models which, in turn, will be used to develop algorithms for receiver signal processing and video rate control. This process of experimentation, model extraction, and algorithm development will be iterated throughout the duration of the requested support. Each of these experiments is briefly described below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Interference Rejection and Coexistence Experiments and Analysis (Scholtz and Chugg). This experimental work will explore the ability of impulse radio with power spectrum thinly spread roughly from 500 MHz to 2 GHz to coexist over short range channels with the myriad of other electronic systems in that broad spectrum. This effort will test coexistence with LANs, cordless phones, microwave ovens, wireless TV links, etc. The processing gain of the spread-spectrum techniques employed in the impulse radio will be checked and the dynamic range of current impulse radios will be tested. These experiments will determine the direction of research efforts on impulse radio implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Characterization of ultra-wideband antennas and propagation environment (Prata, Chugg, Scholtz). The experimental work to be carried out in the controlled environment of an anechoic chamber supports the characterization of ultra-wideband antennas for impulse radio, and the characterization of narrower-band antennas to evaluate their ability to receive/reject impulses. This environment will be used to evaluate new UWB antenna designs that provide more robust spatial coverage, better pulse shaping characteristics, polarization diversity, and to study the propagation of UWB signals through different kinds of materials. The equipment purchased under this grant is destined for an anechoic chamber atleast 15&apos; (w) x 15&apos; (h) x 30&apos; (l) to be constructed in the near future (architectural work on the building containing this chamber is beginning now).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Experiments with Software-Compressed Asynchronous Video over UWB Wireless Links (Ortega, Chugg). Two stages are planned in the experimental work with robust asynchronous video transmission. In a first stage, laptops and wireless LAN equipment will be used to test techniques, which are currently under study for rate control over a time varying channel. All video functions (compression, rate control, error correction, retransmission, etc.) will be implemented in software. In a second stage the algorithms will be adapted to operate over an experimental impulse radio link. At that point the results from the initial stage will be incorporated and also changes needed for the particular transmission conditions of impulse radio will be implemented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the student researchers supported under the requested funding will be involved in all three of these aspects. This research will be further supported by the UltRa Lab infrastructure, which has been developed recently under the support of NSF and through the Integrated Media System Center ERC and our industrial sponsors. The infrastructure includes laboratory space, equipment, a team of undergraduate merit scholars to assist in laboratory procedures, and access to circuit and semiconductor process expertise from both USC collaborators and industrial partners.

This equipment will be used for closely related research projects that support the development of fully mobile indoor video communication systems. The motivating wireless technology is spread-spectrum impulse radio which alleviates multipath problems, but must coexist in the same spectrum with signals in the frequency range from roughly 500 MHz to 2 GHz. The experiments are aimed at (1) quantifying the ability of different radio systems to coexist in the same band without mutually interfering, (2) quantifying the distortion properties of ultra-wideband antennas and propagation environments, and (3) measuring the effects of indoor radio performance anomalies on video transmissions. The equipment requested includes anechoic chamber components, a flexible software video compression system, high quality LANs that can be utilized in both the video and radio interference experiments, and a bit error-rate tester and other components necessary for interference and coexistence tests. These experiments will result in a database of channel measurements, which characterize propagation, antenna, and interference effects. The database will be used to extract statistical models which, in turn, will be used to develop algorithms for receiver signal processing and video rate control. This process of experimentation, model extraction, and algorithm development will be iterated throughout the duration of the requested support. Each of these experiments is briefly described below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Interference Rejection and Coexistence Experiments and Analysis (Scholtz and Chugg). This experimental work will explore the ability of impulse radio with power spectrum thinly spread roughly from 500 MHz to 2 GHz to coexist over short range channels with the myriad of other electronic systems in that broad spectrum. This effort will test coexistence with LANs, cordless phones, microwave ovens, wireless TV links, etc. The processing gain of the spread-spectrum techniques employed in the impulse radio will be checked and the dynamic range of current impulse radios will be tested. These experiments will determine the direction of research efforts on impulse radio implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Characterization of ultra-wideband antennas and propagation environment (Prata, Chugg, Scholtz). The experimental work to be carried out in the controlled environment of an anechoic chamber supports the characterization of ultra-wideband antennas for impulse radio, and the characterization of narrower-band antennas to evaluate their ability to receive/reject impulses. This environment will be used to evaluate new UWB antenna designs that provide more robust spatial coverage, better pulse shaping characteristics, polarization diversity, and to study the propagation of UWB signals through different kinds of materials. The equipment purchased under this grant is destined for an anechoic chamber atleast 15&apos; (w) x 15&apos; (h) x 30&apos; (l) to be constructed in the near future (architectural work on the building containing this chamber is beginning now).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Experiments with Software-Compressed Asynchronous Video over UWB Wireless Links (Ortega, Chugg). Two stages are planned in the experimental work with robust asynchronous video transmission. In a first stage, laptops and wireless LAN equipment will be used to test techniques, which are currently under study for rate control over a time varying channel. All video functions (compression, rate control, error correction, retransmission, etc.) will be implemented in software. In a second stage the algorithms will be adapted to operate over an experimental impulse radio link. At that point the results from the initial stage will be incorporated and also changes needed for the particular transmission conditions of impulse radio will be implemented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the student researchers supported under the requested funding will be involved in all three of these aspects. This research will be further supported by the UltRa Lab infrastructure, which has been developed recently under the support of NSF and through the Integrated Media System Center ERC and our industrial sponsors. The infrastructure includes laboratory space, equipment, a team of undergraduate merit scholars to assist in laboratory procedures, and access to circuit and semiconductor process expertise from both USC collaborators and industrial partners.

      <data key="e_abstract">9806822 Essa, Irfan A. Abowd, Gregory D. Georgia Institute of Technology Experimental Software Systems: Automated Understanding of Captured Experience The objective of this research is to reduce substantially the human input necessary for creating and accessing large collections of multimedia, particularly multimedia created by capturing what is happening in an environment. The existing software system which is being used as the starting point for this investigation is Classroom 2000, a system designed to capture what happens in classrooms, meetings, and offices. Classroom 2000 integrates and synchronizes multiple streams of captured text, images, handwritten annotations, audio, and video. In a sense, it automates note-taking for a lecture or meeting. The research challenge is to make sense of this flood of captured data. The project explores how the output of Classroom 2000 can be automatically structured, segmented, indexed, and linked. Machine learning and statistical approaches to language are used to attempt to understand the captured data. Techniques from computational perception are used to try to find structure in the captured data.

      <data key="e_title">Algorithms and Software for High-Resolution Imaging</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">High-resolution images are essential in many important areas of science, engineering, law enforcement, and medicine. The need to extract meaningful information from degraded images is vital in many areas such as aero-optics imaging, surveillance photography, confocal microscopy, and medical imaging. Sources of image degradation vary among application areas, but include atmospheric turbulence, turbidity in a fluid medium, motion blur, and numerous other effects. Image processing tasks such as image enhancement, reconstruction, and restoration are computationally intensive; the underlying physical models require the solution to data-massive and often ill-posed inverse problems where the solution may not depend continuously on the data. All such problems require significant research into the algorithm- architecture-application interaction and can profit substantially from the availability of high-performance software systems. Iterative solvers that exploit both the structure of the problem, and the parallel computing platform, appear to be the most viable candidates for diverse, large scale image enhancement problems. This research project includes the following technical topics: a) New iterative algorithms with effective regularization strategies for blind deconvolution image restoration using adaptive filtering and multichannel phase diversity methods. b) Acceleration of the iterative algorithms utilizing Krylov subspace based multi-level preconditioning. c) New algorithms which partially mitigate the ill-posed nature of the image restoration problem by integrating numerical and symbolic computational methods. d) Development of a high performance software package, entitled &quot;Parallel Image Processing Environment (pipe})&quot;, which utilizes the image processing algorithms developed in the course of this research.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9870710 DeLisi This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a broadly- based graduate training program in computational science and bioinformatics that emphasizes computational approaches to diverse biological problems, including functional and structural genomics, bioinformatics, neuroscience and cell motility. The program will be a joint effort of 26 faculty drawn from the Departments of Biology, Biomedical Engineering, Chemistry, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mathematics and Pharmacology, whose research interests reflect skill in both mathematics and experimental science. NSF support will provide stipends for 14 graduate students each year, and for related costs of student research training. Educational opportunities will require that the graduate students have or acquire basic knowledge of molecular biology and biochemistry, developmental biology, computation and databases. Advanced coursework will be offered in areas as varied as molecular evolution, biomechanics and engineering systems analysis. Short tutorials will train students in the use and modification of computer software and hardware needed for data visualization and analysis. The training program will offer weekly seminars and evening research discussions, and will host two national workshops devoted to leading edge scientific or technological issues in computational biology. The training program will include thesis research supervised by two mentors, training in written and oral communication, visits to industrial research labs and opportunities for extended industrial internships. Students will be recruited through varied efforts including, in addition to standard avenues, the use of the Science Engineering and Math Academic Support Network of the New England Board of Higher Education and the hosting of an annual, week-long workshop in databases and software for teachers from 15-20 small colleges and universities. Th e progress of the program will be monitored by an external advisory committee of distinguished industrial and academic scientists that meets annually. IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program whose goal is to sponsor the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of new scientists and engineers to be well-prepared for varied careers in the private and public sectors. IGERT provides an opportunity for the development of new, well-focused multidisciplinary programs that bridge traditional organizational barriers, uniting faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly-interactive collaborative environment for both training and research. In its first year, the program will provide support to 17 institutions for new or nascent programs that collectively span all areas of science, engineering and mathematics eligible for support by the NSF.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9870684&lt;br/&gt;Miller, Barton P.&lt;br/&gt;Livny, Miron&lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental Software Systems: Software Fondations for Experiment Management&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of a high-performance parallel and networked system is an evolutionary process. Systems start with models and simulations and progress through a sequence of implementation steps. At each step, the key question is how and how much did the performance change? This question is important when we are comparing implementation to models or simulations, and when we change an implementation to run with a different algorithm, library, language, number of processors, type of network, input, work load, or scheduling algorithm. This project is developing an Experiment Management facility, called X-Man, to provide an infrastructure to directly attack these issues. This infrastructure will be of immediate use by system developers, and those developing models and simulation environments. It will provide a point of exchange, comparison, and reference for cooperating development groups, supporting collaborative, geographically distributed development. The benefits from X-Man include: (1) Directly support the code development process, providing programmers with concrete understanding of program evolution. (2) Change benchmarking from an ad- hoc activity to one with a quantitative, well-defined structure. (3) Provide both infrastructure and analysis to support model and simulation validation. (4) A framework to evaluate the effect of dynamic systems, analyzing behavioral differences caused by adaptive algorithms.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program in integrated chemical sensor design. This activity is a joint effort of nine faculty from the Departments of Chemistry, Chemical and Materials Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. This group of scientists and engineers has established research collaborations and their collective expertise will provide the intellectual underpinning for the training of seventy-five graduate students over the five-year duration of the award. Students will have multiple mentors in this cross-disciplinary research setting and their graduate training will include multidisciplinary courses, workshops, and seminars; problem-based learning; and internships in industrial and government laboratories. Areas of research focus include molecular recognition, polymer design, genetic engineering, organized protein assemblies, new transduction principles, micromachining, integrated chemical sensor electronics, and signal processing. IGERT students will be recruited nationwide with emphasis placed on identifying and recruiting qualified individuals from underrepresented groups in science and engineering. IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program intended to facilitate the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of scientists and engineers to be well-prepared to take advantage of a broad spectrum of career options. IGERT provides doctoral institutions with an opportunity to develop new, well-focussed multidisciplinary graduate programs that transcend organizational boundaries and unite faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly interactive, collaborative environment for both training and research. In this first year of the program, support will be provided to seventeen institutions for new or nascent programs that collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The system developed in this project maps World Wide Web documents to Library of Congress subject headings. It contrasts with systems which accomplish classification of Web documents through voluntary classification by the public at large. This project is designed to automatically classify Web documents into subject headings of the Science (Q) and Technology (T) portions of the Library of Congress classification system, after being trained and tested on several thousand documents previously classified by library scientists and experienced document analysts. The system is an extension of a system which employs machine-learning methods combined with natural language processing and information retrieval techniques to produce descriptive phrases for journal articles in the domain of physical chemistry. The earlier system generated more than 80% of index phrases produced by trained document analysts with expertise in the domain. The current project establishes that these methods can be scaled up to address a much larger problem domain. In doing so it also addresses issues relevant to all of natural language processing and information retrieval (e.g., efficient use of contextual cues, and reduction of errors due to encountering vocabulary which is unknown to the system). Success in the project will significantly advance concept-based classification and demonstrate its applicability to the vast problem of finding information in the largely unclassified &quot;library&quot; that is the World Wide Web. It will provide an electronic equivalent to the physical phenomenon of library patrons going to those shelves which correspond to their favorite or most-used call numbers. http://www.cs.msstate.edu/artificial_intelligence/kudzu.html</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">ABSTRACT NCR-9730105 Hui Zhang Carnegie Mellon University Rick Wilder and Chuck Song MCI Joint with NCR-9730104 Edward W. Knightly Rice University Joint with NCR-9730103 Jorg Liebeherr Polytechnic University Integrated Resource Management for the Integrated Services Internet The IETF has defined several key components for enabling an integrated services Internet: (1) service classes, which define the service models for supporting end-to-end per-flow QoS, (2) a link sharing model, which defines how different organizational entities (agencies) can share the same physical resources, and (3) a resource reservation protocol, which provides the signaling mechanisms to support these services. While these capabilities are indeed revolutionary as compared to the current Internet, serious impediments remain to achieving the vision of a ubiquitous multi-service Internet. In particular, efficient resource management algorithms must be available that actually deliver these services to the applications. Packet scheduling algorithms must be devised that can meet the service requirements of heterogeneous applications and different agencies while, at the same time, exploiting statistical multiplexing; admission control algorithms must be designed to allocate the minimum amount of network resources without violating any of the service requirements. At present, no set of resource management algorithms is available that can provide multi-service capabilities while considering the complex dynamics among connections, services, and agencies. This project will provide the first truly integrated resource management infrastructure for multi-service networks. Taking a new and comprehensive approach at resource management algorithms within the framework of the integrated services Internet, we propose to develop: (1) A novel hierarchical link sharing service model and algorithm that simultaneously supports all of the services proposed by the IETF without sacrificing efficient utilization of network resources, (2) Traffic control and scheduling algorithms that are amenable to efficient implementation in high speed and scalable switching systems, (3) Admission control algorithms for an enforceable controlled-load service with statistical quality of service guarantees, (4) Robust admission control algorithms for measurement-based controlled-load services, and (5) Traffic control algorithms that provide graceful quality-of-service adaptation in the presence of transient fluctuations of the network load. This project will develop the theoretical underpinnings of integrated resource management algorithms for multi-service networks. Moreover, in a collaboration that involves an integrated services network provider (MCI Telecommunications), a network equipment vendor (Ascend), and academic researchers (CMU, Rice, Polytechnic), the PIs will build a complete prototype implementation of the proposed algorithms on the vBNS national network infrastructure. This reference implementation will provide a first-of-its-kind platform for experimental research on the integrated services Internet that will yield critical input to both practitioners in the field and standards bodies on the effectiveness of current and newly proposed resource management algorithms.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">EIA-9871053 Sameh, Ahmed Purdue University MRI: Acquisition of a Computational Environment for Scientific Computing This project proposes the acquisition of a multi-use computing platform to serve as a joint, top-of-the-line resource of cutting-edge research in high performance computing, geometric modeling and visualization and system software support for parallel computers. The proposed infrastructure consists of a 32 processor SGI Origin 2000 (with 195 MHz R10000 processors upgradable to 250 MHz R10000, and subsequently to 300 MHz R12000 processors) and Infinite Reality Graphics (two pipes). This infrastructure is an ideal platform for supporting various research activities. It provides system software designers with a memory organization on which they can test and develop software capable of optimizing applications for deep cache hierarchies. The distributed shared memory provides application developers an easy transition from serial to parallel programs using threaded and directive-based APIs while still supporting message passing libraries such as MPI. The infinite reality engines provide powerful graphics and visualization capabilities for supporting computer-intensive design and simulation applications. With the upgrade path to R12000 CPUs, the infrastructure is likely to remain a state-of-the-are computing facility for the next several years.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">EIA-9871058 DeFanti, Thomas A. Brown, Maxine D. University of Illinois Chicago MRI: Instrumentation Development for Human-Centered Tele-Immersion The Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago has developed an aggressive program over the past decade to partner with dozens of computations scientists and engineers all over the Nation. The focus of this effort has been to create visualization and virtual reality (VR) devices and applications for collaborative exploration of scientific and engineering data. Since 1995, the EVL research and development activities have incorporated emerging high bandwidth networks like the vBNS, in an effort now called Tele-Immersion. As a result of past experience in building first and second generation VR devices to support these applications, the EVL now wishes to conduct research in third-generation VR devices to construct variable resolution and desktop/office-sized displays. Since no current technology is yet configurable with ideal resolution and size, there is a need to simulate these devices with available parts, and then build more advanced prototypes. This proposal requests significant equipment funds to buy, evaluate, and integrate a variety of emerging display devices, such as large color plasma displays, LCD projectors, LED panels, Feffo-electric Liquid Crystal displays and Digital Macro Mirror Displays. This proposal also requests funds to purchase new workstations for use by the EVL&apos;s 50+ students, and dozen faculty and staff. The proposal aims at long-term, basic display configuration research and development.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This CRCD project supports the development of materials for teaching Hardware and Software Codesign. This addresses design for digital systems that are built with a combination of specialized circuits, general purpose microprocessors, and software. Traditional courses examine such systems as their separate hardware and software parts under the assumption that the other part is fixed. Codesign allows examining how decisions in one domain affect the other domain. This project will build on research in simulators for codesign use; the project will build a simulator version for teaching use and incorporate it into a senior design course and will introduce codesign concepts in other courses. A workbook, text, or interactive CD-ROM will be produced to distribute this material. Overall, this project will introduce more realistic design projects into the curriculum and enable more realistic optimization of design projects.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9806751&lt;br/&gt;Singh, Jaswinder Pal&lt;br/&gt;Li, Kai&lt;br/&gt;Princeton University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental Software Systems: Integrated Applications and Systems Research in Software Shared Memory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A coherent shared address space (SAS) is an attractive programming model for parallel computing. It is emerging as commercially successful when implemented in hardware on tightly coupled multiprocessors. With less tightly coupled clusters of workstations or symmetric multiprocessors becoming important platforms, it is important to support this model in software on clusters as well. Otherwise, the need to run applications on both types of platforms may drive the more difficult explicit message passing model to dominate. This research develops and evaluates software SAS systems on clusters of various scales and organizations. The research is distinguished by being highly application-driven, including collaboration with application scientists. It examines protocols/systems and applications simultaneously without treating either as fixed. Protocols and systems are enhanced based on bottlenecks encountered in real applications, the role of hardware support is examined, and different software approaches are compared. The focus is on both programming ease and performance, and includes comparing the SAS and message passing models on tightly-coupled systems and clusters. The research will result in new, scalable software SAS systems, a greater integration of applications and systems research that is now necessary for major advances, and a better understanding of the tradeoffs in programming models across platforms.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this research is to develop a robotic system that will extend a human&apos;s ability to perform small-scale (sub-millimeter) manipulation tasks requiring human judgement, sensory integration and hand-eye coordination. A novel approach, called &quot;steady hand&quot; micro- manipulation is for tools to be held simultaneously both by the operator&apos;s hand and a specially designed robot arm. The robot cs controller senses forces exerted by the operator on the tool and by the tool on the environment, and uses this information in various control modes to provide smooth, tremor-free precise positional control and force scaling. The result will be a manipulation system with the precision and sensitivity of a machine, but with the manipulative transparency and immediacy of hand-held tools for tasks characterized by compliant or semi-rigid contacts with the environment. Some specific goals of the research include: 1) a novel robotic system specifically designed for cooperative steady hand micro-manipulation research; 2) Control theory for stable cooperative force and position control; 3) Information-enhanced cooperative steady- hand manipulation: 4) Experimental validation in realistic micro-manipulation task environments.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Future high-speed computer networks are projected to carry a dizzying array of networked multimedia applications including digital libraries, video and image servers, distance learning and collaboration, networked virtual environments, and entertainment. A common thread among these applications is the so-called &quot;continuous&quot; nature of their data. In continuous media (CM) data, strict timing relationships exist, which define the schedule by which CM data must be rendered (e.g., a video displayed or audio played out). In a network setting, the playout timing constraints, the rate variability of specific CM such as variable bit rate (VBR) video, the possibility of packet loss and delay within the network, and the desire to use network resources efficiently together combine to make the transport of CM data an exceptionally challenging problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important class of continuous media is stored continuous media. This differs from live continuous media in several ways. First, CM traffic characteristics are typically known ahead of time. Second, CM data is often characterized by a more relaxed requirement as to when playout can begin. Last, unlike live CM data, stored CM data does not provide the opportunity for changing the encoding rate in response to network congestion. In this proposal principal investigators (PIs) outline research aimed at the design and evaluation of algorithms and network transport protocols for supporting stored continuous media applications. These algorithms and protocols accommodate and exploit the unique features of stored CM (e.g., known traffic characteristics and the ability to transmit data further in advance of its playout time, the time-sensitive nature of CM playout).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research divides broadly into two areas:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Smoothing of stored continuous media. The PIs propose to develop and evaluate work-ahead smoothing algorithms for transmitting stored video to a client subject to client and network buffering constraints. The goal is to develop algorithms that compute CM transmission schedules that require a minimal use of network resources (e.g., have the smallest peak rate requirement, the smallest bandwidth requirement variability, and the smallest buffering requirements).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 2) Congestion control for stored continuous media. The PIs propose to develop and evaluate rate control algorithms that adaptively vary the transmission rate of a stored CM source in response to congestion within the network. Of particular interest are the resulting performance tradeoffs among interfering CM and non-CM connections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research has a particular emphasis on performance -- evaluating and understanding performance in a wide variety of settings, as well as formally establishing properties (e.g., optimality) of specific approaches. Other important themes in the proposed work include the importance of supporting client interactivity (e.g., developing approaches with small startup delays, examining the tradeoff between startup delay and resource requirements), the development of stored CM algorithms and protocols for a variety network settings (e.g., different network service models, as well as in unicast and multicast scenarios), and the complementary mix of theory and experimentation embodied in the proposed research.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Hierarchical Visualization Techniques for Data Mining</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project involves the development of interactive visualization and data management techniques for the exploration of very large multivariate data sets. The approach consists of extending several multivariate data visualization techniques currently implemented in an existing visualization tool (XmdvTool, developed at WPI) to support hierarchical views of the data, with support for focusing and drill-down using N-dimensional brushes. The stages of the project are as follows: (1) identify, design, and implement algorithms for hierarchical partitioning and/or clustering large multivariate data sets; (2) design and implement extended versions of existing multivariate visualization techniques to convey statistical summarizations of selected subtrees; (3) design and implement strategies for managing and querying large, hierarchical, dynamic data sets and efficiently computing summarizations of subtrees of the hierarchy; (4) design and implement interactive tools to allow focus, drill-down, consolidation, and other exploratory operations through direct and indirect manipulation; (5) evaluate and refine the visualization, data management, and interactive exploration tools using both real and synthetic data sets; and (6) assess system performance in terms of functionality, usability, and limitations on data which can be effectively explored. This project will result in the development of techniques for the qualitative mining of multivariate data sets one or two orders of magnitude larger than possible with existing visual exploration tools, providing application domains such as global change studies, space science, and decision support systems the technology to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies within their data sets. http://www.cs.wpi.edu/~matt/research/XmdvTool/</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This is an inter-institutional collaborative project carried out by Anupam Joshi at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Raghu Krishnapuram at the Colorado School of Mines. The goal of this research is to develop scalable robust techniques to model noisy data sets containing an unknown number of overlapping categories, and apply them to create a software tool for web personalization and mining. Personalization has two components: (1) tailoring the content delivered to the user from a web site; and (2) exploring the available web pages and categorizing them. The approach consists of developing new practical clustering algorithms by combining fuzzy methods, robust statistics, with Monte Carlo/bootstrapping techniques to model an unknown number of overlapping sets in the presence outliers. Since many web objects such as URLs, IP addresses, and web pages cannot be represented by numerical features, new techniques to handle web objects with linguistic and textual features, as well as to categorize or cluster them by using suitable similarity measures between such objects, are being explored. A software tool for web personalization and mining, which incorporates the algorithms developed into a software architecture, is being created and validated. The results of this project will generate new theoretical results and efficient algorithms for simultaneously estimating the parameters of an unknown number of overlapping categories from noisy data sets, as well as a web personalization and mining tool that will be made available on the web. Thus, this project is expected to have a significant impact on the way documents are searched for and delivered. It will directly influence the usefulness and spread of the Internet and WWW, and in general, will contribute to the digital library technology. http://www.cecs.missouri.edu/~joshi/web-mine/</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project investigates three distinct areas. (1) Average case complexity. The major goal is to enable one to prove the average case hardness of real-life decision and search problems. The research involves reexaming the basic definition of average-case reduction and average-case polynomial-time. (2) Finite model theory. The most challenging question is whether there exists a logic that captures the notion of polynomial-time on arbitrary (not necessarily ordered) structures. The PI has conjecture a few year ago that the answer is negative. The thrust of the research is the question what parts of polynomial time can be captured by logics. Another direction is extension of the methods of finite model theory to the study of finite structures with weights in infinite domains. (3) Abstract state machines. Abstract state machines is a new model of computation which has been successfully used to specify and verify real-life algorithms. Here this model is applied to complexity theory and finite model theory.</data>

In particular, the plan is to use tow main theoretical and algorithmic approaches to learning: Support Vector Machines and Hidden Markov Models. With these tools, two key aspects of a trainable man-machine interface will be developed: An analysis module that can be trained to estimate in real time facial expressions of the user and associated physical parameters and a synthesis module that can be trained to generate image sequences of a real human face synchronized to a text-to-speech system. The significance of the work is three-fold: (1) The project will contribute to the development of a new generation of computer interfaces more user-friendly and human-centered than today&apos;s interfaces. Such interfaces will be of direct use in education and as components of prostheses for the disadvantaged; (2) The project will integrate recently developed learning techniques to real time vision and graphics applications; and (3) The project will explore the boundaries of what is possible to achieve using 2D representations of faces rather than the more common, physically-based, 3D-based models.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Congregating Agents</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">In agent-based systems, agents can team in different combinations to cooperatively solve problems. Teaming, however, requires that agents understand each other and commit to concerted actions. In open, evolving networked systems, universal understanding and commitment are unlikely; instead, agents should congregate with those agents that they can understand and with whom they have successfully teamed in the past. Agent congregations are defined by commitments to common semantics and ontologies (conceptualizations of the world). Congregating improves the efficiency of communication and the likelihood of successful teaming. It can, however, impede the formation of effective teams whose members cross congregations, because agents need to learn new ontologies and incur overhead in searching for new congregations that meet their preferences. This project investigates how agent congregations are formed and how and when they should be reformed. The research includes simulations of large communities of agents, formal models of agency, and prototype systems. Its results will help guide the development of a national computing and communication infrastructure that supports the evolving identities and interests of scientific, educational, and commercial communities, and encourages communication between different communities. http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/wpb/conagents/</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This award supports research into the definition and development of a pattern language and pattern book for multi-agent systems, and the development of formal social structures and generalized social software artifacts for agent-based systems. The artifacts implementing the social structures are software-embodied entities existing separately from the intelligent agents that interact with them. Coordination and control tasks are divided between agents and the social artifacts with which they interact. This division of labor allows the use of coordination mechanisms designed to control the combinatorial explosions of coordination costs that are expected in systems with large numbers of agents. It also enables explicit control of emergent social behavior in agent-based systems. The pattern language will improve expertise transfer between developers and researchers in intelligent agent systems, and the social structures and artifacts will allow creation of coordination algorithms scalable to systems with large numbers of agents. http://www.eas.asu.edu/~gcss/</data>

      <data key="e_title">Graphical Structures for Coding and Verification</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Algorithms on graphical structures play a central role in both communications technology and formal verification. Minimal trellises are graphical representations of error-correcting codes that have emerged as a unifying framework for understanding and manipulating codes of all types. Ordered binary decision diagrams and their variants are graph-based data structures for representing Boolean functions that have found widespread use in formal verification for a range of problems, including circuit checking, logic synthesis and test generation. This project builds on the close correspondence that has recently been established between the code trellis and binary decision diagram, and investigates the transfer of ideas between these previously disparate fields. The fundamental challenge that confronts both uses of graphical methods is the same: devise techniques to combat the exponential blowup in the size of the graph. The research is interdisciplinary, and can be expected to have a broad range of application, both within coding and verification, as well as to such areas as artificial intelligence, database search, and combinatorial optimization.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9806645 Stewart, David B. Jacob, Bruce L. University of Maryland, College Park Experimental Software Systems: Hardware-Software Co-Design of an Experimental Real-Time Operating System and Microcontroller Architecture A hardware-software co-design strategy is being used to create an environment for real-time embedded systems, comprising a real-time operating system (RTOS) for microcontrollers, and a set of hardware mechanisms that enhance a microarchitecture&apos;s real-time capabilities. The project validates this experimental system through extensive testing on a simulated processor, and measures the cost-effectiveness of the hardware architecture extensions over a wide range of design choices. The central contribution on the hardware side is the addition of multiple &quot;nanoprocessors&quot; and software-managed caches to the main processor core; each of these is a software-configurable finite state machine (FSM) with limited processing capabilities, but each has access to most of the processor state. These hardware mechanisms are orthogonal to the underlying microarchitecture and can be implemented inexpensively even in a low-cost microcontroller. The RTOS implements all of its high-overhead operating system functions as FSMs that are mapped onto the configurable hardware. Each of the nanoprocessors becomes a personal assistant to the operating system, performing mundane tasks such as prioritizing interrupts, filtering input/output, or acting as high-resolution timers. This leaves the full 100% of CPU processing time on the main processor core for applications.</data>

Protein structure is, of course, fundamental to protein function, but equally important are the internal thermal motions that a protein continually undergoes. The basic problem is that protein structure is so complicated, and proteins have so many potential ways to move, that it is impossible to do a &quot;brute force&quot; simulation of all the possible protein motions and catalog their effects. The solution is to break the problem of describing protein motion into a hierarchy of problems, and treat each level of the hierarchy separately, moving from the most detailed to more &quot;coarse-grained&quot; descriptions. In each case, the numerical results from the most detailed calculation will be used as parameters for a more coarse-grained calculation. In order to predict function from structure, three levels of description will be developed: 1) quantum chemistry, 2) classical molecular dynamics, and 3) kinetic theory. The results from the kinetic theory will be compared directly with experiment.

In order to predict function from structure, three levels of description will be developed: 1) quantum chemistry, 2) classical molecular dynamics, and 3) kinetic theory. The results from the kinetic theory will be compared directly with experiment. To validate this approach, work will focus on ion channels, the membrane proteins that permit ions to cross biological membranes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All software developed in the course of the project will be embedded in the Biology Workbench (bioweb.ncsa.uiuc.edu). The Biology Workbench is a Web-based computing environment for molecular biology that assembles database and analysis programs from disparate sources into effectively a single program that any user can easily customize to his or her own needs.</data>

      <data key="e_title">WebTP: A User-Centered Web Transfer Protocol</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The World Wide Web is now a critical communication infrastructure for&lt;br/&gt;society. However, the foundations on which the Web is built are largely ad&lt;br/&gt;hoc and haphazard, with a protocol framework consisting of the hypertext&lt;br/&gt;transport protocol (HTTP) layered on top of the Internet&apos;s universal&lt;br/&gt;reliable delivery protocol-the transmission control protocol (TCP).&lt;br/&gt;Consequently, the performance of HTTP over TCP suffers from a number of&lt;br/&gt;deficiencies that are all rooted in the fact that TCP&apos;s byte-stream&lt;br/&gt;semantics are often at odds with user goals and the performance&lt;br/&gt;capabilities of end clients and servers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several ad hoc remedies have been proposed earlier to compensate for these&lt;br/&gt;deficiencies, e.g. parallel connections, persistent connections, and ACK&lt;br/&gt;pacing. However, all these solutions are overly constrained by the&lt;br/&gt;presumption of backward compatibility. We believe that the time has come to&lt;br/&gt;adopt a holistic and integrated approach embodied in a new transport&lt;br/&gt;protocol tailored specifically for the Web. Herein, we propose a set of&lt;br/&gt;research tasks to study, design, implement, test and evaluate our new ``Web&lt;br/&gt;Transport Protocol&quot; or WebTP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our approach is based on a conceptual model of user validation, application&lt;br/&gt;semantics, network and client states, and a flexible protocol that reflects&lt;br/&gt;this syntax and semantics. The conceptual model emphasizes the interaction&lt;br/&gt;between document structure, network state, and user preferences. Our&lt;br/&gt;research prototype will leverage the well-established and highly successful&lt;br/&gt;congestion control framework of TCP and vastly improve upon the existingWeb&lt;br/&gt;protocols by bringing user requirements into the design loop. To do so, we&lt;br/&gt;will apply the principles of Application Level Framing (ALF) to the design&lt;br/&gt;of WebTP. ALF says that to optimize communication paths within the&lt;br/&gt;application and across the network, an application&apos;s semantics (i.e. its&lt;br/&gt;user requirements) should be explicitly reflected in the design of its&lt;br/&gt;network protocol. Although ALF has been adopted in modern protocols like&lt;br/&gt;the Real-time transport protocol (RTP), paradoxically it has not been&lt;br/&gt;systematically applied to previously existing applications like the Web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will study the following questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* How do we best structure the ALF-based Web protocol in terms of&lt;br/&gt;congestion control algorithms, loss recovery schemes, packet framing&lt;br/&gt;methodology, header formats, toolkit APIs, and so forth? How do these&lt;br/&gt;design decisions impact network performance, user satisfaction, protocol&lt;br/&gt;complexity, and server load?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* How then does the client elicit user preferences in the least obtrusive&lt;br/&gt;fashion?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* How does the receiver (client) learn of the content structure of a&lt;br/&gt;server&apos;s Web data and combine that structure with its estimate of network&lt;br/&gt;state and user preferences to control selective transmission via WebTP?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* How should functionality and state information be distributed among the&lt;br/&gt;source (server or proxy), client, and user and what are the design and&lt;br/&gt;performance tradeoffs? How does WebTP scale with increased speed and faster&lt;br/&gt;clients?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our approach to these questions draws upon network engineering and&lt;br/&gt;communication theory, signal processing and stochastic control. We will&lt;br/&gt;use existing network emulation infrastructure from the the INDEX Project to&lt;br/&gt;comprehensively test and evaluate WebTP. This project holds the potential&lt;br/&gt;to dramatically impact the way we think about Web transport and will&lt;br/&gt;further contribute a design methodology, an actual protocol architecture,&lt;br/&gt;and performance analysis and results. We believe that our versions of WebTP&lt;br/&gt;will demonstrate dramatic improvements and pave the way for further&lt;br/&gt;developments.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9870713 Staley This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a broadly- based graduate training program in study of life in extreme environments and on its relevance to understanding the evolution of life on earth and, potentially, on other planets. Recent scientific results have highlighted the practical and theoretical importance of studying microbes that prosper in unusual habitats, including those whose temperature and chemical composition may well duplicate the conditions thought to exist at the time life evolved on earth. These results have also pointed to the utility of such studies in planning and evaluating efforts aimed at detecting environments on other planets that might also foster the evolution of life. This later aspect of the program is now often referred to as &quot;Astrobiology&quot;. The multidisciplinary program will be the joint effort of 14 faculty from the Departments of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Astronomy, Atmospheric Sciences, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Genetics, Geological Sciences, Geophysics, Microbiology and Oceanography, as well as internship mentors in the private and public sector. NSF support will provide stipends for 11 graduate students each year, and for related costs of student research training. Students will take at least three of five new courses to be created for the IGERT program, and must complete existing coursework requirements of their home departments. Required coursework will emphasize current knowledge of the evolution of life from prebiotic synthesis through development of Eukaryotic cells, and the physical and chemical principles of planetary formation. Along with participating faculty, students will participate in a weekly IGERT seminar and an annual workshop at a field site or laboratory that will focus on methods and techniques not available on campus. IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program whose goal is to sponsor the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of new scientists and engineers to be well-prepared for varied careers in the private and public sectors. IGERT provides an opportunity for the development of new, well-focused multidisciplinary programs that bridge traditional organizational barriers, uniting faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly-interactive collaborative environment for both training and research. In its first year, the program will provide support to 17 institutions for new or nascent programs that collectively span all areas of science, engineering and mathematics eligible for support by the NSF.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Wheeler&lt;br/&gt;9873326&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluid flows at and below the earth&apos;s surface are the cause and cure for problems of water and soil pollution, while petroleum and natural gas production depends on flows in the subsurface. In these problems, the length scales of practical interest range from tens of meters to kilometers. However, the behavior at these scales depends critically on physics occurring at much smaller length scales. A wide disparity in time scales also exists in these problems. Moreover, different physical processes occur simultaneously in different parts of the domain. In this project, the investigators and their university, government and industrial collaborators develop much-needed scientific understanding of small-scale phenomena from theory and experiment, and also develop new computational tools and strategies for incorporating this understanding at the practical scale, for handling multiple types of physics across subdomains, for remote collaboration, and for visualizing and manipulating the results. The project focuses on better understanding of small-scale phenomena (e.g., multiphase interfacial area, hysteresis, dispersion, and discrete fractures in porous media), interdomain coupling by means of multiblock or multiphysics methodologies (e.g., coupling of surface water and groundwater environments), the development of accurate and efficient algorithms and prototype simulators, and methods for viewing results interactively and with collaborators off site. The algorithms and simulators developed include novel mortar type spaces for coupling domains, and sophisticated, adaptive, finite element, finite volume and time-stepping methods for modeling nonlinear advective, diffusive and reactive processes. The algorithms are implemented on parallel computing platforms. Interactive steering and visualization are coupled closely to the simulators. Important work related to this project are laboratory experiments and field data for critical evaluation of the simulators, demonstration of prototypical simulators on petroleum engineering production models and environmental subsurface and surface flow applications, and educational and professional outreach and training through workshops, video and web-based technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns computer simulation and prediction of the movement and interaction of fluids in surface waters and subsurface groundwater and petroleum reservoirs. The focus is on fundamental multiscale and multiphysics applications (i.e., physical processes occurring together at different length and time scales and different physical processes occurring in different parts of the spatial domain). The motivation behind this work is the need to better understand and quantify the effect of small-scale processes on larger, field-scale processes, and to understand how different physical processes occurring in close proximity affect each other. The investigators study these problems through the development of appropriate mathematical models, numerical algorithms, computational science and visualization tools, and laboratory experiments. This work is carried out in collaboration with other university researchers and government and industrial partners. Educational outreach and training of future scientists and engineers is an important part of this effort. The applications of interest include petroleum and natural gas production, groundwater contamination and remediation, surface water circulation and pollution, and the interaction between surface and groundwater environments.

      <data key="e_abstract">Wheeler&lt;br/&gt;9873326&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluid flows at and below the earth&apos;s surface are the cause and cure for problems of water and soil pollution, while petroleum and natural gas production depends on flows in the subsurface. In these problems, the length scales of practical interest range from tens of meters to kilometers. However, the behavior at these scales depends critically on physics occurring at much smaller length scales. A wide disparity in time scales also exists in these problems. Moreover, different physical processes occur simultaneously in different parts of the domain. In this project, the investigators and their university, government and industrial collaborators develop much-needed scientific understanding of small-scale phenomena from theory and experiment, and also develop new computational tools and strategies for incorporating this understanding at the practical scale, for handling multiple types of physics across subdomains, for remote collaboration, and for visualizing and manipulating the results. The project focuses on better understanding of small-scale phenomena (e.g., multiphase interfacial area, hysteresis, dispersion, and discrete fractures in porous media), interdomain coupling by means of multiblock or multiphysics methodologies (e.g., coupling of surface water and groundwater environments), the development of accurate and efficient algorithms and prototype simulators, and methods for viewing results interactively and with collaborators off site. The algorithms and simulators developed include novel mortar type spaces for coupling domains, and sophisticated, adaptive, finite element, finite volume and time-stepping methods for modeling nonlinear advective, diffusive and reactive processes. The algorithms are implemented on parallel computing platforms. Interactive steering and visualization are coupled closely to the simulators. Important work related to this project are laboratory experiments and field data for critical evaluation of the simulators, demonstration of prototypical simulators on petroleum engineering production models and environmental subsurface and surface flow applications, and educational and professional outreach and training through workshops, video and web-based technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns computer simulation and prediction of the movement and interaction of fluids in surface waters and subsurface groundwater and petroleum reservoirs. The focus is on fundamental multiscale and multiphysics applications (i.e., physical processes occurring together at different length and time scales and different physical processes occurring in different parts of the spatial domain). The motivation behind this work is the need to better understand and quantify the effect of small-scale processes on larger, field-scale processes, and to understand how different physical processes occurring in close proximity affect each other. The investigators study these problems through the development of appropriate mathematical models, numerical algorithms, computational science and visualization tools, and laboratory experiments. This work is carried out in collaboration with other university researchers and government and industrial partners.

      <data key="e_abstract">9873339&lt;br/&gt;Caramanis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use the manufacturing environment as a paradigm for modeling and studying problems in distributed and hierarchical control under uncertainty. The primary objective of this project is to investigate and propose solutions to computational challenges that are the result of the proliferation of technologies which give rise to stochastic large-scale systems of unprecedented complexity. The second objective is to develop solutions and methodologies that not only meet the needs of the manufacturing supply chain coordination problem, but are general enough to be able to explore their impact on other areas of science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The manufacturing enterprise is one consisting of multiple, but highly interconnected, hierarchical layers. The size, nonlinearity, and stochasticity of manufacturing systems renders effective, let alone optimal, centralized decision making intractable. The approach followed in the past has been to relate the system&apos;s state to a number of variables, e.g., randomness, decision vector, cost, and then solve for decoupled components in a decentralized decision framework. This produces tractable, but inefficient, decision rules because of the assumptions made to allow solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to achieve systematic coordination of decentralized decision entities without compromising tractability of the problem. The issues involved span methodologies ranging from Stochastic&lt;br/&gt;Control and Large Deviations Theory, to Discrete Event Dynamic Analysis, Neuro-dynamic Programming, and Concurrent Simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since many of the techniques to be developed involve optimization and stochastic systems, the relevance of the methodological research on economics and statistical physics will be also examined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strong ties with industry will allow deployment, implementation, and testing in an actual manufacturing environment to be included as part of the dissemination and transfer plan for the research approaches developed.</data>

Neuroinorphic systems offer a platform for integrating insights from mathematics, neurobiology, and Computer simulation, and represent a new type of neural-based computing. Our approach arises from the premise that the traditional components of intelligence (including Sy requires a new technology; this technology will be provided by together as an integrated system. The study of such complex learning, recognition, and attention) are Properties of a common underlying neural structure, and that these compo ents are best studied neuromorphic systems engineering. Ncuromorphic VLSI chips stems and systems use subthreshold analog circuits to model dendritic computation and asynchronous digital circuits to model axonal communication . These systems can function autonomously or be interfaced with conventional computers. Neuromozphic systems offer the possibility of learning and recognition on real-time, real-world problems such as visual search and the recognition of biological motion.&lt;br/&gt;Our approach is based on spike-based computation: use of the precise timing of ncuronal spikes for representation and computation. Spike-based computations underlie some of the most impressive behaviors in biology, from bat sonar to human vision. In particular, we will focus on neuronal synchronization and will develop models in which learning, attention, and recognition all operate through effects on synchronization. Such models require neural mechanisms for the detection of synchronization (Recognition), enhancement of synchronization (Learning), and dynamic modulation of synchronization (Attention).&lt;br/&gt;We will use a team approach in which faculty and students work together on linked projects. The four investigators have expertise in complementary areas: neuromorphic chip design (Boahen), cellular biophysics and neural network simulation (Finkel), physiological data analysis and modeling (Gerstein), theoretical analysis of learning and spikebascd computation (Hopficid). Together we %ill investigate mechanisms for the control of synchronization based on changes in neuromodulation, on selective modification of&lt;br/&gt;AMPA/NMDA conductance ratios, on temporallyasyminetric synaptic plasticity, and on synaptic delay and spike-frequency adaptation. These simulations @l be tied to analysis of synchronization in spike-train recordings from awake, behaving animals engaged in learning, attention, or recognition tasks. Analysis of physiological and psychophysical data will motivate development of theoretical models of spike-based computation. Most critically, development of a series of neuromorphic chips will be carried out as a means of scaling up the simulations to systems containing over 200,000 spiking neurons each making thousands of connections. To facilitate development and sharing of ideas, we will develop a common simulation environment for analysis of spiking neurons that will allow an interface between large-scale network simulation, neuromorphic chip design, and analysis and prediction of physiological recordings. This enviroranent will be made available (via the Web) for widcr use by physiologists and modelers, and as an educational tool.&lt;br/&gt;Our current retina-based neuromorphic chips (Boahen, 1998) outperform CCD technology as a result of ncurally-derived mechanisms. These chips incorporate biological mechanisms for local gain control and motion detection. Prototype systems of interconnected spikegenerating chips will allow real-time feedback control of connectivity. We outline a plan for interfacing cortically-based ncuromorphic systems with high-speed multiprocessors to allow real-time attention, recognition, and learning on continuous video input streams. Recent ncurophysiological studies suggest that neuronal responses in alert animals viewing rcal-iiorld environments differ radically from responses to simplified stimuli. Such results argue for the study of neural-based systems interacting with real-world environments.&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of these studies will be tools, technology and insights that provide a new domain of interaction between neuroscientists, computer scientists and mathematicians and engineers. They will yield insight into the spike-based computations underlying intelligent behavior.

      <data key="e_abstract">9873463&lt;br/&gt;Finkel&lt;br/&gt;We Propose an approach to the study of intelligent systems based on the modeling and construction of neuromorphic knowledge systems. Neuroinorphic systems offer a platform for integrating insights from mathematics, neurobiology, and Computer simulation, and represent a new type of neural-based computing. Our approach arises from the premise that the traditional components of intelligence (including Sy requires a new technology; this technology will be provided by together as an integrated system. The study of such complex learning, recognition, and attention) are Properties of a common underlying neural structure, and that these compo ents are best studied neuromorphic systems engineering. Ncuromorphic VLSI chips stems and systems use subthreshold analog circuits to model dendritic computation and asynchronous digital circuits to model axonal communication . These systems can function autonomously or be interfaced with conventional computers. Neuromozphic systems offer the possibility of learning and recognition on real-time, real-world problems such as visual search and the recognition of biological motion.&lt;br/&gt;Our approach is based on spike-based computation: use of the precise timing of ncuronal spikes for representation and computation. Spike-based computations underlie some of the most impressive behaviors in biology, from bat sonar to human vision. In particular, we will focus on neuronal synchronization and will develop models in which learning, attention, and recognition all operate through effects on synchronization. Such models require neural mechanisms for the detection of synchronization (Recognition), enhancement of synchronization (Learning), and dynamic modulation of synchronization (Attention).&lt;br/&gt;We will use a team approach in which faculty and students work together on linked projects. The four investigators have expertise in complementary areas: neuromorphic chip design (Boahen), cellular biophysics and neural network simulation (Finkel), physiological data analysis and modeling (Gerstein), theoretical analysis of learning and spikebascd computation (Hopficid). Together we %ill investigate mechanisms for the control of synchronization based on changes in neuromodulation, on selective modification of&lt;br/&gt;AMPA/NMDA conductance ratios, on temporallyasyminetric synaptic plasticity, and on synaptic delay and spike-frequency adaptation. These simulations @l be tied to analysis of synchronization in spike-train recordings from awake, behaving animals engaged in learning, attention, or recognition tasks. Analysis of physiological and psychophysical data will motivate development of theoretical models of spike-based computation. Most critically, development of a series of neuromorphic chips will be carried out as a means of scaling up the simulations to systems containing over 200,000 spiking neurons each making thousands of connections. To facilitate development and sharing of ideas, we will develop a common simulation environment for analysis of spiking neurons that will allow an interface between large-scale network simulation, neuromorphic chip design, and analysis and prediction of physiological recordings. This enviroranent will be made available (via the Web) for widcr use by physiologists and modelers, and as an educational tool.&lt;br/&gt;Our current retina-based neuromorphic chips (Boahen, 1998) outperform CCD technology as a result of ncurally-derived mechanisms. These chips incorporate biological mechanisms for local gain control and motion detection. Prototype systems of interconnected spikegenerating chips will allow real-time feedback control of connectivity. We outline a plan for interfacing cortically-based ncuromorphic systems with high-speed multiprocessors to allow real-time attention, recognition, and learning on continuous video input streams. Recent ncurophysiological studies suggest that neuronal responses in alert animals viewing rcal-iiorld environments differ radically from responses to simplified stimuli. Such results argue for the study of neural-based systems interacting with real-world environments.&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of these studies will be tools, technology and insights that provide a new domain of interaction between neuroscientists, computer scientists and mathematicians and engineers. They will yield insight into the spike-based computations underlying intelligent behavior. The technology developed will have immediate application to robotics and intelligent neural prostheses.</data>

Supporting engineering and manufacturing activity in this future vision requires highly&lt;br/&gt;interactive technologies to conceptualize, design, test, plan, fabricate, and serve products: Virtual and Interactive Prototyping (VIP). There are three multi-disciplinary thrusts to achieve these goals: (1) Collaborative negotiation for engineering decision making; (2) Proactive design and simulation software systems; and (3) Design knowledge repositories, for archival and reuse of complex experience. VIP is a fruit of the growth in computer power and networking connectivity, and will dramatically reshape the&lt;br/&gt;relationships among creators and consumers. VIP increases the effectiveness of engineering teams, industry organizations and consumer communities that work together across distances and over time to rapidly and economically produce the most desirable products.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This is a three-year standard award. The ultimate goal of the Universal Information Access project is the full democratization of information and knowledge access, by removing -- or greatly lowering -- educational, linguistic and socio-economic barriers to effective information access and use. Progress towards this goal requires us to address the following challenges: (1) Translingual information retrieval, in order to access documents across language barriers, and across same-language jargon barriers, (2) Multi-level summarization, customized to the user&apos;s profile and information needs, (3) Automated hierarchical categorization, via high-dimensionality statistical learning methods, (4) Detection and tracking, of new topics and events of interest to each user as they unfold, and (5) Information validation as a function of source reliability and inter-source consistency. These capabilities will be integrated seamlessly into an information navigator&apos;s workstation, using a common underlying object model and a user-centric interface for visualization and management of information. These methods will be evaluated both with respect to quantitative metrics and with respect to user feedback from realistic tasks. Universal information access requires more than search engines and web browsing. For instance, much useful information may exist in languages other than English, or may come from sources of unknown reliability. Moreover, rapid analysis of information requires customized summarization, anti-redundancy filters, and hierarchical organization. Advances in these areas are beneficial to all disciplines which must cope with large volumes of rapidly growing information, such as scientific research, crisis management, international business, and improving our educational infrastructure. The proposed research, in addition to its clear impact on democratizing information access, should provide significant advances in: Information Retrieval, Machine Learning, Digital Libraries, and user-centered Information Management.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9873086&lt;br/&gt;Malik&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this award is to investigate the computational problems in sensing and control of a prototypical metropolitan area freeway transportation system, comprising a 1,000 lane mile network spread ver 100 square miles, used daily by 1,000,000 people in 500,000 vehicles. Technical challenges in sensing, state estimation, prediction, control and incident detection are addressed. Sensing requires real-time processing and fusing of data from loops, video cameras, probe vehicles, and cellular phones. Estimation of system state parameters (e.g. travel time distributions over numerous links) requires combining current sensor data, data from the immediate past, as well as historical data while maintaining spatial continuity constraints. Multiple scale models that can predict the evolution of system state over time and space will be developed and used to calculate real-time control actions for the available &quot;actuators&quot; (variable messages signs, ramp meters, signals) in order to improve performance. Based on learned characteristic signatures, the same models can be used to detect and classify incidents such as injury accidents with sufficient reliability to trigger appropriate responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this research will be to develop the core capabilities of a traffic management information system for the twenty-first century. While the current system is monitored by a variety of sensors and vast resources are dispatched to prevent system breakdown, in the absence of computational technology to estimate system state and to predict system behavior, both transportation managers and travelers make decisions as if they were blind-folded. Systems based on this research potentially offer huge benefits to both traffic managers and travelers. For traffic managers, they will provide a real-time overview of system performance and a quantitative analysis of the impact of various control options. For travelers, they can provide real-time information and advice during the planning and execution of their trips. The techniques developed in the project also potentially have application to other problems, such as air traffic control, which share many of its essential characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project investigates use of an additional layer of structure, called a meta-document, to organize decentralized network-accessible information, such as that found on the World-Wide Web. By developing meta-documents, documents whose components are themselves documents, discovered information can be placed into context and communicated to others. Consequently meta-documents hold promise of being useful in applications where information, created and maintained by others, needs to be transferred; educational applications at all levels have this characteristic. To make meta-documents effective, basic issues in information representation, presentation, personalization, structuring, location, and exploration are explored in this project. In addition, practical study is required of the means for authoring meta-documents and the means for keeping them in synchrony with the rapidly shifting contents of the Web. The resulting concepts have theoretical implications in understanding how to structure and communicate network-based digital information. They also have immediate practical application in producing materials that can be used in teaching and in providing overviews that will help the general public better identify relevant Web-based information on selected topics.&lt;br/&gt;http://www.csdl.tamu.edu/walden/</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This proposal by two principal investigators describes a three-year research plan aimed at developing a general theory of congestion control for high speed communication networks, allowing for cooperation as well as noncooperation among the users. The focal point of proposed research is flow control of traffic that can adapt to the congestion state of the network by regulation of the input transmission rate of packets into the system. This will involve the user of a rich set of tools from decentralized team theory, dynamic game theory, and robust identification and estimation. The framework adopted will accommodate many realistic scenarios, such as variable feedback delays, unknown feedback delays, bursty sources, and multiple bottleneck nodes to accommodate max-min fairness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research efforts along the lines described in the proposal should lead to major advances in the methodology and design of decentralized flow controllers for high speed networks, as well as to some new fundamental results in the theories of decentralized teams and dynamic games. They should also contribute toward making the methodology and the emerging design tools accessible to undergraduate and beginning graduate students in an engineering curriculum.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">State-of-the-art virtual environment technology immerses individuals in illusory physical and social environments which are under the complete control of the virtual environment creators. People act relatively unrestrictedly and in real time within such virtual environments. This fact has broad implications for basic and applied research in the behavioral, educational, and social sciences. This project focuses on immersive virtual environments as a basic research tool in four substantive areas: Learning, visual perception, social interaction and social influence, and spatial cognition. The research will help to answer basic theoretical research questions, and will establish the validity and reliability of immersive virtual environments as a research tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use immersive virtual environments to understand learning of scientific systems, including: presence (i.e., the feeling of immersion or being in a virtual representation of the scientific system such as a heart or a lung); guidance (i.e., free vs. guided exploration within a three-dimensional representation); realism (i.e., abstract vs schematic virtual representation); and verbal augmentation (i.e., audible narrative). The project will also use immersive virtual environments to investigate basic perceptual mechanisms underlying distance perception, perceptual-motor transformations (i.e., perceptual correction of visual distortions caused by external factors such as prisms), and perception of lightness and shape. Immersive virtual environments will also be used to explore and identify nonverbal communication characteristics that are essential to meaningful social interaction within and outside of virtual environments, and to conduct studies on fundamental social influence processes (i.e., social facilitation/inhibition, group risk taking, and ostracism) within virtual environments. Within the area of spatial cognition, the project will investigate how individuals aggregate local cognitive maps into global ones, and to investigate basic properties of alignment effects (i.e., how an individual&apos;s body orientation affects acquisition of spatial knowledge).</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Looking up the route to send a message is a major bottleneck in traditional&lt;br/&gt;Internet Routers. Traditional routers only use the destination address in&lt;br/&gt;a message to determine how to forward the message. However, in the last&lt;br/&gt;few years, there have been proposals for more sophisticated routers that&lt;br/&gt;are capable of what is called Layer 4 Switching. We believe that the&lt;br/&gt;capabilities provided by Layer 4 Switching in terms of security, quality of&lt;br/&gt;service, and guaranteed service will make Layer 4 Switching an integral&lt;br/&gt;part of the Next Generation Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Layer Four switching, the route and resources allocated to a packet are&lt;br/&gt;determined by the destination address as well as other header fields of the&lt;br/&gt;packet (such as source address, TCP port numbers etc.). Layer Four&lt;br/&gt;Switching unifies a number of recent trends (such as firewall processing,&lt;br/&gt;resource reservation, providing virtual private networks) into a single&lt;br/&gt;framework. The forwarding database of this new kind of router consists of&lt;br/&gt;a potentially large number of filters on key header fields. A given packet&lt;br/&gt;header can match multiple filters; thus each filter is given a cost, and&lt;br/&gt;the packet is forwarded using the least cost filter that matches the packet&lt;br/&gt;headers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flexibility and service differentiation provided by Layer 4 Switching&lt;br/&gt;comes at a cost. Given that traditional Internet forwarding based only on&lt;br/&gt;destination addresses is itself a challenge to implement at Gigabit speeds,&lt;br/&gt;Layer 4 Switching at Gigabit speeds is a difficult problem for next&lt;br/&gt;generation routers. In this proposal, we address the question of designing&lt;br/&gt;and implementing fast algorithms for Layer 4 Switching that can be&lt;br/&gt;implemented at Gigabit speeds even with hundreds of thousands of filters.&lt;br/&gt;We introduce three promising candidate algorithms (cross-producting, Grid&lt;br/&gt;of Tries, and Tuple Search).

      <data key="e_abstract">This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program in Environmental Manufacturing Management at Clarkson University. The goal of this program is to equip graduate students with strong technical skills and provide them with extensive exposure to the environmental, managerial, economic, policy, and communication aspects essential to progress in this complex field. This activity is a joint effort of sixteen scientists and engineers from the Schools of Engineering, Science, Business, and Liberal Arts at Clarkson University. Members of this group of scholars have established research collaborations and their collective expertise will provide the intellectual underpinning for the training of a diverse cadre of some forty-eight graduate students over the five-year tenure of the award. Students admitted each year will progress through the program as a cohort comprised of teams of doctoral students in science and engineering and masters students in management systems. Interaction among the faculty mentors will be enhanced through seminars and retreats. Research will take a systems approach. Integral to the program are industrial internships wherein research teams will interact with manufacturing personnel. A unique feature of this IGERT setting will be a new pilot manufacturing testing facility that will be used to evaluate technical, operational, and managerial alternatives to the manufacturing processes under study during the internships at a scale sufficient to obtain realistic performance and cost data. IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program intended to facilitate the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of scientists and engineers to be well-prepared to take advantage of a broad spectrum of career options. IGERT provides doctoral institutions with an opportunity to develop new, well-focussed multidisciplinary graduate programs that transcend organizational boundaries and unite faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly interactive, collaborative environment for both training and research. In this first year of the program, support will be provided to seventeen institutions for new or nascent programs that collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF.</data>

University of Utah MRI: Acquisition of Equipment for Telecollaboration, Telepresence and Design This is a request for major research instrumentation to significantly augment the ongoing telecollaboration and telepresence research effort spanning all five sites (Brown, Caltech, Cornell, UNC Chapel Hill and the University of Utah) of the STC for Computer Graphics and Scientific Visualization. Telecollaboration and telepresence are driving themes for the STC that stimulates and builds on research of four core research areas of modeling, rendering, interaction, and performance. The goal is to use projection display technology to &quot;control light at every square millimeter, every millisecond&quot; to create shared immersive environments that are sufficiently realistic to give the user a sense of &quot;being there.&quot; Some aspects of this goal can be implemented by acquiring or building special-purpose research instruments and other aspects only by conducting longer-term research on more powerful general-purpose research immersive sensors and displays. This research will influence the development of advanced telecollaboration and telepresence, which is expected to become as ubiquitous in the coming decade as single-user 2D windows-based computing is today. The set of requested instruments are categorized in terms of three research areas: networking, telecollaboration and telepresence.</data>

The goal is to use projection display technology to &quot;control light at every square millimeter, every millisecond&quot; to create shared immersive environments that are sufficiently realistic to give the user a sense of &quot;being there.&quot; Some aspects of this goal can be implemented by acquiring or building special-purpose research instruments and other aspects only by conducting longer-term research on more powerful general-purpose research immersive sensors and displays. This research will influence the development of advanced telecollaboration and telepresence, which is expected to become as ubiquitous in the coming decade as single-user 2D windows-based computing is today. The set of requested instruments are categorized in terms of three research areas: networking, telecollaboration and telepresence.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9873474&lt;br/&gt;Russell&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a unified theory of how natural and artificial systems can learn to solve complex motor tasks, such as running, diving, throwing, and flying, that entail significant sensory input and the coordination., sequencing, and fine-tuning of many low-level activities. Such a project is possible because of significant experimental advances in our understanding of motor control systems in humans and other animals, and because of increased sophistication in our mathematical models of control learning. These models will be used not only to analyze and predict natural phenomena in motor control, but also to derive effective adaptive controllers for artificial systems carrying out complex tasks.&lt;br/&gt;To generate complex behaviors, natural and artificial systems must be organized hierarchically with multiple layers of abstraction. The first research task will therefore be to identify appropriate levels of representation at which the physical system can be modclled and at which control actions can be defined. For example, in describing an insect flying from A to B, possible levels might be 1) nerve signals and mechanical properties controlling the detailed shaping of each wingbcat 2) basic wingbeat cycle 3) 11 steering&quot; the cycle to direct flight 4) takeoff, navigation, landing. Detailed motion, force, and/or airflow measurements will be made under a variety of experimental circumstances and tasks to establish the correspondence between formal models and physical systems. These experiments will be carried out for a variety of organisms, possibly including flying in insects, running in cockroaches, and for running, diving, and throwing in humans. These studies (and, in the case of insects, neurophysiological studies) will also establish the sensory inputs that are available at each level of the control system.&lt;br/&gt;Given the general structure of the control system and the appropriate sensory inputs, the next step is to design learning algorithms capable of learning to perform the given task successfully. The learning method to be used is reinforcement learning, a technique designed to adjust the control algorithm to optimize an objective function-that is, the long-term accumulated value of a specified reward signal. The reward is supplied to the learning algorithm as part of the sensory input. New reinforcement learning algorithms will be developed that operate using both local and global reward signals within a hierarchical control structure; furthermore, these algorithms will be proved to converge even using nonlinear representations of the overall objective function. This research should shed light on the central question of whether this form of learning in animals and humans can be viewed as driven by optimization or by some other principle, such as the preservation of fixed interface characteristics among the various levels of the system. Discovery of consistent reward functions in animals, especially humans, would have significant consequences for general theories of learning.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9873474&lt;br/&gt;Russell&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a unified theory of how natural and artificial systems can learn to solve complex motor tasks, such as running, diving, throwing, and flying, that entail significant sensory input and the coordination., sequencing, and fine-tuning of many low-level activities. Such a project is possible because of significant experimental advances in our understanding of motor control systems in humans and other animals, and because of increased sophistication in our mathematical models of control learning. These models will be used not only to analyze and predict natural phenomena in motor control, but also to derive effective adaptive controllers for artificial systems carrying out complex tasks.&lt;br/&gt;To generate complex behaviors, natural and artificial systems must be organized hierarchically with multiple layers of abstraction. The first research task will therefore be to identify appropriate levels of representation at which the physical system can be modclled and at which control actions can be defined. For example, in describing an insect flying from A to B, possible levels might be 1) nerve signals and mechanical properties controlling the detailed shaping of each wingbcat 2) basic wingbeat cycle 3) 11 steering&quot; the cycle to direct flight 4) takeoff, navigation, landing. Detailed motion, force, and/or airflow measurements will be made under a variety of experimental circumstances and tasks to establish the correspondence between formal models and physical systems. These experiments will be carried out for a variety of organisms, possibly including flying in insects, running in cockroaches, and for running, diving, and throwing in humans. These studies (and, in the case of insects, neurophysiological studies) will also establish the sensory inputs that are available at each level of the control system.&lt;br/&gt;Given the general structure of the control system and the appropriate sensory inputs, the next step is to design learning algorithms capable of learning to perform the given task successfully. The learning method to be used is reinforcement learning, a technique designed to adjust the control algorithm to optimize an objective function-that is, the long-term accumulated value of a specified reward signal. The reward is supplied to the learning algorithm as part of the sensory input. New reinforcement learning algorithms will be developed that operate using both local and global reward signals within a hierarchical control structure; furthermore, these algorithms will be proved to converge even using nonlinear representations of the overall objective function. This research should shed light on the central question of whether this form of learning in animals and humans can be viewed as driven by optimization or by some other principle, such as the preservation of fixed interface characteristics among the various levels of the system. Discovery of consistent reward functions in animals, especially humans, would have significant consequences for general theories of learning.</data>

Although many optimizations have been shown to be effective for greatly improving the performance of moderately size programs, the increasing complexity and size, as well as the modular design of applications make the optimization techniques too costly or not effective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research project is to develop and experimentally verify a scalable approach to compiler optimizations. Instead of simultaneously considering optimization opportunities across the whole program, as current techniques do, program paths are used to limit the scope of optimizations. A demand driven framework for analyses and code transformations forms the foundation for the development of the techniques. Benchmark programs from government, industry, and standard benchmark suites are targeted to test &lt;br/&gt;the scalability of techniques developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scalable techniques will be useful in industry to improve the performance of large programs, and the optimizer developed will serve as a platform to enable researchers to experimentally evaluate the scalability of optimizations. The demand driven analysis algorithms will not only be useful for scalable optimizations, but also for software engineering tools.</data>

Specifically, the following topics are investigated:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Link-time program analysis. The project will develop techniques for efficient and useful whole-program analysis, aimed at focusing the analysis effort on program components whose analysis and/or optimization can contribute to tangible improvements in program performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Whole-program optimization at link time. The project will investigate optimizations of executable programs, using classical techniques such as inlining applied to library code, as well as optimizations aimed at exploiting specific characteristics of the underlying hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Run-time optimization. The project will also investigate optimizations that depend on values that are computed while an application executes; these include optimizations that effect the amount of concurrency in a parallel application as well as how communication and synchronization are realized.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) operates the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). NCAR, with UCAR&apos;s leadership, will contribute to strengthening the atmospheric sciences. NCAR and UCAR will also continue to contribute strongly to the overarching goals in NSF&apos;s strategic plan. NCAR&apos;s priorities over the next five years fall into six main areas: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Fundamental Research. In keeping with the mission of NSF, the foundation of NCAR&apos;s program is fundamental research, particularly research of sufficient complexity to command the resources of a national center. This program includes solar physics, fluid dynamics and turbulence, cloud and precipitation physics, atmospheric chemistry mesoscale meteorology, and climate. &lt;br/&gt;(2) Understanding and Predicting the Earth System. Building on the broad base of fundamental research, NCAR and its many university collaborators will carry out major crosscutting efforts toward understanding and predicting the earth system. This includes research on prediction of weather on short temporal and small spatial scales, longer-term prediction of monthly and seasonal means, and studies of the influence of human, solar, and other forcing processes on weather and climate.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Advanced Scientific Facilities. NCAR will continue to put a high priority on developing new and cutting-edge scientific facilities that can be efficiently and cost-effectively supplied by a national center. This effort will include computing systems, instruments and observing systems, community models, datasets, advanced networking and communications tools, and provision of these facilities to the community.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Human Dimensions and Societal Impacts. NCAR will place increasing emphasis on studying the impacts of climate and weather on society; on human influences on the climate system; on society&apos;s ability to cope with weather- and climate-related impacts; and on the use and value of meteorological, climate, and other atmospheric-related information in a variety of contexts. &lt;br/&gt;(5) Education and Training. NCAR will continue and strengthen its efforts in education. The Advanced Study Program will support a strong postdoctoral fellowship program and graduate research assistantships to encourage the development of creativity, independence, and breadth in young scientists. Other educational activities will increase diversity in the atmospheric sciences. &lt;br/&gt;(6) Applications and Technology/Information Transfer. NCAR will transfer information, technology, and research results to the public and private sectors and to university colleagues and constituents in three major ways. Through direct transfer, public domain access to make information freely available to the broadest audience, and licensing.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Poggio&lt;br/&gt;9872936&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to learn to categorize and recognize objects is a key feature of the visual system of humans and higher animals. Yet, how the representation underlying these powerful visual abilities is organized and acquired is still largely unknown. The investigator and his colleagues tackle the problem of how the visual cortex learns to represent and recognize novel objects and object classes through a combination of computational, physiological and psychophysical approaches. The physiological experiments on alert monkeys rely on multielectrode recordings for which the investigators develop a tool kit of appropriate data mining techniques, based in part on their own work on learning and classification algorithms. In particular, the investigators undertake a multi-disciplinary research project consisting of four interacting components: i) Computational modeling of inferotemporal (IT) cortical neurons, extending their previous work on representations of single objects in IT; ii) cortical physiology using multiple electrodes in awake, behaving monkeys trained on between- and within-class classification tasks on novel classes of stimuli; iii) new data mining techniques for processing multiple electrode data, including classification and learning techniques; iv) visual psychophysics including fMRI studies in humans and monkeys, allowing to relate the findings from monkey physiology to object learning in the human brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding learning in the human brain means understanding the very core of intelligence. Not only is this one of the remaining fundamental challenges in science but it is also one area where even small steps forward will have significant implications for understanding neurological diseases and disorders, and also for the future of computing and machine intelligence. However, despite enormous progress in the last decade or two, science does not yet know what various areas of the cortex do and how. Because understanding the brain, the most complex system we know, is a huge endeavor, the present project focuses on understanding a part of cortex, involved in a key and very difficult task in everybody&apos;s daily life -- even if subjectively very easy: learning to categorize and recognize visual objects such as faces or cars. Understanding how brain cells come to represent objects will be a major breakthrough for neuroscience and also for eventually designing machines capable of achieving human-like performance. More importantly, any significant progress in the specific problem of object recognition will have a major impact on the goals of the KDI program, because it will open the door to understanding broader issues of learning and intelligence in brains and machines.</data>

In particular, the investigators undertake a multi-disciplinary research project consisting of four interacting components: i) Computational modeling of inferotemporal (IT) cortical neurons, extending their previous work on representations of single objects in IT; ii) cortical physiology using multiple electrodes in awake, behaving monkeys trained on between- and within-class classification tasks on novel classes of stimuli; iii) new data mining techniques for processing multiple electrode data, including classification and learning techniques; iv) visual psychophysics including fMRI studies in humans and monkeys, allowing to relate the findings from monkey physiology to object learning in the human brain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding learning in the human brain means understanding the very core of intelligence. Not only is this one of the remaining fundamental challenges in science but it is also one area where even small steps forward will have significant implications for understanding neurological diseases and disorders, and also for the future of computing and machine intelligence. However, despite enormous progress in the last decade or two, science does not yet know what various areas of the cortex do and how. Because understanding the brain, the most complex system we know, is a huge endeavor, the present project focuses on understanding a part of cortex, involved in a key and very difficult task in everybody&apos;s daily life -- even if subjectively very easy: learning to categorize and recognize visual objects such as faces or cars. Understanding how brain cells come to represent objects will be a major breakthrough for neuroscience and also for eventually designing machines capable of achieving human-like performance. More importantly, any significant progress in the specific problem of object recognition will have a major impact on the goals of the KDI program, because it will open the door to understanding broader issues of learning and intelligence in brains and machines.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program in Transportation Technology and Policy that offers a new pedagogical perspective embracing both the physical sciences and engineering and the behavioral sciences to illuminate the human side of adopting and dealing with the impacts of transportation technology. This activity is a joint effort of twenty-five scientists and engineers with backgrounds in mechanical and aeronautical engineering, statistics, management, transportation, civil and environmental engineering, chemical engineering and materials science, environmental science policy, natural resources, chemistry, and applied science. This group of scientists and engineers has established research collaborations and their collective expertise will provide the intellectual underpinning for the training of a diverse cadre of some seventy-five graduate students over the five-year tenure of the award. This IGERT activity in transportation education creates new courses, recruits non-traditional students, and offers new academic minors in traditional disciplinary departments. The anticipated outcome is an increase in the number, and in the quality of preparation, of transportation PhD&apos;s who are equipped to contribute to solving pressing and complex problems of the future. Other components of this multidisciplinary doctoral training program include fellowships, internships, seminar series, and conferences. IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program intended to facilitate the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of scientists and engineers to be well-prepared to take advantage of a broad spectrum of career options. IGERT provides doctoral institutions with an opportunity to develop new, well-focussed multidisciplinary graduate programs that transcend organizational boundaries and unite faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly interactive, collaborative environment for both training and research. In this first year of the program, support will be provided to seventeen institutions for new or nascent programs that collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program in Transportation Technology and Policy that offers a new pedagogical perspective embracing both the physical sciences and engineering and the behavioral sciences to illuminate the human side of adopting and dealing with the impacts of transportation technology. This activity is a joint effort of twenty-five scientists and engineers with backgrounds in mechanical and aeronautical engineering, statistics, management, transportation, civil and environmental engineering, chemical engineering and materials science, environmental science policy, natural resources, chemistry, and applied science. This group of scientists and engineers has established research collaborations and their collective expertise will provide the intellectual underpinning for the training of a diverse cadre of some seventy-five graduate students over the five-year tenure of the award. This IGERT activity in transportation education creates new courses, recruits non-traditional students, and offers new academic minors in traditional disciplinary departments. The anticipated outcome is an increase in the number, and in the quality of preparation, of transportation PhD&apos;s who are equipped to contribute to solving pressing and complex problems of the future. Other components of this multidisciplinary doctoral training program include fellowships, internships, seminar series, and conferences. IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program intended to facilitate the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of scientists and engineers to be well-prepared to take advantage of a broad spectrum of career options. IGERT provides doctoral institutions with an opportunity to develop new, well-focussed multidisciplinary graduate programs that transcend organizational boundaries and unite faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly interactive, collaborative environment for both training and research. In this first year of the program, support will be provided to seventeen institutions for new or nascent programs that collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The University of Pennsylvania and Boston University are collaborating on the establishment and maintenance of resources for research in sign language and gesture. The goal of this project is to make available several different types of experimental resources and analyzed data to facilitate linguistic and computational research on signed languages and the gestural components of spoken languages. Activities in the project include the following: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; * A facility for collection of video-based language data will be established, equipped with synchronized digital cameras to capture multiple views of the subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; * A substantial corpus of American Sign Language video data will be collected from native signers and made available in both compressed and uncompressed forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; * Significant portions of the colleted data will be linguistically annotated. The database of linguistic annotations will be made publicly available, along with the applications needed to access the database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; * Video data will be analyzed using computer-based algorithms, wtih analysis and software made publicly available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Thus the project makes available sophisticated facilities for data collection, a standard protocol for such collection, and large amounts of language data. The combination of linguistic and computational expertise in this project will ensure scientific integrity of data collection, and will result in useful data for researchers in a variety of fields.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project combines relevant, recent findings from psychology, education, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics in learning and knowledge representation and applies them to the development of intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Learning theory can be extended through the study of the evolution of different types of knowledge representations together with procedural representations. Thus, this research will examine learning, the change in students&apos; knowledge representations, as they integrate multiple sources of information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although ITSs have been developed to examine learning for well-defined problems requiring a limited set of possi-ble responses, ITSs have had problems evaluating open-ended questions that require the student to provide natural language responses. However, asking students to provide written answers to essay questions can provide a much richer representation of student knowledge and also improving students&apos; writing abilities. Thus, this research will demonstrate that ITSs can be developed which extend beyond simple responses and that these ITSs can adapt more readily to provide individualized instruction to students. In order to develop these ITSs, this research uses the computational linguistic technique Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to model student knowledge representations from essay-based answers within tutoring systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As students&apos; knowledge representations change, so too should their essay responses, including more knowledge and improving in quality. Therefore such an ITS can provide the necessary feedback for student improvement (both in domain knowledge and in writing skill). In addition, the ITS can initially assess the students&apos; ability and provide extra help to the students with help gradually fading as the student gains more knowledge (e.g., scaffold-ing). Thus, by incorporating LSA into an ITS, individualized instruction is possible for adjusting both the level of feedback provided and the content presented. The goal of this research is thus to study the acquisition of complex skills through incorporating LSA, a method for representing students&apos; knowledge representations through their essays, into intelligent tutoring systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because this research focuses on complex skills from knowledge-rich domains, results from this project extend theories of learning in psychology by providing information about how multiple sources of knowledge are integrated into students&apos; knowledge representations as they are learning . The research also has theoretical implications for educational psychology including the systematic examination of scaffolding for two content areas. In addition, because LSA is an automatic method for deriving knowledge representations, this research has broad implications for developing systems for training in any area of content knowledge.</data>

      <data key="e_title">KDI: Discrete Representations in Working Memory: Developmental, Neuropsychological, and Computational Investigations</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project aims to futher our understanding of the neural representations that underlie working memory. Working memory refers to the active maintenance of information in the service of complex cognitive tasks such as problem solving and planning. The team of investigator with study how the unique demands placed on the working memory system shape its representations during learning and development, and how these representations affect the use of working memory by the cognitive system as a whole. Their primary source of insight into this process will come from a computational analysis, which will be used to integrate and explore relevant findings from neurobiology and developmental and adult cognition. The primary hypothesis is that to maintain information in an active state over delays and in the face of interference, working memory representations should be discrete. A discrete representation admits to only a finite set of possible states, rather than representing continuous states. For example, the integers from 1 to 100 form a discrete set, in contrast to the real numbers in this range. Discreteness imparts a measure of robustness to the representation because small amounts of &quot;noise&quot; can be overcome by interpreting an observed state as the nearest discrete stat. From the central property of discreteness, a number of other properties follow. For example, discrete representations should be more categorical, more easily verbalize, better for perceiving or performing a sequence of steps, and more accessible to awareness. All these properties have component of the proposed research is to explore the idea that they all follow from the more basic property of dicreteness. The initial goal of the project will be establish through experimental studies the validity of the hypothesis that working memory representations are indeed discrete. This will be done by exploring a key behavioral consequence of this hypothesis: working memory representations should be more categorical than other representations. This predicition will be investigated with a set of existing empirical paradigms that have elucidated variables that affect the working memory system, including developmental age, delay, dual-task demands, and brain damage. Working memory plays a central role in most accounts of complex human behavior, because working memory is required in any task that involves multiple stos ir a temporally extended focus of attention. This kinds of tasks are important and pervasive throughout society, including: economic, political, and military planning; air-traffic control; and scientific research, to name just a few. It is essential to understand the nature of the representations in the working memory system and to understand how people learn to use working memory in the service of complex behavior. This research will advance our knowledge in this important area, and may provide insight into techniques for rehabilitation of working memory following brain injury and techniques for assisting the development of working memory in children.</data>

This predicition will be investigated with a set of existing empirical paradigms that have elucidated variables that affect the working memory system, including developmental age, delay, dual-task demands, and brain damage. Working memory plays a central role in most accounts of complex human behavior, because working memory is required in any task that involves multiple stos ir a temporally extended focus of attention.

It is essential to understand the nature of the representations in the working memory system and to understand how people learn to use working memory in the service of complex behavior. This research will advance our knowledge in this important area, and may provide insight into techniques for rehabilitation of working memory following brain injury and techniques for assisting the development of working memory in children.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project aims to futher our understanding of the neural representations that underlie working memory. Working memory refers to the active maintenance of information in the service of complex cognitive tasks such as problem solving and planning. The team of investigator with study how the unique demands placed on the working memory system shape its representations during learning and development, and how these representations affect the use of working memory by the cognitive system as a whole. Their primary source of insight into this process will come from a computational analysis, which will be used to integrate and explore relevant findings from neurobiology and developmental and adult cognition. The primary hypothesis is that to maintain information in an active state over delays and in the face of interference, working memory representations should be discrete. A discrete representation admits to only a finite set of possible states, rather than representing continuous states. For example, the integers from 1 to 100 form a discrete set, in contrast to the real numbers in this range. Discreteness imparts a measure of robustness to the representation because small amounts of &quot;noise&quot; can be overcome by interpreting an observed state as the nearest discrete stat. From the central property of discreteness, a number of other properties follow. For example, discrete representations should be more categorical, more easily verbalize, better for perceiving or performing a sequence of steps, and more accessible to awareness.

      <data key="e_abstract">This is a three-year continuing award. Collaboration is a hallmark of human activity. But today&apos;s society is becoming global, and digital networking-both wired and wireless-aims to serve geographically-dispersed participants. Networks of computers now become a mediating tool in human collaboration. And, their distributed architecture provides new opportunities for expanding human intellect and for enhancing knowledge work. But to be maximally useful the mediating system must be easy to use-preferably transparent to the user. Communication between human and machine should approach the naturalness of face-to-face exchange, where the sensory modalities of sight, sound and touch carry primary responsibilities for information transport. Additionally, supporting software must include intelligent agents able to fuse sensory data into meaningful commands for the machines. New technologies, now evolving, promise greater naturalness in human/machine communication-naturalness that substantially transcends the limitations of traditional mouse and keyboard. Incorporated with audio and video conferencing, these techniques include: eye tracking, visual gesture, hands-free speech recognition, speech synthesis, force-feedback tactile grasp, and manual gesture. Used in natural combination, these modalities provide the human greater dimensions of control and communication, and hence greater effectiveness in networked collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new research, aims to establish the basic understanding necessary for the creation and use of multimodal computer interfaces in wired and wireless networks. The research aims to produce a design methodology for multi-user collaboration across heterogeneous architectures and computing environments. As multimodal capabilities evolve, human performance must be addressed as a recognized component of the total system. Optimization of design therefore includes human-factors assessment to quantify the synergies that can be won from multimodal interaction. The new research identifies three application sectors where wired/wireless multimodal collaboration can provide new solutions; they include: Telemedicine (where expert participants may contribute to diagnoses for remote patients); Crisis Management (where disaster relief and emergency aid may be planned and deployed collaboratively); and Mobile Offices (where business activities might be conducted in transit-air, sea or land). The design framework resulting from this research is also applicable to other activities important in today&apos;s society, including: ubiquitous and universal access to information systems; increased interaction with the World Wide Web; education and knowledge dissemination; and, new aids for disabled individuals.</data>

      <data key="e_title">KDI: Multimodal Collaboration Across Wired and Wireless Networks</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This is a three-year continuing award. Collaboration is a hallmark of human activity. But today&apos;s society is becoming global, and digital networking-both wired and wireless-aims to serve geographically-dispersed participants. Networks of computers now become a mediating tool in human collaboration. And, their distributed architecture provides new opportunities for expanding human intellect and for enhancing knowledge work. But to be maximally useful the mediating system must be easy to use-preferably transparent to the user. Communication between human and machine should approach the naturalness of face-to-face exchange, where the sensory modalities of sight, sound and touch carry primary responsibilities for information transport. Additionally, supporting software must include intelligent agents able to fuse sensory data into meaningful commands for the machines. New technologies, now evolving, promise greater naturalness in human/machine communication-naturalness that substantially transcends the limitations of traditional mouse and keyboard. Incorporated with audio and video conferencing, these techniques include: eye tracking, visual gesture, hands-free speech recognition, speech synthesis, force-feedback tactile grasp, and manual gesture. Used in natural combination, these modalities provide the human greater dimensions of control and communication, and hence greater effectiveness in networked collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new research, aims to establish the basic understanding necessary for the creation and use of multimodal computer interfaces in wired and wireless networks. The research aims to produce a design methodology for multi-user collaboration across heterogeneous architectures and computing environments. As multimodal capabilities evolve, human performance must be addressed as a recognized component of the total system. Optimization of design therefore includes human-factors assessment to quantify the synergies that can be won from multimodal interaction. The new research identifies three application sectors where wired/wireless multimodal collaboration can provide new solutions; they include: Telemedicine (where expert participants may contribute to diagnoses for remote patients); Crisis Management (where disaster relief and emergency aid may be planned and deployed collaboratively); and Mobile Offices (where business activities might be conducted in transit-air, sea or land). The design framework resulting from this research is also applicable to other activities important in today&apos;s society, including: ubiquitous and universal access to information systems; increased interaction with the World Wide Web; education and knowledge dissemination; and, new aids for disabled individuals.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9870703 Nowak This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a broadly- based graduate training program that will equip students to combine the social, economic and biological sciences in the study of environmental problems presented by freshwater ecosystems. Problem areas to be emphasized will include studies of the economic value of environmental resources, the role of humans in the vulnerability of ecosystems to natural change, the impact of irreversible environmental changes, and the effect of ecosystem features on societal interactions. The project is a joint effort of 20 faculty from the Departments of Agriculture and Applied Economics, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Forest Ecology and Management, Limnology, Rural Sociology, Soil Science and Zoology. NSF support will provide stipends for 14 graduate students each year, for one postdoctoral student and for related costs of student research training. Educational opportunities will center on three required IGERT seminar courses, one on selected topics related to current IGERT faculty research, one on relevant research methods, and one on team research during which student teams will test hypotheses generated from the topics and methods seminars. Students will also spend at least three months as an intern in a Federal or Wisconsin State natural resources management agency. The postdoctoral student will both participate in and help organize the IGERT training activities, including an annual retreat for participating faculty and students. In addition to its education and research initiatives, the program plans a continuos self-evaluation effort led by a faculty member from the School of Education. IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program whose goal is to sponsor the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of new scientists and engineers to be well-prepared for varied careers in the private and public sectors. IGERT provides an opportunity for the development of new, well-focused multidisciplinary ograms that bridge traditional organizational barriers, uniting faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly-interactive collaborative environment for both training and research. In its first year, the program will provide support to 17 institutions for new or nascent programs that collectively span all areas of science, engineering and mathematics eligible for support by the NSF.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The aim of this project is to characterize the fundamental processes by which speech sounds are produced. Advances in speech technology are hampered because of incomplete understanding of these processes. Current knowledge does not successfully bridge the gap between classical approximation of speech as a linear acoustic description, and a full compressible Navier-Stokes (NS) description, which includes not only the sound propagation described in the linear model, but also the non-linear processes which produce the sound. To address this shortfall, the current research integrates three interrelated approaches for obtaining a deeper understanding of speech production: (1) synthesis of speech sounds using a NS solver, (2) experimental validation of the NS code through acoustic and fluid-dynamic measurements on a physical model, and (3) development and implementation of a reduced model of speech sound production. The expected result is speech synthesis of quality and naturalness surpassing that yet achieved, and a new model for speech generation. The results will lead to improved parameterizations for speech synthesis, speech recognition, and low bit-rate transmission.</data>

      <data key="e_title">KDI: Towards Ideal Data Representations</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9872890&lt;br/&gt;Ron&lt;br/&gt; Advances in communication, sensing, and computational power&lt;br/&gt;have led to an explosion of data. The size and varied formats for&lt;br/&gt;these datasets challenge existing techniques for transmission,&lt;br/&gt;storage, querying, display, and numerical manipulation, to&lt;br/&gt;the point where limits on their accessibility and portability may&lt;br/&gt;severely restrict their usefulness for human knowledge. This&lt;br/&gt;often leads to the paradoxical situation where experiments or&lt;br/&gt;numerical computations produce rich, exquisitely detailed&lt;br/&gt;information, for which, at this point, no adequate analysis&lt;br/&gt;tools exist. In order to address this challenge, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator and his colleagues develop a new technology for data&lt;br/&gt;representation based on the two basic principles of multiscale&lt;br/&gt;decompositions and redundant representations. Multiscale&lt;br/&gt;decompositions arrange data into strata reflecting their relative&lt;br/&gt;importance. This allows for rapid access to good coarse&lt;br/&gt;resolution of the data while retaining the flexibility for&lt;br/&gt;increasingly fine representations. Redundant representations&lt;br/&gt;allow for a multitude of data decompositions. While this on the&lt;br/&gt;surface appears contrary to the need for efficiency, the&lt;br/&gt;redundancy gives the flexibility of choosing `best&lt;br/&gt;representations&apos; from a unified family of representers and&lt;br/&gt;thereby provides efficiency and robustness. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;research is expected to deliver major results for: (i) accurate&lt;br/&gt;representation of image and acoustic data, (ii) parsimonious&lt;br/&gt;representation of high dimensional data, (iii) parsimonious&lt;br/&gt;representation of images and volumetric objects with&lt;br/&gt;singularities along curves and surfaces, (iv) acceleration of&lt;br/&gt;scientific/engineering computations.&lt;br/&gt; The KDI initiative takes place at a time when intellectual&lt;br/&gt;and commercial life are beginning to feel the effects of a&lt;br/&gt;revolutionary combination: sensor ubiquity, computational&lt;br/&gt;ubiquity, and internet connectivity. A clear priority in all&lt;br/&gt;fields of commercial, engineering, and scientific endeavor must&lt;br/&gt;be to identify and exploit the opportunities available in this&lt;br/&gt;new era. The center of the effort should be the intensive&lt;br/&gt;development of new schemes for representing digitally acquired&lt;br/&gt;data, and for rapidly manipulating those representations. In&lt;br/&gt;fact, advances in this central area have tremendous&lt;br/&gt;repercussions, accelerating progress in every other area. For&lt;br/&gt;astronomers straining to detect faint gravitational signals&lt;br/&gt;coming from the farthest reaches of the universe, or looking back&lt;br/&gt;in time to the earliest moments after creation, searching for&lt;br/&gt;temperature fluctuations that would give clues about the central&lt;br/&gt;theories of physics; for geophysicists looking for subtle&lt;br/&gt;deformations in the earth&apos;s inner structure for clues about our&lt;br/&gt;seismic future; for engineers developing new medical imaging&lt;br/&gt;devices; even for Hollywood entrepreneurs wanting more realistic&lt;br/&gt;computer graphic simulations for mass entertainment -- data&lt;br/&gt;representation plays a key role. To this end, this project&lt;br/&gt;assembles a team of experts to address issues of developing new&lt;br/&gt;data representations and new methods of analysis and&lt;br/&gt;manipulation.

      <data key="e_abstract">This proposal request support to enable American and International scholars and graduate students to participate in the Conference on the History of Science Information Systems, as well as to broaden the dissemination and impact of the conference discussions. The history of science is a well established scholarly field, but study of the evolution of scientific information systems is a relatively new topic, rapidly gaining in importance as the information revolution unfolds. This conference is the first event of significant scale solely devoted to the history and heritage of science information systems. It builds on and extends two landmark conferences. The first of these is the Scientific Information Conference convened by the Royal Society in London in 1948, and the second, the 1958 International Conference on Science Information, sponsored by the National Science Foundation. The present event is to be held immmediately preceding and in conjunction with the annual meeting of the American Society for Information Science (ASIS).</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">EIA-9871443 LeBlanc, James P. Jedlicka, Russ New Mexico State University MRI: Development of WISTE: Wireless Indoor Space-Time Environment The objective is to develop and operate a wireless indoor environment within New Mexico State University&apos;s electrical engineering building which is capable of measuring and statistically quantifying the space-time characteristics of the indoor wireless channel. Such an environment would provide benefit to wireless researchers as well as promote interest among university engineering students. To the researchers, the experimental results will provide an ability to infer appropriate signal-processing and channel-coding strategies. The instrumented environment will allow assessment of various hypotheses by providing measurements and models that help researchers better understand the spatial and temporal aspects of the wireless indoor channel. Measurements and statistical models will be made available to researchers nationwide through the Internet. This mechanism allows effective and timely dissemination of needed information on wireless communications and networking. To the university student, the environment will promote the graduate research programs due to the equipment&apos;s visible presence within the EE building and its use in both undergraduate and graduate classes. Furthermore, undergraduate students&apos; participation in performing such experiments will provide hands-on experience for those heading into industry.</data>

      <data key="e_title">KDI: Statistical Learning and Its Constraints</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Both humans and non-human primates show remarkable learning abilities. However, these abilities are often limited to certain domains, developmental periods, or behavioral contexts. For example, nearly all humans acquire one or more complex linguistic systems-that is, languages -- but not all humans acquire complex musical systems. Similarly, non-human primates are exceptionally adept at learning to forage for and categorize different types of food, but are severely limited in acquiring complex communication systems. Also, both humans and non-human primates appear to learn best in several domains during early periods of development. Thus, learning is nearly always characterized by specializations, rather than by general-purpose mechanisms. Understanding the constraints on learning will contribute to basic research, by accounting for domain- and species-specializations, and to applied research, by refining our understanding of which domains, ages, and contexts are optimal for human&lt;br/&gt;learners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the present research project is to explore the ability of human adults, children, infants, and non-human primates (Tamarins) to learn rapid sequential events. A prime example of a rapid sequential event is language, in which sounds are combined to form words, and words are combined to form sentences. Recent findings have demonstrated that human adults and infants can rapidly extract and remember very detailed &apos;statistics&apos; of linguistic input, such as the frequency and probability that one syllable will follow another. In our proposed research, we will employ miniature artificial &apos;languages&apos; which simulate some of the structural properties of natural languages, but which can be built with equivalent structures across different domains (speech sequences, tone sequences, visual sequences, motor sequences). At issue is the facility humans and non-human primates show for the extraction of statistical structure from these different learning materials. Are they equally sensitive to the distributions of elements and higher order structure in the materials? Do learning abilities differ across learners of different ages and species, and across different structures and domains?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to behavioral experiments with humans and non-human primates, a series of computational studies will allow us to investigate the formal properties of learning mechanisms, in order to ask what architectural and neural differences might underlie such differences in learning abilities. What kinds of computational architectures can learn the types of regularities and patterns that human infants learn? Is the inability of adults or non-human primates to learn some types of complex sequential events due to the absence of a learning device specialized for that domain, or could small differences in computation and/or memory lead to large differences in learning outcome?</data>

The experimental platform will be used for several research projects, including in particular, the four cited above. The first project focuses on deriving efficient software mechanisms for communication and scheduling for parallel applications. The second interdisciplinary research project plans to develop a High Performance Temporal Geographical Information System (GIS) on the NOW platform. The third project proposes to use this platform for developing efficient algorithms for unstructured mesh computations. The last project aims at characterizing the communication behavior of many applications.</data>

This meeting will be more informal than the annual ISSAC meetings, with ample time for unstructured interaction. Participation by the region&apos;s graduate students will be particularly encouraged through special invitation to contribute to the poster sessions, and through travel support. The meeting will have three invited speakers who have made outstanding contributions to the field of computer algebra. The speakers will anchor the meeting and will help attract participants.

Interactive speech (in the form of automatic recognition and synthesis) is a natural modality, which improves the effectiveness of human-machine interfaces. However, advances in speech technology have been limited due to incomplete understanding of the physical mechanisms of human speech generation. A particular deficit has been the lack of naturalness in speech synthesis. Equipment to be instrumented under this proposal will directly enable research on the synthesis of natural quality speech using a more complete description of the fundamental physics of speech generation (NSF contract #IRI-98-00999). The instrumentation will also support research on multi-modal workstations with which human users interact using sight, sound, and touch (NSF contract #IRI-96-18854). Additionally, the proposed instrumentation will enhance the effectiveness of the speech component in multi-modal interfaces through visual tracking. And, the speech interface will directly benefit from a machine voice that exhibits improved human-like quality.</data>

Interactive speech (in the form of automatic recognition and synthesis) is a natural modality, which improves the effectiveness of human-machine interfaces. However, advances in speech technology have been limited due to incomplete understanding of the physical mechanisms of human speech generation. A particular deficit has been the lack of naturalness in speech synthesis. Equipment to be instrumented under this proposal will directly enable research on the synthesis of natural quality speech using a more complete description of the fundamental physics of speech generation (NSF contract #IRI-98-00999). The instrumentation will also support research on multi-modal workstations with which human users interact using sight, sound, and touch (NSF contract #IRI-96-18854). Additionally, the proposed instrumentation will enhance the effectiveness of the speech component in multi-modal interfaces through visual tracking. And, the speech interface will directly benefit from a machine voice that exhibits improved human-like quality.</data>
