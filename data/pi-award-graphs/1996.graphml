      <data key="e_abstract">The proposed work creates human language resources to stimulate research in three important areas: (a) automatic language identification-- the problem of identifying the language being spoken; (b) robust speech recognition-- the problem of recognizing speech from different microphones, communication channels, and environmental conditions; and (c) speaker recognition-- the problem of identifying a speaker based on his or her voice characteristics. To support research in automatic language identification, over two minutes of speech from 300 speakers in each of twenty two language is being collected. To support research in robust recognition, about two minutes of cellular speech from several thousand speakers is being collected. To support research in speaker recognition, twelve hundred speakers are providing speech samples during ten telephone calls over a two year period. For each corpus, the speech is annotated orthographically, and a portion of each corpus is transcribed phonetically. A critical need for annotated speech corpora is met by this work: to stimulate research in three important areas of human language technology, leading to secure access to the information highway by any person who speaks a language.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Maly 95-54261 Building on its expertise in networking, computer supported collaborative work, and remote learning, Old Dominion University will prepare to build a statewide highly Interactive Remote Instruction (IRI) pilot system based on networked workstations. Technology and pedagogical methods developed in the system will be integrated into TELETECHNET, a state funded program in which Old Dominion University and community colleges provides four-year degree programs. The first two years are being taught at the community colleges with the last two being provided by Old Dominion University to remote community college campuses via networked and televised course instructions. The project will consist of a three-year phase of research, development, implementation and evaluation. Significant contributions include: 1) refining an existing IRI system to provide an open-ended teaching/learning environment with a set of basic features easy to use by students and faculty of all disciplines; 2) developing the basic concepts of new instructional methods to exploit the interactivity of the system in support of higher domains of learning; and 3) bringing together a consortium of government, industry and academic individuals who are dedicated to innovative approaches to education for the 21st century, and 4) providing Virginia with a cost-effective method of delivering high quality education remotely; and 5) serve as a model for other states faced with similar problems. The proposed open hardware/software architecture uses existing technologies but anticipates the wider availability of a high-speed Information Superhighway and multimedia workstations in the near future. The system provides two-way video to remote sites; shared operation of X-window tools and applications; interactive note-taking; a VCR-like replay of past classes and ancillary material and a full motion video window which can display the instructor, a classroom demonstration, or any PC, Macintosh or X-window application. These in structional capabilities enables instructors and students to access multimedia generated from a variety of sources and to use group collaboration tools for interaction between two participants, among small groups, or entire classes. The system will provide audio-visual interaction and allow faculty and remote-site students to share the manipulation of software tools, such as spreadsheets or chemistry models. While the elements of IRI are currently technically feasible, a major portion of the project&apos;s efforts are directed to the developing of new student-centered teaching methods and paradigms which take advantage of the environment and to refining the hardware and software through experience of actual instructional needs. This system will provide easier access to higher education for both traditional and non-traditional students, who for personal or financial reasons choose not to reside at a four-year institution. IRI will promote effective use of network and computer technology for all participating students and faculty.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The Santa Fe Institute will continue its REU program. The site will select a limited number of highly motivated and talented undergraduates who can benefit from exposure to the rich interdisciplinary mix of ideas at the Institute. Women and minorities will especially be invited to apply. Senior faculty mentors will be selected for their interest in the program and each undergraduate will be matched with one or more mentors who have research problems of real interest to the student and to which the student can make a significant contribution. Other resident scientists will be encouraged to take a regular interest in the intellectual development of the interns. The students will be encouraged to participate fully in the intellectual life of the Institute by attending colloquia and seminars and through informal discussion of their work with other resident researchers. Where appropriate, publication of scientific papers, attendance at workshops, and release of student-developed software will be encouraged by SFI. During each student&apos;s residency he will make a SFI colloquium presentation, compile a written summary of his work, and frequently consult with the program director. Students are encouraged to remain in contact with the Institute and their mentors as their careers develop, and, if appropriate, to return for subsequent scholarly visits.</data>

The real time control and computation system is associated with the robot requested under this proposal and other robots in several closely related projects. Specific research tasks are as follows. (1) Research and development of robot-assisted surgical systems. Most immediately, a system for directing linear insertions, such as biopsies and orthopedic pins, under fluoroscopic imaging. These systems require fast dedicated computers for control, and a 6-axis force sensor to facilitate interaction with a surgeon. (2) Research and development of assertive devices to be used in the final assembly of automobiles and light trucks, with General Motors. This project requires a considerable amount of high-speed real-time digital signal processing hardware, and associated software.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">CDA-9529520 Barreto, Armando B. Yen, Kang Florida International University CISE Research Instrumentation: Multiprocessor Workstation for Advanced Digital Signal Processing Research Emerging Digital Signal Processing techniques are being applied to the solution of challenging problems of signal detection and system modeling: Dynamic neural networks are used as spatio-temporal classifiers for the detection of electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns that can be elicited voluntarily, as part of the process of motion preparation. Reliable detection of these patterns will provide the basis for the development of a new form of computer interface that will be accessible even to individuals deprived of motor execution functions. Similarly, chaotic dynamics analysis is being applied for the detailed study of the three-dimensional propagation of ocean acoustic waves. Indices such as the Lyapunov exponent are numerically estimated using real sound propagation data collected in the North Atlantic to characterize the chaotic properties of the phenomenon. While these emerging DSP techniques hold great promise to increase our capability to obtain useful information from signals and develop accurate models of physical phenomena, they are complex and computationally intensive. The availability of multiprocessor workstations is necessary to shorten the algorithm development and analysis cycles (i.e., large-scale dynamic neural network training, numerical Lyapunov exponent estimation, etc.) to practical levels. Additionally, these systems will familiarize our faculty and students with parallel algorithm development techniques</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">CDA-9529541 Psarris, Kleanthis Das, Samir, R. Boppana, Rajendra, V. The University of Texas at San Antonio Research in Parallel Computer Systems Design using Workstation Clusters with High-Speed Networks This award is for the acquisition of a cluster of four multiprocessor workstations to support several research projects, including the research on the design of architectures and compilers for distributed shared memory multiprocessors and on large-scale applications such as the design and implementation of parallel discrete event simulators. The proposed instrumentation provides a multi-granular parallel and distributed computing platform, where both tightly-coupled and loosely-coupled systems coexist. It interconnects four Sun workstations with an SCI (scalable coherent interface) based high-speed network. The SCI interconnect will provide low-latency message passing and shared memory support. The SUN workstations with Solaris OS support threads and high precision clocks. The low-latency inter-workstation communication and threads will be used to implement parallel architecture simulators and parallel discrete event simulators. Precise clocks will be used to extract message communication and shared memory traces from applications.

The University of Texas at San Antonio Research in Parallel Computer Systems Design using Workstation Clusters with High-Speed Networks This award is for the acquisition of a cluster of four multiprocessor workstations to support several research projects, including the research on the design of architectures and compilers for distributed shared memory multiprocessors and on large-scale applications such as the design and implementation of parallel discrete event simulators. The proposed instrumentation provides a multi-granular parallel and distributed computing platform, where both tightly-coupled and loosely-coupled systems coexist. It interconnects four Sun workstations with an SCI (scalable coherent interface) based high-speed network. The SCI interconnect will provide low-latency message passing and shared memory support. The SUN workstations with Solaris OS support threads and high precision clocks. The low-latency inter-workstation communication and threads will be used to implement parallel architecture simulators and parallel discrete event simulators. Precise clocks will be used to extract message communication and shared memory traces from applications. These traces in turn will be used to evaluate the new architectural mechanisms through simulations.

      <data key="e_abstract">CDA 9529766 Khoshgoftaar, Taghi M. Ganesan, Krishnamurthy Florida Atlantic University Empirical Software Engineering Laboratory for Research in Software Engineering The proposed Empirical Software Engineering Laboratory supports following research projects in software engineering. (1) Modeling of Software Quality Using Artificial Neural Networks for improving the accuracy of software quality models by conducting case studies exploring neural network architectures and training algorithms. (2) Measurement and Validation of Software Testability for characterizing relationships between testability and static software metrics, and for determining whether or not testability measurement can enhance software reliability prediction. Case studies to address these issues empirically are used. (3) Fuzzy Case-Based Reasoning for identifying fuzzy case-based methods for software quality prediction by developing prototype systems using industrial case study data. These research projects are making significant contributions by characterizing ways that people actually develop software by using data on large systems from industrial partners which have professional development organizations. The equipment includes five high performance engineering workstations that are significantly faster than others that are available. Purchased software includes measurement and modeling tools that are specifically applicable to the projects. Thus, the hardware and software of the Empirical Software Engineering Laboratory are critical to the above research projects.</data>

These systems allow us to move beyond the interaction model of single user/single computer--with an emphasis upon shared interaction to mediate social aspects of learning, design, and planning. These paradigms integrate the use of physical objects--to support and encourage face-to-face interaction among the participants--with virtual objects--to provide computational support for the model underlying the simulation. When linked across a network, these systems can allow the interaction with simulations and among individuals at a distance. A two-phase prototyping process is being used: First, an initial version utilizing front-surface projection is being developed, allowing us to deal with some of the software and device-controller issues and demonstrating the applicability of the approach. Subsequent development will utilize newer technology to create a back-imaged system to resolve shadowing problems.

      <data key="e_abstract">9523969 Stuber The proposed research will develop new algorithms for fast link quality evaluation and new algorithms for distributed link control in microcellular mobile telephone systems. Link quality evaluation and control are essential elements of any cellular system. However, future microcellular systems will be characterized by large numbers mobile customers, and many (sometimes rapid) cell boundary crossings. Limitations on the speed of link monitoring and control essentially determine the overall link quality, the cell sizes, and the ability of the cellular system to react to traffic variations. These factors in turn determine the spectral efficiency and grade of service. As a result, fast link quality evaluation and distributed link control will be essential for the successful deployment of microcellular telephone systems. The approaches to be employed in the study involve a mixture of theoretical work in propagation modeling, signal processing, teletraffic modeling, stochastic processes, and control theory, as well as computation and simulation on workstations. A software simulation capability in presently available at Georgia Tech that uses either recorded strips of actual channel measurements or various theoretical and empirical models. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">CDA-9529509 Taylor, Russell H. Wolff, Lawrence B. The Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, Maryland Instrumentation for Computer Science and Engineering Research in Image Segmentation, Registration, Modeling, and Interactive Model-based Task Optimization A computation server and visualization workstation are provided for a new laboratory in Computer Science Department at The Johns Hopkins University for interdisciplinary research in robotics, image-processing, computer vision, modeling, and computer-integrated surgery. Specific research projects include: (a) segmentation, modeling, and characterization of complex tubular structures such as blood vessels and bronchial trees from 3D tomographic images; (b) accurate vision-based camera-to-model registration and navigation within modeled 3D structures; and (c) development of methods for combining numerical optimization, geometric modeling, path planning and uncertainty analysis, and interactive visualizations to help a human expert plan a complex 3D task for robotically-assisted execution. This research combines numerically intensive computation on 2D and 3D images and models with interactive visualization of models and intermediate computational results, using examples from biomedical modeling, using problems in biomedical imaging, endoscopy, and radiation therapy planning to provide motivation and focus. The provided equipment significantly promotes this research by permitting realistic experimental evaluation on full-scale image data sets and models of novel algorithms and methods in computer vision, modeling, computational steering, and human-machine partnerships.</data>

The three key areas for this research effort are rewrite operations, equational programming, and equational deduction, though the results will likely also be applicable to other areas such as (constraint) logic programming. Research on rewrite operations will focus on variants of pattern matching algorithms that are specifically tailored to lazy evaluation strategies for functional programming and to build the semantics of certain functions into the matching algorithms for equational deduction. The investigations in equational deduction will center on the PI&apos;s recently proposed basic completion method, in which no inferences are applied at those subexpressions in formulas that are built up from substitutions generated in previous inference steps. The equational programming component of the proposal will focus on the further development of Equals --- a fast parallel implementation of a lazy language and the Integral system which uses symbolic constraint solving techniques to glue together program analyses across different paradigms. ***</data>

This computing platform supports four experimental research projects in the area of high performance parallel and distributed systems. The first project investigates efficient communication primitives for cost-effective commodity computing and networking platforms. The objective is to enable important parallel computations to execute efficiently in this computing environment.

The objective is to extend the range of parallelizing compilers to include computations that manipulate complex pointer-based data structures. The third project investigates scheduling and run-time supporting techniques for irregular scientific computations. The objective is to understand how to map these computations efficiently onto a modern parallel computing environment consisting of commodity hardware components. The final project investigates issues in developing a scalable WWW server for digital library applications. The objective is to strengthen the server&apos;s processing capabilities to match huge expected increases in simultaneous access requests from the Internet.

      <data key="e_abstract">Korzennik, Sylvain 95-21777 Dr. Korzennik will analyze and interpret solar data from the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) in order to advance our understanding of the causes of the 11-year cycle of sunspots and solar magnetic activity. Decades of study of magnetic activity strongly suggest that the activity cycle is somehow caused by a dynamo process involving the interaction of rotation and convection in the interior. Unfortunately, detailed understanding of this process is frustrated by our inability to measure the rotation or convective flows deep within the Sun. Helioseismic data from the GONG will permit the study of rotational and convective flows at and beneath the solar surface, with velocity precision and spatial resolution sufficient to test theoretical models of solar magnetic field generation.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The investigators&apos; research in multiple reference point models of information petrieval (IR) has led to the development of a collection of visual information retrieval interfaces (VIRIs) embodying different approaches to visualizing similarity and semantic relations among documents. These VIRIs are intended to aid users in retrieval and organization of online information. VIRIs based on visualization of Boolean/set operations (BIRD), distance measures in a reduced space defined by reference points (GUIDO), similarity with respect to multiple reference points (VIBE), and similarity defined jointly by distance and angular separation (DARE) have been developed. User studies will be conducted with these VIRIs in order to: 1) improve usability of their interfaces, 2) investigate conceptual accessibility of different visualizations to potential user populations, and 3) evaluate utility of the VIRIs for prototypical information retrieval and organization tasks. These studies will provide the first systematic investigation of the usefulness of document space visualizations to expected user populations for a variety of information retrieval and organization tasks. The interface features enhancing VIRI usability, and information visualizations demonstrating usefulness are expected to augment hypertext as mechanisms for organizing and accessing online information.</data>

Meral Ozsoyoglu Case Western Reserve University Presentation Languages in Multimedia Databases Multimedia presentation refers to the concurrent presentation of multimedia data using monitors for text, video or still images, and speakers for audio. Each presentation contains multimedia segments retrieved from a database, and is constructed and played out by a presentation manager software. This research has three components. (a) A prototype system is developed to automate the assembly of presentations from multimedia databases for beginning computer users. The system is then revised and evaluated in different application domains. One example is a Course-Assistant software in education. (b) A presentation construction language for intermediate computer users is implemented and evaluated in different application domains. The language provides control on the number and contents of concurrent segments in a presentation, and has the ability to specify playout-time changes in a presentation, and communication and synchronization among multiple playout managers. (c) For advanced users, a presentation manipulation language is developed and evaluated. The development is carried out on multimedia personal computers with MPEG capture and playout capabilities and on workstations, acquired by the instrumentation grant. The development platforms are Windows NT and UNIX.</data>

Diagrams are fundamental to hardware design. Designers use them extensively to convey details, to express properties, and to reason informally about designs. Despite this, little attention has been paid to supporting diagrammatic reasoning in verification. As a result, a substantial gap exists between design practice and verification methodology that makes performing verification difficult for designers. The project aims to bridge this gap through a logic developed around common hardware representations. The logic has five syntactic representations: three diagrammatic and two sentential. The inference rules support reasoning with information from multiple representations, thereby providing formal support for how diagrammatic information is used in practice. The practical objective is to investigate whether this logic makes verification easier for designers. A verification tool based on the logic will be implemented and evaluated alongside existing methodologies by both novices and experienced practitioners. The main theoretical objective is to examine how diagrammatic information can help refine the current boundaries between automated and interactive verification methodologies. The integration of these approached will be an important feature of the tool ***</data>

The objectives of their research are to develop highly parallel branch-and-bound algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) and software for optimization computations on parallel computers. Branch-and-bound algorithms are used widely in solving combinatorial optimization problems that appear in a variety of applications like computer vision, robot motion planning, and integer programming and computer-aided design of very large scale integrated circuits. These problems take a long time to solve. The U.S. investigators propose to develop time and memory efficient techniques for solving these problems using parallel processing. The U.S. investigators bring to this research their expertise in parallel computing and techniques for solving COPs using distributed memory machines and workstation clusters. This is complemented by the French investigator&apos;s expertise in operations research and her work on branch-and-bound algorithms techniques suitable for shared-memory multiprocessors.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The research goal is to model the dynamic vibratory motion of the vocal folds using an interactive, three dimensional vocal fold model, whose parameters can be adjusted by the researcher to interactively test new hypotheses concerning voice production. The methodology includes spectral shaping and noise modeling of fricatives, plosives and affricatives as well as nonlinear dynamic modeling of vocal fold motion. A major motivation for this model is that imaging and other methods for measuring aspects of vocal fold vibratory motion are difficult tasks that involve probes inserted into the throat. The vocal fold model will be tested using an articulatory speech synthesizer developed by the author under previous NSF sponsorship. The significance of this interactive model is that its features and parameters can be modified and are related to physiological characteristics of the speech production process. Three applications for the research results are training aids for the hearing impaired, methods to improve the design of speech production systems for the vocally impaired, and improved speech coding based on articulatory movement.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Over the past decade, researchers have developed tools that offer automated support for applying formal methods to the design and analysis of concurrent software systems. In principle, these tools allow system designers to utilize formal system verification techniques without requiring them to know all the details of the underlying mathematical theories. In practice, however, the impact of the tools has been limited because of the relatively small scale of the problems they can handle and because of their lack of support for more traditional development methods for software, such as structured design techniques, simulation, and debugging. This research project aims at extending the applicability of existing automated formal techniques for concurrent systems to problems of real-life scale and complexity. The focus is on two broad issues: (1) increasing the efficiency and scalabity of existing approaches; and (2) enhancing the usability of existing techniques by integrating them with more traditional software development methods. More specifically, it seeks to develop advanced state-space management techniques for checking system specifications against logical properties expressed in the modal mu-calculus, and techniques for graphically conveying diagnostic information for systems that fail to meet their logical specifications. The impact of the research is being assessed by analyzing several real-life applications, such as sliding-window communications protocols and cache coherency protocols for distributed shared memory. This research builds on the investigators&apos; prior work on the Concurrency Factory, an integrated toolset for specification, simulation, verification, and implementation of concurrent systems. *** _</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">*** 9530666 Oviatt A foundation is provided by this research for the development of substantially more robust, flexible, accessible, and user-centered interfaces for multimodal/multimedia systems that incorporate human language technology. Specific objectives include: (1) modeling users&apos; adapted language during error resolution, and applying this information to the design of better error avoidance and resolution techniques, (2) examining the impact of different types and qualities of complex visual display on users&apos; linguistic input to interactive systems, and designing interfaces that effectively but transparently guide users&apos; input to match system processing capabilities, and (3) developing a refined metric of cognitive workload that can be applied to the design of well-integrated multimodal interfaces. To pursue these objectives, a rapid, semi-automatic simulation technique is being used that supports the collection of high-fidelity data during multimodal human-computer interaction. This research will significantly advance the empirical, theoretical, and applied foundations needed for the design of multimodal interfaces, and will be critical to establishing usable systems that can succeed in actual field settings. In particular, it can have a major impact on improving the commercial viability of next-generation communications devices and mobile technology for a wide range of applications. ***</data>

      <data key="e_title">Niche Conservatism: A Population Dynamic Perspective</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9528602 Holt As the tide of environmental change rises inexorably around us, it is becoming increasingly urgent to understand the capacity of species to respond. An inspection of the fossil record suggests that species vary widely in their abilities to adapt to changed circumstances. Some species seem to adapt very readily to change, whereas others are quite conservative in their basic &quot;ecological niches&quot; (i.e., the environmental conditions in which populations of a species can persist without repeated immigration or introductions of new individuals from external sources). The aim of this research project is to develop a conceptual framework for interpreting both conservatism and rapid change in species&apos; niches, combining a contemporary understanding of genetic change in populations with an understanding of the determinants of change in population size. The basic approach taken is to use mathematical and computer analyses which combine ecology (controls on population size) and genetics (controls on the genetic makeup of populations) to examine how species respond both genetically and numerically to different kinds of variation in their environments. For example, climate change can lead to either an altered environment across the entire range of a species, or possibly just part of its range, in a short period of time. We thus consider a range of scenarios that incorporate both environmental change in time and variations across geographic locations. Findings from this research will address significant fundamental problems in biology--why some species adapt readily and others more slowly (or not at all) in the face of environmental change. The research has implications for important applied problems, such as the design of conservation plans and understanding genetic responses of pest organisms to control programs.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Data Acquisition Systems with User Configurable Hardware</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project develops a new class of data acquisition systems with user configurable hardware. The primary development effort is the creation of software tools which will enable scientists and engineers who are not skilled hardware designers to utilize such systems. Some of the primary research issues are the development of techniques for specifying and analyzing timing behavior between fixed and configurable hardware and the development of techniques for designing robust interfaces. A typical application of this work is a reconfigurable data acquisition card consisting of a fixed analog section and a configurable digital section built from one or more field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and static RAM chips. Existing data acquisition cards are generally used by scientists and engineers who are not skilled hardware designers; however, the currently available tools for FPGAs require significant digital design experience. For a reconfigurable data acquisition card to be useful, it is necessary that the configuration tools accept as input high level programming language which is accessible to a competent programmer. Any custom hardware necessary to interface the analog sections or host CPU must be provided in the form of libraries which can be conveniently linked to the user&apos;s code.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The purpose of this meeting is to stimulate interest in and enhance understanding of the technical aspects of computer algebra, by providing a way for those in the region who are active or interested in becoming more active in computer algebra to meet with each other in an inexpensive and easily accessible way. This meeting will be more informal than the annual ISSAC meetings, with ample time for unstructured interaction. Participation by the region&apos;s graduate students will be particularly encouraged through special invitation to contribute to the poster sessions, and through travel support. This meeting is well on its way to becoming a regular series for the region, with different academic and industrial institutions hosting the meeting in rotation. This year&apos;s meeting is the third in the series: the first meeting was held in 1994 at Drexel University in Philadelphia, and the second meeting in April 1995 at the University of Delaware. Both meetings were very successful, and at the business session conducted at the end of the Delaware meeting it was agreed to meet at IBM Research in 1996, the first industrial site of our series. The meetings have had the endorsement (without financial support) of ACM&apos;s Special Interest Group for Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (SIGSAM) and of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this project is to develop and apply scalable numerical methods and a software infrastructure for the first principles prediction of the properties of materials. These materials typically have complex structures and compositions, a large number of atoms (n&gt;100) and little or no symmetry. For many important examples reliable theoretical predictions are not possible using present day approaches. Here a new method is being tested; preliminary results show that it promises to remove a major roadblock to the wider application of first principle calculations to real materials, thereby greatly expanding the problems that can be treated. As part of the project this new method will be applied to an important problem, the oxidation of carbon based materials. The project builds on a novel computational approach to solving the LAD equations based on a parallel, real-space, adaptive multigrid eigenvalue solver. Unlike Fourier methods, this adaptive method locally refines the solution to capture the short length scales in the problem; for example, the short length in near oxygen region in the carbon oxygen system. The investigators&apos; preliminary calculations are currently limited to model problems with structures similar to the real materials Schrodinger eigenvalue equation. However, the new computational method shows promising improvements in convergence and efficiency over present algorithms. The purpose of this program is to enhance the proposed solver to enable application of an adaptive method to real materials.</data>

      <data key="e_title">An Integrated Framework for Mechanical Verification of Fault-Tolerant Systems</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Formal verification is a technique for reducing certain questions about the requirements, designs, or implementations of computer software and hardware to a mathematical form that can examined by methods having the character of calculation. Similar to the way in which questions about the properties of an aerofoil can be reduced to calculations that can be mechanized by computational fluid dynamics, mechanized formal verification uses automated theorem proving and related methods (e.g., model checking) to perform logical calculations about the properties of computer systems. Whereas testing can examine only some of the behaviors of a complex system, mechanized formal verification can examine all the behaviors of a model of the system (again, the situation is analogous to flight test vs. computational fluid dynamics). Using mechanized formal verification, suitably realistic models can provide strong evidence for the correctness of computer systems, and simplified models are often useful for detecting bugs that testing does not encounter. Mechanized formal verification is most effective when applied to the hardest and most critical elements of design. An area where it holds great promise is in the analysis of fault-tolerant systems, where the presence of faults can produce a complexity of behavior that defies other forms of analysis. The increased assurance provided by mechanized formal verification can be of particular value for fault- tolerant systems because these are generally found in applications that are critical to safety (such as aircraft and other vehicles) or national infrastructure (such as the telephone, power-distribution, and banking systems). The objectives of this research are to reduce mechanized formal verification of fault-tolerant distributed algorithms from tours-de- force to routine practice, and to develop a framework for mechanical verification of the architectures of complete fault-tolerant systems composed from such algorithms. Th e research focuses on developing systematic methods for the formal specification of classes of fault- tolerant algorithms, and mechanized strategies for their exploration and verification. These strategies will build on techniques that combine decision procedures and model checking within an interactive framework. The algorithms considered will include those for distributed consensus, synchronization, diagnosis, and group membership. The work is expected to yield improved understanding of the assumptions, constraints, and fault models underlying the algorithms studied, more refined arguments for their correctness, and coherent arguments for their synthesis into an overall architecture. In addition, the research is expected to yield new results in the construction and application of formal verification systems, and improved methods for the formal representation and analysis of fault- tolerant algorithms. ***</data>

The thrust of the research is to produce a generalized computer code that solves the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in two dimensions on the structured or unstructured quadrilateral grids using a higher order Godunov type scheme. The code is to be developed so that it will accept different initial and boundary conditions to model different physical problems of interest to plasma physics and controlled fusion as well as to astrophysical problems. Scope: This award is to fund visits by the two U.S. P.I.&apos;s, as well as one of their graduate students at the U. of Michigan, to Marmara University, and the visit of the Turkish scientist and a graduate student to the University of Michigan. The project brings these very experienced scientists in the fields of MHD, fusion and computational fluid dynamics to collaborate on developing a new powerful two-dimensional computer code to solve MHD problems in various physical applications. The project also allows for the initiation of a long-term collaboration between the two teams at the two schools in the United States and Turkey. It also provides an international experience for a U.S. graduate student, by working at a dynamic foreign institute in Istanbul. Partial funding of this project is being provided by the Division of Mathematical Sciences. The project fits well with the objectives of the Division of International Programs.</data>

      <data key="e_title">CARD: Corpus Analysis Resources for Discourse</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This is a collaborative effort among three universities (Columbia, Rochester, and Pittsburgh) to construct, evaluate, and disseminate a package of Corpus Analysis Resources for Discourse (CARD). The goal is to provide the means for a large-scale, robust analysis of language use, both within and across distinct types of discourse corpora. The three components of CARD are a Discourse Annotation Language (DAL) to encode information pertaining to language use directly within discourse corpora; reliability measures of the degree of variability in DAL annotations; and a library of DAL-annotated corpora, varying in modality, number of participants, domain, and communicative task. DAL follows the Text Encoding Initiative guidelines and is implemented in Standard Generalized Markup Language to facilitate common authoring and editing utilities. DAL is a modular language with five layers of linguistic representation: morpho-syntactic, prosodic, anaphoric, lexical, and segmental.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">IRI-9522930 Tesar, Delbert University of Texas-Austin $60,000- 24 mos CONACyT: Advanced Communication Technology in Robotics and Flexible Manufacturing Cells This is the first year of a two-year standard award. The field of manufacturing is on the verge of a revolution in the level of intelligence which will become possible and necessary during the next decade. This award under the NSF/CONACyT Initiative funds a collaboration between robotics investigators at the University of Texas at Austin and researchers at the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM) laboratories at Cuernavaca and Mexico City to develop foundation technologies needed for high performance, reconfigurable, and fault tolerant robots and manufacturing cells for the next generation production facilities. The laboratory at Austin will concentrate on the foundation technologies for highly reliable, fault tolerant, and reconfigurable communications within production systems. This includes the creation of the best software structure and standardized reconfigurable interfaces at all connections in the system. The appropriate level of granularity, multiplexing, protocols, etc. will be developed to provide configuration management schemes to most rapidly and reliably avoid a fault in the data transfer including buffers to allow for transition time without loss of control information. The ITESM labs at Mexico City and Cuernavaca will focus on hardware and operational software for the manufacturing cells.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The primary objective of the project is to enhance and port a software simulation package, SIMARC, to a Sun workstation network. The purpose of the SIMARC package is to enable the user to quickly develop Modularly Configured Attached Processor (MCAP) architectures and simulate the execution of various algorithms on these architectures. The SIMARC package has already been developed at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) for IBM PC compatible computers. The simulator and assembler portions of SIMARC would be ported by a group at UTEP and the architecture editor portion would be ported by a group at the Instituto Technologio de Estudios Superiores Monterrey Campus Ciudad de Mexico. Also both groups would use the package to develop high-performance architectures for executing signal processing and communications algorithms. The principal result of the project would be a software package that could be used for the fast prototyping of customized attached processors designed to efficiently execute specified sets of algorithms. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project explores through several inter-related activities the uses and abuses of anonymous communications on the internet. The benefits and drawbacks of anonymous computer communication are just now beginning to be examined, an examination rendered more difficult by the fact that the value of anonymous communication in a non-networked environment is itself a matter of debate. Nevertheless, a growing number of computer and network professionals, lawyers, social scientists, and ethicists agree that anonymity is an important issue that needs to be addressed from a variety of perspectives. Building on an earlier project focusing on the ethical, legal, and technological aspects of computer and network use and abuse, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) plans to develop 1)criteria setting forth contexts in which anonymous communications are desirable (to be encouraged), permissible (to be tolerated), or undesirable (to be discouraged), and 2) preliminary guidelines for those situations where anonymity is to be either encouraged or tolerated. AAA will conduct several interrelated activities: 1) background information and guidance will be provided through commissioned papers on such topics as the individual and social uses and ramifications of anonymous communications, legal issues regarding anonymity, and the current and anticipated technical capabilities pertinent to anonymity on the net; 2) development of case studies based on individual experiences with anonymity; 3) convening of focus groups to frame issues for a two-day conference at which invited individuals from a variety of professional backgrounds and perspectives will discuss criteria and guidelines that can form the basis for normative and legal standards regarding anonymity. Results will be disseminated in a number of forms, including the World Wide Web page.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This award supports Professors Lane and Edith Hemaspaandra, of the University of Rochester and Le Moyne College, respectively, to collaborate in computer science with Professor Gerd Wechsung of the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Germany. Together they will study several topics of current interest in computational complexity theory These include (1) rigorous studies of the effect of query order on complexity (i.e., whether and when the order of access to multiple information sources matters) and (2) certificate complexity (calculating the conditions that control the size of classes of sets which always have acceptance certificates that can be easily computed.) The U.S. and German participants in this collaboration bring to bear complementary strengths in the creative theoretical aspects and the rigorous mathematical aspects of computational complexity. The joint effort of these talented and prolific researchers should produce significant contributions to the study of structural aspects of complexity theory. Results will have implications in many aspects of computer and information science.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This research explores the relationships between models used to refine the system design, to assess the real-time behavior of the system, and to assess the fault tolerance. these relationships are being combined to develop tools for system- level modeling with dependability analysis of the design. The approach builds on two recently developed tools, ADEPT (Advanced Design Environment Prototype Tool) and DREDD (Dependability and Risk Evaluation using Decision Diagrams). Advanced techniques for dependability analysis of embedded computer systems are being put into the ADEPT design environment. There, a dynamic fault tree model is automatically generated from the ADEPT system design model. The fault tree models uses a combination of Markov techniques, combinatorial approaches and binary decision diagrams. It can model permanent and transient hardware faults, unrelated and related software, automatic recovery and reconfiguration management, sequence dependencies and other dynamic behavior.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Recurrent Modeling</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Current fractal tools lack the level of control necessary to model specific natural structures. For example, many fractal models of trees have been constructed, but given a particular tree, it would be difficult to represent the tree&apos;s specific shape using current models of fractal modeling. The recurrent modeling project identifies three aspects to this problem, and attempts to solve each with several new fractal modeling tools. Objective I: Recurrent Model Representation. Recurrent modeling strives to elevate fractal representation to the level of sophistication that smooth surfaces enjoy in computer-aided geometric design by translating their classical self-referential representation into standard implicit and parametric forms. Recurrent modeling also attempts &quot;procedural geometric instancing,&quot; and enhancement of the classic object instancing paradigm that enables it to more efficiently represent the development fractal models currently specified by L-systems. Objective II: Interactive Recurrent Modeling. Recurrent modeling extends the tools of computer-aided geometric design to fractal geometry. A direct manipulation interface provides real time feedback in the fractal modeling process. The implicit formulation from the previous objective allows the application of standard blending formulations specifically designed for natural modeling. Extending constructive solid geometry to include fractal models supports the construction of complex shapes from primitives. Objective III: Automatic Recurrent Modeling. Recurrent modeling attacks the inverse problem of fractal geometry: &quot;find the parameters of a fractal model that approximates a given shape&quot; from the domain of model-based computer vision. The second PI is an NSF-supported model-based computer vision researcher. His unique perspective on this problem resulted in a new solution, called &quot;similarity hashing&quot;. Similarity hashing successfully detects self-similarity and returns the paramete rs of the selfsimilar model in initial tests. Recurrent modeling continues this research to develop an automated system for discovering selfaffinity in natural structures. The new tools recurrent modeling proposes would impact the fields of computer graphics and forest science. The new tools would represent highly detailed geometrics, such as a forest and crops. Such models would have applications in image synthesis, particularly in animation, virtual environments, physically- based modeling and remote sensing. As the smooth representations of computer-aided geometric design aid manufacturers, the efficient representations of detail proposed by recurrent modeling representations would aid the study of the environment. ***</data>

      <data key="e_title">An Integrated Method for Simultaneous Recognition and Segmentation of Deformable Objects</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This research is primarily aimed at robustly locating deformable structures/objects of approximately known shape from natural images. The problem of locating and recognizing underlying object structures in an image is of importance in many image analysis and computer vision applications including robot vision, pattern recognition and biomedical image processing. Algorithms that can reliably perform these basis tasks are at the core of a variety of systems that will permit humans to more effectively interact with pictorial data for the purposes of visualization, analysis, control or, as in the case of image database systems, retrieval of task-specific information within these applications areas. The robust identification and measurement of such structure is not always achievable using a single analysis technique that depends on a single image derived source of information. This is especially true when one is dealing with a wide range of images obtained under different conditions having different image content. The approach in this research project utilizes two different sources of image-derived information: 1.) gray-level gradients and ii.) homogeneity of intensity or texture elements, etc., as well as model-based information (i.e approximate object shape). Furthermore, two different processing methods are combined in this approach, in order to integrate the above-mentioned information sources: a) regionbased methods, which are primarily based on homogeneity properties and b.) boundary methods which capitalize on both gradient (imagederived) and shape (model based) properties. A game theoretic framework will be used, where, unlike the global objective approach which is widely used as an integration method in computer vision, the modularity of the underlying objectives are retained. The integration problem is then framed as a family of coupled and coex isting objectives whereby the output of one module depends upon the previous outputs of the other modules. This effort will build on initial work which has been able to locate structure in two dimensional images. It will also extend the concept to analyzing three dimensional image data. Both theoretical and experimental investigations will be carried out regarding the applicability and the limits of the approach.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This is a one-year regular grant that investigates mathematical model-based methods for coordination in intelligent agent societies. The research addresses how to construct an general model of coordination that is based on a identification of a set of state variables that characterize relevant aspects of agent behavior in an agent society. Coordination is defined as the management of dependencies among activities, following a widely used definition of coordination. The problem of coordination is then the problem of exerting control over these dependencies. The research aims to discover logical orderings of state variables based on dependencies, and thus to develop mathematical models of coordination strategies. Once coordination and control relationships are known, coordination problems can be treated using constraint satisfaction, constraint-propagation, ad optimization approaches. The mathematical models will be further explored and validated through simulation.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Multimedia presentation refers to the concurrent presentation of multimedia data using monitors for text, video or still images, and speakers for audio. Each presentation contains multimedia segments retrieved from a database and is constructed and played out by a presentation manager software. For novice users of multimedia databases, general-purpose techniques and methodologies are developed for automated assembly of semantically coherent presentations from multimedia databases. These techniques are extended into automated assembly of presentations from electronic books and electronic classroom lectures and notes. For intermediate users, a graphical interface is developed for constructing concurrent presentations. Such an interface (i) provides control on the number and contents of concurrent presentation streams, (ii) has the ability to specify dynamic (i.e., playout-time) changes in a presentation order, and (iii) allows playout-time communication and synchronization among multiple concurrent presentation streams. For advanced users, graph-based query and update languages for advanced users, tailored specifically for retrieving and manipulating presentation objects, are developed. A multimedia database system is developed, populated, and experimentally evaluated. The system has an Automated-Presentation-Assembler, a graphical interface for presentation manipulation, and a presentation query and manipulation language. The system will contribute to our understanding of software tools for using digital libraries.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This award supports Professor Donald Loveland and Assistant Professor Owen Astrachan of Duke University to collaborate in computer science research with Professor Eike Jessen and others of the Computer Architecture Department of the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. They are studying the Model Elimination proof procedure, a general-purpose theorem-proving technique of interest to both research groups. The procedure is derived from the logic programming language Prolog, and can use the sophisticated implementation architecture developed for Prolog. There is a significant amoung of research being performed on Model Elimination in Germany as part of a five year multi-university research program on deduction that is lead by the TUM group. A fundamental issue being studied by both the German and US groups is the intelligent use of lemmas that are automatically generated by the Model Elimination system for use in accelerating the subsequent proof finding. Significant theorems have been proven using this technique enhanced with the lemma device where no solutions would have been possible without the lemma device. Therefore the development of good lemma selection techniques would be particularly valuable in this area of computer science. The collaborating Duke and TUM research groups have experience respectively with global and local lemma techniques. These are quite different approaches, and combining them is expected to lead to enhancements of the lemma techniques which will expand the usefulness of the Model Elimination procedure for proving more complex theorems such as those in the `grand challenge` class. The U.S. group will also benefit from interactions with other participants in the German national program from the University of Koblenz and the Humboldt University in Berlin.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Distributed Resource Management in Workstation and PC Clusters</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Advances in network and processor technology are greatly changing the communication and computational power of local-area clusters of workstations and personal computers. In particular, the replacement of Ethernets by newer switched network technologies, which provide both higher throughput and lower latency, presents an opportunity for operating systems to better use network resources. This research seeks to improve the performance of applications through distributed (cluster-wide) resource management. The project will develop algorithms that permit the effective sharing of all network resources: processors, network, memory, and disk storage. For example, programs on heavily- loaded nodes can use available memory on idle nodes for both file system and virtual memory backing store, rather than disk, thereby reducing the data latency on access to that data. As another example, applications may migrate to nodes that provide either a better processing environment or a better memory environment for their execution. A key issue in developing algorithms for such closely-coupled system is finding the right balance in order to optimize system-wide performance while minimizing any degradation of performance on individual systems as a result of network-wide resource sharing. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Very large information systems embody invisible values, embedded in layers of infrastructure, that impact on people&apos;s lives yet are often inaccessible to public debate. This project analyzes two such infrastructural tools, seeking to understand their politics, values, and how they tie together infrastructure, work and knowledge. In order to understand how and where values are embedded into these systems, the investigators will conduct systematic comparisons. Primarily, they will examine the design, development and use of two classification systems, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC). The first is about one hundred years old, while the second originated only 20 some years ago. For comparative purposes and depth of analysis, the team will look at similar developments in library and racial classification schemes. Routine, even boring aspects of information encoding may have important public and scientific consequences that can only be identified by careful attention to these procedures and their outcomes. The investigators draw empirical material from several sources. They have collected archival material on the ICD from WHO and UN archives and secondary material from WHO and USPHS documents. For NIC, they have been conducting an ongoing ethnographic investigation with its designers and developers, nursing researchers at the University of Iowa. They have collected and archived interview and fieldnote transcripts and electronic bulletin board material. This research will allow them to conplete data collection and analysis and conduct systematic comparisons. Results will include a monograph as well as articles and presentations to audiences in science studies, library and information science, nursing and informatics.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Weighted Myriad Filters and Their Applications in Communications</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Linear Filtering theory has been largely motivated by the characteristics of Gaussian random processes. In the same manner, research in myriad filtering theory is motivated by the statistical properties of alpha-stable processes which describe an important class of processes, impulsive in nature, that obey a Generalized Central Limit Theorem; thus these processes can arise in practice as a result of physical principles. The foundation of myriad filtering algorithms lies in the definition of the sample myriad as the location estimate of a class of alpha-stable distributions. The main goals of this research are: (1) To study the theoretical properties of the sample myriad and to exploit its geometrical structure for the development of efficient computational algorithms. (2) To solve the optimal &quot;weighted myriad&quot; filtering problem - the problem analogous to the design of the optimal FIR (Wiener) filter and the optimal weighted median filter. (3) To develop adaptive filtering algorithms for the simple design of weighted myriad filters for applications where the statistical characteristics of the underlying signals may be unknown or varying. (4) To extend the filter formulation to the case where the signals are complex or multivariate, providing us with the tools needed to develop robust CDMA multiple access detectors. This work can have a significant impact on applications requiring robust estimation and filtering. This is particularly the case in mobile and personal communication systems, to be deployed in the near future, where the underlying statistics of the noise and interferences closely follow the models used in this research rather that the traditional models used in practice today. The results of this research can also be applied to a wide range of problems including remote sensing imaging of the environment and non-destructive evaluation of materials.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9632801 Koditschek This proposal describes an approach to the control of xerographic printing that, if successful, promises to advance the state of the art in the industry, help lead Xerox Corporation into a $80B new market, and considerably enlarge the academic community&apos;s experience with application of robust, nonlinear, and intelligent controls techniques in competitive, fast moving consumer markets. The chief technical objective is a dramatic improvement in the process stability of dry powder color xerography. The long term goal is to demonstrate this level of stability in all relevant environmental zones (temperature, relative humidity), a variety of paper types and colors, and over a number of machines. A second contribution will be the development of a new controls oriented design support methodology. The approach to this problem will be driven by a &quot;problem solving&quot; focus (rather than a &quot;theory driven focus&quot;) to creatively combine the strengths of the researchers at the Wilson Research Center with the academic researchers at the University of Michigan. Preliminary discussions suggest a hierarchical controller whose lower level specifies process parameters using robust (nonadaptive) nonlinear controller techniques with a higher level specification of the product parameters using model driven adaptive or possibly learning techniques. The control algorithms and architectures developed in this project will be assessed for product-worthiness with respect to the standard Xerox Field Readiness Determination Testing procedures. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The project is to pursue ongoing investigations into core areas of computational geometry, in particular, cell decomposition, mesh generation, multidimensional searching, and geometric optimization. The research will span the spectrum from the theoretical (e.g., lower bounds, geometric sampling techniques, derandomization) to the practical (implementation and distribution of geometric software). Progress in the field has been hampered by the difficulty in testing out new geometric ideas on a computer. As a result, experimentation has often taken a backseat to theoretical research. Essential to this project is the building of software tools (e.g., algorithm animation, visual debugging, test data generation) that facilitate and encourage the use of experimentation. ***</data>

      <data key="e_title">The Topological Approach to Asynchronous Computability</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The choice of primitive coordination operations, whether reading and writing a shared memory, message-passing, or more complex operations, has become a crucial design issue. To make such choices, one must analyze the behavior of multi- process executions, reasoning about the multitude of possible combinations of concurrent operations. This is an unusually delicate and laborious task. The goal of this research is to replace this need to argue about concurrent executions with combinatorial conditions on the geometric representation of problems. This should allow researchers and designers, instead of analyzing behaviors, to apply powerful mathematical tools to recognize when certain protocols are impossible, to evaluate the power of alternative synchronization primitives, or to make explicit the assumptions needed to make a given problem solvable. This project pursues the problem of characterizing and classifying the power of synchronization primitives in different models. Prior research has developed powerful new tools based on classical topology for analyzing fault- tolerant concurrent alogrithms and data structures in a variety of models and architectures. This research has shown that a large class of synchronization problems can be associated with a high-dimensional geometric structure called a simplicial complex, and that the computational complexity of solving the problem using a given underlying architecture is captured by certain topological properties of the complex. These properties have been used to give a complete characterization of the synchronization problems solvable in asynchronous read/write memory, and to provide impossiblity results and lower bounds for several known open problems in both the asynchronous model and in the synchronous message-passing model. These techniques are being applied toward a comprehensive theory of multiprocessor synchronization. ***</data>

      <data key="e_title">Programming-Language Structures for Representing and Optimizing Operating-System Resources</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This research project seeks to demonstrate that fundamental operating system services and resources can and should be represented directly in the natural linguistic structures of advanced programming languages. A component of this effort is to develop aggressive optimisation strategies making this modelling practical and efficient. The central question underlying the research is: how can the benefits of advanced programming languages be brought to bear upon current systems-programming practice? Modern computer applications are most commonly written in C, a language well- known for its lack of support for writing modular, robust programs. C has no module system, allows dangerous &quot;casting&quot; of data types, violates abstraction barriers, provides no garbage- collection support for automatic storage management, has no concurrency operators, and generally exposes the details of the underlying machine to the programmer. It is not defined in terms of a mathematically sound underlying semantics. As a result, modern software is fragile, error-prone, and difficult to build, maintain or reuse. Modern programming languages, such as the ML family of languages, provide much more support to the programmer for writing large, robust programs. Unfortunately, these languages are not yet practical tools for implementing real-world systems software. In practice, programs written in these languages are slow, use large amounts of memory, and have awkward interfaces to OS services. Providing access from programs written in these languages to the machine resources, in ways that are natural to the language, should help to address these shortcomings. This research enables new optimisations and makes available new models to the programmer, allowing systems programs to be written that exploit the expressive power of advanced programming languages. A service kernel provides access to the underlying machine resources in a way that is tightly integrated, both in architecture and in implem entation, with advanced languages. The research issue is to investigate the architecture of an operating system that is symbiotic, not with C, but with a modern programming language, and to develop technologies for exploiting the tight integration of the OS and the compiler to provide efficient, high-level services. The kernel is being developed in ML, on two hardware platforms: a bare Intel PC system, and a wireless, mobile &quot;personal digital assistant&quot; with limited on-board resources. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) communications systems are limited by multiple access interference (MAI). Multiuser detection accomplishes MAI cancellation by exploiting the knowledge of all users&apos; signatures. Due to the complexity of the optimum multiuser detector, various sub-optimum detector structures have been considered. In this study a novel structure termed DC^3 for adaptive multiuser detection of asynchronous users, which is simple in that it does not require duplication of the hardware, as optimum detectors require. To handle errors in relative delay estimation, a special adaptive decorrelator called the &apos;bootstrap decorrelator&apos; is utilized. Performance of the bootstrap decorrelator under different fading environments with different unknown delays is analyzed and convergence and stability questions are treated. Performance of the DC^3 receiver as a whole is also studied, in a realistic communications environment.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The proposed study is concerned with a one-step direct process to fabricate three-dimensional parts using a laser beam. This process is referred to as the Laser-Aided Direct Rapid Prototyping (LADRP). Laser light can melt and/or vaporize virtually any material and laser tooling leads to the unification of various conventional tools because a laser beam can be used to carry out many different machining operations such as cutting, drilling, welding and milling. Such process integration is very important for the rapid production of three- dimensional parts directly in near net shape. The success of the proposed rapid prototyping process depends on the development of systematic design methodologies and developing suitable digital interfaces between design and manufacturing. The proposed research will carry out experimental studies and develop mathematical models for the LADRP process, and will develop design rule characterization of the LADRP process so that lower- level CAD tools for process planning simulation and verification may be implemented. A layered description language will be developed that can generate the slices of 2.5 D layers for the part from an input file specified in some higher level description language such as the STL or ACIS format.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">It is proposed to develop a simple and clear language for use as a digital interface in Solid Free-Form Fabrication. This language is called &quot;SIF&quot; for &quot;Solid Interchange Format&quot; inspired by CIF, the Caltech Intermediate Form for LSI layout description. The role of SIF would be to describe the ideal solid part desired, in a fabrication-process-independent way. It is further proposed to create a foundation for some of the key tools needed with such an exchange language, in particular, a robust slicing tool to create 2.5D layers needed for process planning, as well as checker programs that will verify that the shape specified in the SIF file is indeed a closed solid, has the required topological and geometric properties, and specifies only realizable features containing certain minimum feature sizes and separations. Finally, it is proposed to develop test structures of various kinds that will test the robustness of analysis and conversion tools working from SIF input for different SFF fabrication processes and to monitor the quality of individual production runs.</data>

To support these applications, the machine must present a programmable interface (i.e. efficient shared address spaces and data movement) and scaleable high performance. This project will study a flexible machine architecture that recognizes these technological realities and not only supports advanced software structures, but exploits them to configure its programmable hardware, adapting itself to the application. The programming flexibility can provide a wide range of convenient interfaces, ranging from uniform cache-coherent shared memory, to clusters of smaller shared memory systems, to fully distributed memory. In addition to a range of interfaces, this flexible machine can customize both operations and protocols, exploiting appropriate mechanisms and policies to minimize the critical performance aspect--communication--at all levels of the system. This machine design leverages the wealth of research into optimal architectural mechanisms, customizable cache-coherence, as well as technological advances in interprocedural analysis, programmable hardware, and hardware synthesis technology, to achieve general-purpose high performance.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9633299 Hiromoto, Robert Boppana, Rajendra University of Texas - San Antonio CISE Minority Institutions Infrastructure: Building an Academic Pipeline for Minority Scholars This project builds a pipeline of minority students, focusing on the retention of qualified undergraduate and graduate students by appropriate financial support and mentoring activities. The goal is to involve students directly in ongoing faculty research projects and thus prepare them for graduate studies and research programs. Graduate minority students involved in the program will help faculty in mentoring undergraduates, in addition to their own studies and research obligations. The project encompasses two main thrust designed to improve the pipeline of minority students prepared for graduate programs. The first goal is to aggressively recruit and develop minority students interested in computer science by providing preparatory training, tutoring, and mentoring at the pre-college and lower-division undergraduate levels. The second goal is to provide upper-division and graduate students with funding support and increased involvement in faculty research in order to improve minority retention and graduate enrollment. Students will be involved in faculty research within five important areas: 1) parallel and distributed algorithm design for applications in high-performance scientific computing 2) software visualization, and program execution monitoring; 3) parallel compiler technology; 4) network routing and scheduling algorithms; 5) parallel and distributed simulation techniques.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Intelligent Information Gathering Using Decision Models</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">To investigate coordinated information gathering. The vast amount of information available today on the National Information Infrastructure has a great potential to improve the quality of decisions and the productivity of consumers of this information. Rapid expansion of the amount of available information and the number of sources is expected over the next 5-10 years. Improved information retrieval and information extraction technologies will become available. The large number of information sources that are currently emerging and their different levels of accessibility, reliability, and associated costs present a complex information gathering coordination problem that a human decisionmaker cannot possibly solve without high-level filtering of information. To be able to exploit the great potential of the NII we propose to develop the next logical step in automation of information gathering tasks: to organize information gathering activity based on its marginal contribution to the quality of the user&apos;s decision or task. This approach emphasizes the fact that information gathering is an intermediate step of a decisionmaking process. This research will provide a system with an explicit representation of the user&apos;s decision model, so that information gathering activity can be organized on the basis of its effect on the quality of the decision. To automate the information gathering planning task, the research will investigate an innovative extension to the standard value-of-information theory, that addresses the problems of information reliability, retrieval costs, real-time operation, and uncertainty. When operating under resource constraints (related to the cost of communication and database access, limited computation power, and limited amount of time) this approach should achieve a significant performance improvement over current techniques</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Many large corporations find themselves with a massive legacy database problem. Their data is distributed across many semantically related databases that are physically and logically disjoint. Until now, there have been two primary approaches for interconnecting heterogeneous database systems: (a) point solutions, in which software systems supporting focused interconnections between databases are constructed on an as-needed and ad hoc basis; and (b) global solutions, in which a common, logical database is created that encompasses a very large number of databases. (A variation of the latter is the federated approach, which involves a global federation manager that controls all interaction between the component databases.) The Diplomat project chooses a middle ground between these two extremes, and provides technology to support multiple loose database interconnections called `alliances`. The framework also provides mechanisms to enforce consistency between individual databases, and across alliances. The project draws on existing research on view specification, inter-database constraints, and information flow. This research serves as a proof of concept that maintainers of large business applications (such as banking, insurance, and telecommunications) can integrate multiple, heterogeneous, legacy database systems in a cost-effective, evolvable fashion.</data>

University of Virginia $49,996 - 12 mos SGER: Discovery Driven Manipulation of NonRigid Objects: Representation, Sensing and Planning This award, in the SGER mode, funds an initial exploration of machine discovery of motor coordination skills through sensory input. Recent psychophysical studies have revealed that humans can discover proper motor coordination skills through sensory input for tasks in which they have had no previous experience. The PIs are currently developing a spatial Jacobian-based framework for the design of robotic, nonrigid object manipulation strategies which emulate this human ability. Unlike existing algorithms, the strategies derived using this framework do not require the use of a priori deformation models since the necessary object parameters are learned during the process. Since the spatial Jacobians of an object are spatially dependent,the critical obstacle in the framework&apos;s continued development is determining the amount of information which must be recovered in the learning or discovery phase of the algorithms for accurate reconfiguration. For general flexible objects, the spatial Jacobian sets will be quite large and not efficiently learnable. Thus, in this preliminary research we will determine what subsets of spatial Jacobians must be obtained by the process to move the object from an initial state to a final state within an acceptable positional error. An experimental investigation will also determine the possibility of creating a set of canonical shapes to reduce the configuration space size as well.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Supporting Multiple Time Granularities in Query Evaluation and Data Mining</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The objective of this project is to provide a flexible framework for supporting multiple time granularities. The targeted use of the framework is for automatic evaluation of user queries and for discovering temporal patterns (i.e., data mining) in an environment where either the user queries or temporal patterns involve granularities that do not match the granularity of the stored data. The basic idea is to add the necessary functionalities so that the database system is able to understand and reason about information involving multiple time granularities. Algorithms for efficiently evaluating user queries and discovering temporal patterns will also be investigated, and an experimental prototype will be built. The impact of this research should be twofold: Firstly, the proposed framework should provide the basic tools for database systems to support flexible user queries, which would free users from the unnecessary tasks of writing complex queries or changing their pattern descriptions to fit the specific granularity used to store temporal data in the database. Secondly, the optimization techniques explored should provide strategies and algorithms for efficient evaluations of queries and discovery of temporal patterns. The proposed experimental work should provide insights into the subject and into the practicality of the proposed theory as well as methods.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Robust micromanipulation strategies are needed in order to overcome a potential technology barrier to the commercial development of complex microelectromechanical (MEMS) devics. Development of robust strategies requires an investigation into two critical issues not applicable to the traditional macro manipulation domain. These issues include the much higher relative positioning accuracy required, and the vastly different mechanics of manipulation. Both of these differences highlight the need for micromanipulation strategies that are guided by realtime sensor feedback. Initial experimental results indicate that feedback from high resolution optical systems with controllable intrinsic and extrinsic parameters in useful for manipulation over a broad range of micromanipulation tasks. This research theoretically and experimentally investigates sensor-based micromanipulation strategies that account for the different mechanics that govern object interactions on a micron scale. A critical aspect of the approach entails the use of realtime vision feedback from active optical systems to correct for micromanipulation mechanics that are often difficult to model precisely. In addition, various micro- grippers will be designed and analyzed, and promising designs will be micromachined and tested. This research will result in experimental and theoretical analyses that will illuminate the similarities and differences between sensor-based manipulation in macro and micro domains. The realization of successful micromanipulation strategies will aid in the development of automatic assembly machines for assembling and packaging future MEMS devices that require increasingly complex assembly strategies.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9634425 Long, Tim Sitaraman, Murali Ohio State University/West Virginia University CISE Educational Innovation: Development and Dissemination of a New Undergraduate Course Sequence in Software Design and Development This CISE Educational Innovation award supports the integration of research into the undergraduate curriculum through the development and dissemination of a new sequence in software design and development. The project is a joint effort between Ohio State University and West Virginia University, with OSU as the lead institution. The project involves the design, development, installation, and evaluation of an innovative three-quarter sequence in software design and development. The sequence is integrated and unified in its philosophical and technical bases. A major part of the effort includes the development of a software composition workbench consisting of an integrated set of software tools. The workbench will be capable of guiding students and software developers in their application of the methodologies taught in the course sequence and it will instill in software developers a particular mental model of software and how to construct it. Dissemination will be facilitated through training workshops for visiting faculty from a number of other institutions. The total project is supported in part also by the Fund for Improvement of Secondary Education (FIPSE) in the Department of Education.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The research focuses on developing millimeter-scale robotic tools with force feedback and tele-taction for performing tissue manipulation for minimally invasive remote surgery. Key elements of the project are: (1) prototyping of millimeter-scale robotic hands for teleoperation in minimally invasive procedures; (2) modeling and manipulation of compliant tissue; and (3) millimeter scale teletaction. The research program will be carried out on a telesurgical workstation incorporating millimeter-scale robots equipped with force and tactile sensing, larger positioning robots for holding the instruments, and a surgical interface including a bi-manual surgical master with tactile displays and force feedback . For the purposes of training and procedure rehearsal, the surgeon will be able to try out his/her actions on the surgical master using the simulator before implementation. In the first year of the project, surgical procedures like blunt dissection, catheterization, suturing and anastomosis will be explored. In the second year the system prototypes will be tested on procedures such as dissection of the peritoneum and suturing of ex-vivo stomach tissue. In the third year, a complex procedure, known as Nissen undoplication to control stomach reflux, will be tried as proof of the entire system.</data>

      <data key="e_title">A Rational Approximation Method for Efficient Calculation of QoS measures in High Speed Networks</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Coming Broadband Integrated Services Digital Networks (B-ISDNs) will be required to carry a broad range of traffic classes ranging from bursty, variable-rate sources, such as voice and variable-rate coded video, to smooth constant bit rate sources. Moreover, these networks will have to do so while providing a guaranteed quality-of-service (QoS) to these traffic classes. The problem of characterizing the performance of such networks is thus particularly important since this must be done, not only during the network design (in an off-line manner) but also for on-line control purposes such as call admission control. In this proposal we describe a novel technique for evaluating network performance based on the use of Global Rational Approximations (GRA) which has the potential of providing accurate estimates for a variety of performance measures such as packet loss probability in a wide variety of network settings. We outline research on GRAs whose aim is to develop a solid theoretical foundation on which the proposed algorithms can rest and to develop practical techniques for estimating network performance both during the design phase and in a real-time setting. Specifically, we propose to develop a complete theoretical foundation on which to develop algorithms for obtaining accurate global rational approximations for a variety of quality-of-service (QoS) metrics such as packet loss probability and probability that packet delay exceeds a particular value and to develop practical algorithms which can be used to evaluate large B ISDNs.</data>

The consequence of such an approach is that each robot can be made much simpler, smaller, and less expensive, since requirements for on-board sensing, control, and intelligence are reduced or even eliminated. Human capability for supervising and controlling multiple robots may also be augmented by this approach. The issues to be studied concern tradeoffs in control (bandwidth, accuracy, and channel capacity); relations between numbers of controllable robots and task suitability; and representation for control.</data>

      <data key="e_title">A Formal Approach for a Specification-Based Software Architecture of Real-Time Systems</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Real-time systems are becoming increasingly important to everyday life. Examples include command and control systems, process control systems, telecommunication systems, patient monitoring systems, flight control systems, robotics, avionics systems, and so on. With increasing computing power and high demand for multimedia applications, larger and more complex real-time systems are being continuously developed. However, the development of real-time systems is difficult and takes longer time than the development of a system without real-time constraints, and a significant portion of the entire effort remains devoted to the maintenance activities of the software life cycle. The concept of software architecture has recently emerged as a new way to improve our ability to effectively construct large- scale software systems. In spite of many attempts to develop architecture specification languages, this area still lacks a solid formal foundation. Without a solid foundation, it is difficult to develop and apply rigorous analysis methods to assure the correctness of real-time software systems as well as to analyze the impacts of changes on various system properties such as safety, consistency, and reliability. This research seeks to develop a formal foundation for an architecture specification language using the integration of non-monotonic logic and temporal logic. The syntax of the language is based on the concepts of object, frames and production rules. This allows developers to easily describe the attributes and constraints of each software component, and also the hierarchical relations among the software components in the software architecture. The goal is to localize changes to software components in the low- level architecture specification and avoid modifying the high- level architecture specification. The semantics of multiple inheritance and exception handling will be established using a non-monotonic logic. Based on the formal foundation of the architec ture specification language, it is expected that new possiblities will exist for analyzing software properties such as liveness, safety, consistency, and temporal constraints. This foundation is also expected to provide a basis for analyzing the impact of changes to a real-time software system. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The objective of this project is to develop an object-based framework for synchronization and interprocess communication in real-time computer systems. This framework will integrate work on scheduling theory with work on delay-resilient shared objects. The term ``scheduling&apos;&apos; refers to the problem of sequencing tasks on a shared execution unit such that it is possible to determine a priori if the timing requirements of tasks are respected. A variety of scheduling policies will be considered in this project, spanning the spectrum from hard to soft real-time systems. By focusing on delay-resilient shared objects, this project represents a significant point of departure from past work on real-time synchronization. Delay-resilient objects are distinguished by the fact that they are not locked. The notion of a delay-resilient shared object builds upon recent promising work on wait-free and lock-free synchronization in shared-memory multiprocessors. Although such work has been ongoing for several years, this project represents the first comprehensive effort to integrate such objects within an object-sharing framework for real-time computing. From a real-time perspective, the key advantage of delay-resilient objects is that they do not give rise to priority inversions. Traditional object-sharing approaches for real-time systems rely on significant operating system support to deal with this problem. The proposed approach does not require such support, and thus entails lower synchronization overhead than traditional approaches. Another advantage of the proposed approach is that it can be applied across a variety of diverse platforms. Target platforms for this project include uniprocessors, shared-memory and message-passing multiprocessors, and workstation clusters. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The main objective of this proposal is to develop an integrated approach for increasing the dependability of parallel computers. For detection and diagnosis of hardware faults at the local (node) level, this approach will combine off-line built-in self testing, on-line concurrent checking, and software techniques implementing path and algorithmic-based checks. The aim of this proposal is to develop a systematic method for generating and placing checks into the implementation of an application. For automating the verification process and placement of checks in programs, an interactive tool, VERIFY, will be developed. For estimating the coverage factor provided by these techniques, a software fault-injection tool will be created. Efficient and fast reconfiguration algorithms will be developed for avoiding single and multiple faulty nodes and links. A user transparent software layer will be created for implementing the proposed algorithms. This will be written on top of the existing system software that residents in every node of parallel computing systems. The Software Object-Oriented Fault-Injection Tool (SOFIT) will be ported on the nCUBE and Tandem SeverNet. The recovery time overhead will be estimated in the presence of single and multiple faults injected by SOFIT into the nodes and links of the nCUBE and SeverNet when programs are being executed. A dependability evaluation study will be performed. The objective of this research is to show that this integrated approach can be used successfully for improving the reliability of the nCUBE and SeverNet by an order of magnitude.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Semantic Foundations for Composition and Interoperation of Open Systems</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The objective of this research is to develop a semantic foundation for semantic composition and interoperation of heterogeneous components of open systems. Composition and interoperation occur at many levels (requirements, specification, code, executables) and along multiple dimensions (functionality, reliability, security, availability). Relations among the various levels and dimensions must be preserved. Existing work on composition and interoperation has largely focused on syntactic structure. It is essential to develop a semantic basis in order to provide for safe, secure, and meaningful combinations. Semantic structuring of complex systems should provide a firm basis for determining what parts are interchangeable under given conditions, and to predict effects of changes: of components on the whole, and of system requirements on requirements for the parts. There is a wide range of applications where such a semantic foundation for interoperation can be of value. It is especially important in applications that combine components from diverse domains such as: data bases, spread sheets, knowledge bases, multi-media, mobile-agents, control theory, or event-based simulations. Metalogical methods from the theory of general logics, and associated techniques of mappings in and across formalisms, are used to achieve formalism-independent semantics for system composition. This supports the multi-dimensionality of a system&apos;s levels of description and formalization. Techniques from the theory of Open Mechanized Reasoning Systems (OMRS) as well as work on the formal semantics of actor systems are used to study interoperation aspects. Reflective techniques, particularly reflective logics and multi-model systems are employed extensively. This research is expected to lead to a new technology for composition, interoperation and dynamic evolution of software systems. It seeks to treat interoperability at many levels and along many dimensions: components, languages, speci fications, formalisms/logics, and tools. This provides the capacity to move in a mathematically rigorous way across the different formalizations of a system, and to use the different tools supporting these formalizations in a rigorously integrated way. The research is based on two key technical ideas: module calculi (for integration) and open multi-model systems (for interoperation). The module calculus is formalism-independent, and is intended to have powerful new operations such as generalization. Open multi-model systems formalize the multidimensional aspects of independent interoperating parts. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The efficient use of bandwidth for multimedia information transmission depends on the efficient use of imperfect channels, such as coaxial cables and optical fibers. This means redundant information must be removed and what remains must be coded for reliable transmission. This research is addressing the problems of redundancy removal (source coding) from the point of view of multichannel filterbanks; it is also addressing the problem of efficiently implementing filterbanks in digital electronics. Specifically, we are studying applications of undersampling operators, oversampling operators, and tight frames to source coding, channel coding and halftoning. The aim of this research is to develop efficient state variable realizations for tight frames and related maps, and to determine the computational complexity and performance characteristics of these realizations. Of particular interest are sum of all-pass realizations for multichannel filterbanks. The results will produce insights and design rules for implementing source coders and channel coders in state variable filterbanks that have good numerical properties.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The most natural means of human communication is multimodal, involving a mixture of speech, hand and body movement, facial expression, and eye motion. A multimodal framework is developed where several interaction modes are explored as a means of manipulating a 3D virtual display. The main focus of this project is exploring the use of free hand gestures for manipulating virtual objects in an effort to advance the goal of developing the fundamental theory behind hand gestures as a way of manipulating graphical objects together with speech, gaze direction, scene content, and graphical feedback. Existing multi-user virtual reality setups are used as experimental testbeds for validating the usefulness of methodologies for building useful multimodal human-computer interfaces for virtual reality. Since the development of natural human-computer interaction techniques are perceived to be a major hurdle in a greater impact of the information revolution, the results of this projects have wide-reaching potential applications.</data>

An integrated theoretical and computational investigation will be made of the structural properties of fragile glass-forming liquids and the relation of this structure to the mechanisms of relaxation. Glasses have become an increasingly important class of materials in several new technologies. They possess advantages such as light weight and ease of processing, but suffer from degradation through creep, fatigue, and embrittlement. To understand these mechanisms, it is necessary to understand the structure of glasses and how they relax. At present, experiments can provide information about relaxation processes in glasses, but do not yield much information about their structure or relation of this structure to the relaxation mechanisms. In contrast, computer simulations can provide information about structure, but only on relatively short time and length scales. Moreover, theoretical understanding of glasses is in a relatively crude state. In this research, a sequence of models will be studied beginning with a mean-field model of a glass-forming liquid and proceeding via various approximation methods to include non-mean-field effects. Several parallel computer architectures will be used to extend the size and the time scale of the systems simulated. The simulations will be based on an efficient message passing molecular dynamics program, and by more speculative methods based on Fourier acceleration algorithms and on cellular automata models. The results of the theoretical investigations and computer simulations, in conjunction with ongoing laboratory experiments at Boston University and other locations, will facilitate an understanding of the relation between the relaxation observed experimentally in deeply supercooled liqui ds and glasses and the existence of structures seen in computer simulations.

      <data key="e_title">Building Evolutionary Software Through Modular Executable Specifications and Incremental Derivations</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The first goal of this investigation is a software development strategy in which ultra-modular executable specifications are the starting point of systems design. By ultra-modular is meant a set of specific technologies that allow one to anticipate and realize change, including the use of domain-specific embedded languages to capture high- level, domain-specific semantics, and modular monadic interpreters on which to realize the semantics and associated software tools. Using these techniques a level of modularity in software is obtained that has not been achieved before: namely, modularity at the meta-level of abstract semantics. Second, the research seeks a notion of type-based modularity to capture software architecture. There is a misconception that type systems are contrary to the goals of &quot;dynamic languages,&quot; which in turn are viewed as good candidates for building evolvable systems. This research contests this claim. In fact it is expected that modern typed languages such as ML and Haskell can offer even greater support for constructing reliable and efficient evolutionary software. In particular, the design and use of a higher-order module language is studied to capture systems architecture. Finally, a methodology is investigated that supports the notion of incremental derivations. In this methodology, some executable specifications are refined for improved performance, whether by formal methods (program transformation, partial evaluation, etc.) or by informal methods (such as rewriting inner loops in a lower-level language). The key point is that the derivations themselves can be modularized, thus making them suitable candidates for smooth evolution. When formal methods are employed, this also yields a technique for constructing modular proofs of program correctness; yet another innovative aspect of this approach. These three ideas form the cornerstone of the research effort. To evaluate them, the investigation includes the design of a prototype extens ible operating system. ***</data>

      <data key="e_title">Efficient Fair Queuing and Load Balancing</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Internet traffic is growing rapidly due to the immense popularity of the World Wide Web and new multimedia services such as video-conferencing. The increased traffic volume requires higher speed (Gigabit/sec or higher) links, while some of the new traffic varieties (such as audio and video) also demand quality-of-service guarantees. This proposal addresses the problem of providing high speed links by combining multiple low speed links and performing load balancing. It also address the problem of providing quality of service guarantees for high speed links through the design of efficient fair queuing algorithms. The proposal is concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of new and efficient fair queuing and load balancing algorithms. Although these two problems may look quite different at a first glance, the Pis show that fair queuing algorithms can be converted into load balancing algorithms using a time-reversal argument. Existing mechanisms for fair queuing either are computationally expensive, or they fail to provide the necessary service guarantees (e.g., good bounds on latency and throughput) required by many applications. The PIs develop a new fair queuing scheme called Tandem Clock Fair Queuing, which offers quality-of-service guarantees comparable to those of the best previous schemes (such as Weighted Fair Queuing), and yet appears to admit efficient implementations. Existing methods for load balancing provide inadequate load sharing in the presence of variable length packets, and may result in non-FIFO delivery of data if packet headers are not allowed to be modified. The PIs describe new load balancing schemes that solve these two problems by transforming fair queuing schemes into load balancing schemes, and by using the twin mechanisms of logical reception and sender simulation. The investigators propose to refine and extend these new directions in fair queuing and load balancing algorithms into complete and workable schem es that can be deployed in the Internet and other real networks. They plan to evaluate and refine our schemes using a combination of mathematical analysis, simulations, and actual implementation using a testbed.</data>

The goal is to integrate ideas from randomization and cryptography with realistic existing benchmark in everyday use. There has been tremendous progress in theoretical computer science in recent years, especially with regard to the power of randomization and interaction. These ideas are well suited to the design of uncheatable benchmarks. The purpose of benchmark testing is to estimate the performance and reliability of hardware and software systems. By and large existing benchmark design has focused on &quot;typical&quot; programs and data sets for the system. The problem of making benchmarks resistant to tampering has been mostly ignored. The on-going research in this project has demonstrated the feasibility of applying ideas from computational complexity and cryptography to a wide variety of existing benchmarks, and making them more accurate, resistant to tampering and thus more trustworthy.***</data>

      <data key="e_title">Model Checking of Software Systems</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Software systems keep growing in size and complexity. Our reliance on such systems is likewise increasing, making it critical that they obey the properties their designers intended. Because these properties are global, their consideration cannot be left to the implementation of modules; rather, they must be ensured by design early on. Achieving critical properties thus depends on being able to analyze designs, so that the consequences of design choices can be explored without the cost of implementation, and potentially disastrous flaws can be caught while their repair is still relatively cheap. Analysis methods based on formal, rather than informal, techniques are amenable to mechanical reasoning. Formal methods have had a dramatic impact in hardware verification -- principally due to the success of model checking -- and are being adopted by industry. In software development, on the other hand, formal methods have not yet had the same impact. This is largely because little tool support has been available. Almost any analysis of a software specification seems to require theorem proving. Theorem proving is not feasible for most software developments, since it requires highly skilled proof experts, and cannot be automated fully. Without automatic analysis, formal specification is much less attractive to practitioners. This project has two aspects. First, it investigates the application of model checking techniques to software. This involves both the identification of appropriate abstract representations of large systems, along with the properties they should obey, and the invention of new abstraction techniques to relate such representations to software designs. The abstraction techniques pursued in this research arise in three ways: (1) from the form of the property to be checked (for example, merging states to preserve a universally quantified property); (2) from the application area (for example, not distinguishing the varieties of failure in a distribu ted system); and (3) from the application itself (for example, abstracting the data held in cache lines in the evaluation of a cache protocol). Second, new checking techniques are being developed for specifications that are not currently well served by model checking. Software designs often involve operations on complex data structures that are defined implicitly. In this case, there is no apparent model to be checked; rather, it is necessary to generate models from the specification and determine whether they satisfy intended properties. The project is developing a language, NP, that is roughly a subset of the Z specification language, and a checker, Nitpick, that can both simulate the execution of operations specified implicitly and check inductive properties of operations, by generating models of a relational formula. While emphasizing principles that are expected to find broader application, the project is driven by realistic case studies: railway switching, telephone features, and security protocols. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project is an investigation into some computational problems that arise in the physical mapping and sequencing of chromosomal DNA. The goals of the project are (1) to investigate new strategies for certain parts of these computations, aimed at improving speed and/or reducing the amount of expert intervention required, while preserving solution quality, and (2) to add new capabilities to existing mapping and sequencing systems. A pervasive theme throughout the project is to take experimental error into account in the computations. The investigation into physical mapping concentrates largely on one method in use at the University of Washington&apos;s Department of Molecular Biotechnology, namely Multiple Complete Digest mapping. Within the map assembly stage of this method, new algorithms are being investigated for identifying the clone fragment containing the cloning vector, determining which clone fragments arise from identical fragments on the target DNA being mapped, determining the probability of pairwise clone overlap, and other related problems. In addition, the project includes investigations into a general placement problem in physical mapping, a method of sequencing without mapping, and the effects of experimental error on molecular computation. The principal investigators will use their experience in algorithm design and analysis to help establish a rigorous foundation for the computational aspects of these biological problems. This may in turn result in direct impact on the experimental methods used.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Computational Problems in Physical Mapping and Sequencing</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project is an investigation into some computational problems that arise in the physical mapping and sequencing of chromosomal DNA. The goals of the project are (1) to investigate new strategies for certain parts of these computations, aimed at improving speed and/or reducing the amount of expert intervention required, while preserving solution quality, and (2) to add new capabilities to existing mapping and sequencing systems. A pervasive theme throughout the project is to take experimental error into account in the computations. The investigation into physical mapping concentrates largely on one method in use at the University of Washington&apos;s Department of Molecular Biotechnology, namely Multiple Complete Digest mapping. Within the map assembly stage of this method, new algorithms are being investigated for identifying the clone fragment containing the cloning vector, determining which clone fragments arise from identical fragments on the target DNA being mapped, determining the probability of pairwise clone overlap, and other related problems. In addition, the project includes investigations into a general placement problem in physical mapping, a method of sequencing without mapping, and the effects of experimental error on molecular computation. The principal investigators will use their experience in algorithm design and analysis to help establish a rigorous foundation for the computational aspects of these biological problems. This may in turn result in direct impact on the experimental methods used.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project will study the feasibility of a petaflops-class computer for use in particle simulations in astrophysics and other areas of computational science. The planned system will operate by performing the most CPU-intensive part of a simulation (the computations of long-range interparticle forces) in hardware, leaving the remainder of the calculation to a front-end host computer of more traditional design. Confidence in the basic structure of the hardware is strengthened by the success of the 1.1 Tflops &quot;GRAPE-4&quot; system, which has a similar design philosophy and became operational on 1995. Utilizing straightforward improvements in fabrication technology, a petaflops machine is a realistic goal by the year 2000. Significant questions must be studied to refine design ideas, explore configuration option, and ensure the widest applicability of the new machine. A number of target problem areas in astrophysics, with a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, have been identified. Preliminary estimate suggest that substantial gains will be realized over the conventional general-purpose supercomputers likely to be available in the year 2000, with a time advantage of over a decade in some cases. Outside astrophysics, the subject most likely to benefit from a special-purpose computational engine of this sort are molecular dynamics and vortex fluid methods.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">There are two major problems with the current state of the art in high-performance computing. First, the cost of the very highest end machines lies far beyond the point where widespread deployment is feasible, and second (and more critical) the software environments for these machines are awkward at best, and capable of eking out only fractions of the performance that the hardware is capable of supplying. The thesis of this is that much of the problem stems from our historical separation of memory and CPU logic parts. Individual CPU clock rates and internal architectures continue to accelerate, and thus require ever increasing amounts of bandwidth from the memory subsystem. These rates have far exceeded the bandwidth capabilities of our densest DRAM memory parts (needed to control system costs), and the gap will widen over time. The net effect is complex memory hierarchies, which in turn drives cost and software complexity in addressing these hierarchies efficiently. A new technology is emerging to counter this fundamental defect: the combination on one chip of both dense DRAM and very significant amounts of logic. This capability permits new architectures termed Processing-In-Memory (PIM) to place computing either right next to, or even inside of, the memory macros, where there are huge amounts of raw bandwidth. The first such chip, EXECUBE, integrated onto a 4Mbit DRAM chip 8 complete CPUs configured in a 3D binary hypercube, and was capable of being used as a one chip-type building block for MPPs of both MIMD and SIMD organization. The objective of this project is to look at utilizing PIM technology potentials over the next decade and demonstrate that they promise efficient solution. The approach to be used involves configuring and studying some &quot;point design&quot; MPPs with 100 tera(fl)op potential for several interesting classes of problems, and then utilizing the novel features of these architectures, along with matching system software and software development tools, to attack them in ways that may permit not only exceptional performance, but also greatly simplified programming environments.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">There are two major problems with the current state of the art in high-performance computing. First, the cost of the very highest end machines lies far beyond the point where widespread deployment is feasible, and second (and more critical) the software environments for these machines are awkward at best, and capable of eking out only fractions of the performance that the hardware is capable of supplying. The thesis of this is that much of the problem stems from our historical separation of memory and CPU logic parts. Individual CPU clock rates and internal architectures continue to accelerate, and thus require ever increasing amounts of bandwidth from the memory subsystem. These rates have far exceeded the bandwidth capabilities of our densest DRAM memory parts (needed to control system costs), and the gap will widen over time. The net effect is complex memory hierarchies, which in turn drives cost and software complexity in addressing these hierarchies efficiently. A new technology is emerging to counter this fundamental defect: the combination on one chip of both dense DRAM and very significant amounts of logic. This capability permits new architectures termed Processing-In-Memory (PIM) to place computing either right next to, or even inside of, the memory macros, where there are huge amounts of raw bandwidth. The first such chip, EXECUBE, integrated onto a 4Mbit DRAM chip 8 complete CPUs configured in a 3D binary hypercube, and was capable of being used as a one chip-type building block for MPPs of both MIMD and SIMD organization. The objective of this project is to look at utilizing PIM technology potentials over the next decade and demonstrate that they promise efficient solution.

Stewart from North Carolina State University; and the French investigators are Brigitte Plateau, INRIA (Rhone/Alpes), Bernard Philippe, INRIA (Rennes), and Denis Trystram, University of Grenoble. The objective of their research is to evaluate the performance of crucial aspects of high-speed communication networks. They propose to evaluate the effectiveness of Stochastic Automata Networks (SANs) as a modeling technology for the analysis of telecommunications systems and development and deployment of high-speed networks. They will apply the approach to one aspect of modeling high-speed networks, namely performance analysis of packet delay and loss in a high-speed multiplexer. This multiplexer has been developed to provide flexibility in integrating multi-media traffic. The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in numerical modeling, networking, and parallel processing. This is completed by the French investigators&apos; expertise in Stochastic Automata Networks. Over the last decade, they developed the theory underlying SANs.

      <data key="e_title">Field Trial of Home Internet Use</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Whose aim is to investigate the integration and impacts of residential Internet use among a sample of some 100 urban families in Pennsylvania and some 200 small-town Minnesota families. The Internet and commercial online services are growing rapidly with a substantial portion of this growth occurring through connections to homes. The telecommunications and computing industries are reorganizing to provide electronic services to households through computer-based telecommunications. Despite these changes, we have little understanding of how people at home---in their roles as family members, students, participants in the labor force, as members of groups and communities, or as citizens---would use the new services available to them. Similarly, we have little understanding of how these services, once they are used, will affect peoples&apos; lives. This research project capitalizes on an ongoing field trial of residential Internet use that has been developed with industrial sponsorship. There are three questions driving the research: What leads to diffusion and domestication of technology in homes? How do electronic groups develop? What impact do electronic groups have on peoples&apos; social support, information, and household influence? The goal of this NSF-funded project is to address these questions by developing new measures, designing experiments and field studies, and analyzing data that is being collected from the field trial, focusing on intra-family interactions, the development of electronic groups, and the impact that Internet use has on relations within and among groups.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Field Trial of Home Internet Use</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Whose aim is to investigate the integration and impacts of residential Internet use among a sample of some 100 urban families in Pennsylvania and some 200 small-town Minnesota families. The Internet and commercial online services are growing rapidly with a substantial portion of this growth occurring through connections to homes. The telecommunications and computing industries are reorganizing to provide electronic services to households through computer-based telecommunications. Despite these changes, we have little understanding of how people at home---in their roles as family members, students, participants in the labor force, as members of groups and communities, or as citizens---would use the new services available to them. Similarly, we have little understanding of how these services, once they are used, will affect peoples&apos; lives. This research project capitalizes on an ongoing field trial of residential Internet use that has been developed with industrial sponsorship. There are three questions driving the research: What leads to diffusion and domestication of technology in homes? How do electronic groups develop? What impact do electronic groups have on peoples&apos; social support, information, and household influence? The goal of this NSF-funded project is to address these questions by developing new measures, designing experiments and field studies, and analyzing data that is being collected from the field trial, focusing on intra-family interactions, the development of electronic groups, and the impact that Internet use has on relations within and among groups.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This is a project to develop and extend support for multithreaded computation on superscalar processors. The intention is to provide high processor utilization despite increasing memory latency. In simultaneous multithreading, multiple independent threads will issue instructions to a superscalar processor&apos;s functional units in a single cycle. The objective of this project is to fully define the low-level architecture for simultaneous multithreading, including scheduling, register architecture, pipeline design, and speculative execution. The project is developing compiler and operating systems support for multithreaded execution on the new processor architecture. A primary goal is to maximize multiple thread performance without increasing single thread latency. Most measurements are from detailed simulations, using simulators and compilers provided by industrial partners.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The main objective of this project is to develop a &quot;point design&quot; for an advanced MIMD computer system capable of achieving at least 100 TeraOPS performance with technology that will definitely become feasible in less than a decade. This design will take advantage of free-space optical technologies to produce a one-dimensional building block (BB) that implements efficiently a large, almost fully-connected system of processors. In addition to having a scaleable architecture, our BB is also technology scaleable, and therefore the number of contained processors in the BB could increase dramatically with expected improvements in optical technologies. A simple two-dimensional structure is proposed for the complete system, where the aforementioned one-dimensional BB is extended into two dimensions. With readily available technology, the word-wide optical interconnection network can be viewed as a mesh of relatively short plastic bars to which interfaces to processor cards are attached. Each processor card contains eight processors interconnected locally with an electronic crossbar. Taking advantage of higher-speed optical technologies, all eight processors share the same optical interface to the two-dimensional system. Its high-level architecture is also scaleable, because it can be extended straight forwardly for any number of dimensions larger than two.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The main objective of this project is to develop a &quot;point design&quot; for an advanced MIMD computer system capable of achieving at least 100 TeraOPS performance with technology that will definitely become feasible in less than a decade. This design will take advantage of free-space optical technologies to produce a one-dimensional building block (BB) that implements efficiently a large, almost fully-connected system of processors. In addition to having a scaleable architecture, our BB is also technology scaleable, and therefore the number of contained processors in the BB could increase dramatically with expected improvements in optical technologies. A simple two-dimensional structure is proposed for the complete system, where the aforementioned one-dimensional BB is extended into two dimensions.

      <data key="e_title">An Interdisciplinary Information Model for Biodiversity Collections</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The biological exploration of the earth has resulted in enormous museum collections. Museum specimens and their associated data document biodiversity and provide vital infrastructure supporting the missions of systematics. Access to collections data is crucial for the rapid progress of systematics and ultimately for the assessment, analysis, and management of biotic resources. U.S. collections are held by more than 150 museums and botanical gardens, and the highly partitioned distribution of collections data among autonomously managed databases impedes their effective use. The unmet need is for technology that enables users to assemble data from distributed sources, while hiding the complexity of data distribution, and the heterogeneity among local systems and schemas. The federated databases model architecture has repeatedly been identified as appropriate for developing information interoperability within the biological sciences. Establishing a federation of collections databases imposes a minimal set of requirements for cooperation within a community. While technical solutions for enabling database interoperability will be developed in the computer science community, the required semantic data standards can only result from efforts arising within and carried out by the collections community. This project is being conducted under the auspices of the Association of Systematics Collections (ASC) Committee on Computerization and Networking, and represents a continuation of an effort on behalf of the systematics community (museums and similar institutions) to develop an information model for biological collections. The model will encompass all disciplines, not just plants or single animal groups, and all taxa, not just endangered or threatened species. The goal is to develop a unifying, consensus-based, implementation-independent (conceptual) schema for collections information, down to the level of the atomic data concept. This project does not propose to build a collections database management system, but rather, to establish a semantic data standard that will enable specimen data to be combined across systematics disciplines to address pressing resource management needs and to test complex research questions.</data>

      <data key="e_title">PDS: Hybrid Technology Multi-Threaded Architecture</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This short-term research project will address the challenge of achieving near PetaOps scale performance within a decade through innovative systems that exhibit wide applicability and ease of use. The objective of the proposed research is to determine the feasibility and detailed structure of a parallel architecture integrating the combined capabilities of semiconductor, superconductor, and optical technologies. This hybrid architecture approach is motivated by the realization that a mix of technologies may yield superior operational attributes to those possible based solely on semiconductor technology in the same time frame. An interdisciplinary team of collaborators has been assembled to conduct the required point-design study in order to devise a complete system structure and evaluate its performance characteristics using a small set of scientific application kernels. The proposed hybrid technology approach exploits critical opportunities enabled by key emerging devices. Specifically computational performance can be dramatically improved through recent advances in Superconducting Rapid Single Flux Quantum logic which will make 100 Ghz clock rates feasible in the next two years. Memory capacity may be drastically increased through a new memory hierarchy, merging advanced semiconductor high density memory and future (admittedly more speculative) optical 3-D holographic storage capable of storing 0.1 Petabits or more. Interconnection bandwidth will be greatly enhanced by means of optical networks with 100 Gbps channels.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The objective of this work is the point design study of the Illinois Aggressive Cache-Only Memory Architecture (I-ACOMA) multiprocessor, a novel distributed shared-memory, multiprocessor (DSM) that delivers petaflop-scale performance without surrendering programmability. I-ACOMA is designed to address some of the most important challenges that architects will face in the next two decades, namely the widening gap between the speed of multi-Ghz processors and the much slower cache hierarchy, memory and network subsystems, the increasing under-utilization of the large number of transistors that can be embedded on a processor chip, and the disappointingly poor machine utilization in many key applications like sparse computations and database workloads. To address these issues, I-ACOMA includes a very aggressive memory hierarchy, multithreaded superscalar processors, and architectural support for sparse computations and databases. On the software side, the code running on I-ACOMA is generated by a compiler that automatically parallelizes Fortran 90 programs. The compiler exposes both loop- and instruction-level parallelism. In addition, it generates data forward directives. Finally, on the application side, while I-ACOMA is a general-purpose machine, it will focus on two sets of grand challenge applications, namely sparse computations and database applications.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This research proposal seeks to use fractal or self-similar models to describe the long-range correlations observed in measurements of traffic from actual networks, and apply techniques to deal with fractal models, well-known in physics but hardly ever used in the area of network performance analysis, to obtain relevant insight into the performance of modern high-speed networks for their design, management, and control. The research seeks to quantify the impact of fractal traffic characteristics on network performance, building on the present experience with self-similar traffic models. First, the work will extend the understanding of simple single-server models achieved by the PIs and other authors. The effects of complications such as multiple service classes and finite buffer sizes, and the modifications needed when self similarity is only asymptotic (relevant for variable-bit-rate services) will be considered. Second, the effects of connecting a large number of nodes in a network will be investigated including issues such as the robustness of self similarity. Finally, the project will tackle the difficult problems of understanding the transformations induced on self similar traffic by network controls as well as the consequences of self similarity on the effectiveness of the controls themselves. The work will consist of constructing simple models for networks, testing their validity through numerical simulations, and comparing their behavior with experimental measurements from real networks. The behavior of these models will be studied through a combination of numerical and analytical techniques.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Enabling the Commerical Realization of Temporal Databases</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">*** 9632569 Snodgrass A wide range of database applications manage time-varying information. Such applications typically use conventional relational systems, which include little support for temporal applications, other than date and time data types. The research community has done a remarkable job of incorporating the many novel ideas of twenty years of research in the consensus temporal query language TSQL2. The SQL3 committee has started the process of transferring the facilities of TSQL2 into the standard by approving a new part, SQL/Temporal. As a part of this GOALI project, TSQL2 validation suite is being designed. Secondly, a functional prototype for the entire language is being developed; this prototype can be tested with the validation suite. A set of case studies comparing SQL and TSQL2 solutions utilizes the prototype to provide an evaluation of the practical utility of the language constructs. These artifacts will be made available to the standards bodies and to vendors interested in enabling via their products the development and productions gains made possible with temporal database technology, thereby ensuring a direct transfer of insights from the temporal database research community to industry. ***</data>

      <data key="e_title">Smart Programming Environments</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Type safety is an essential feature of advanced programming environments for the rapid development of reliable software, but it is not sufficient. Programmers try to eliminate as many errors as possible by reasoning about the program&apos;s behavior. To support this activity, this research seeks to design and construct smart programming environments. A smart programming environment is a system for writing, editing, executing, and analyzing programs. For the latter, the environment includes &quot;soft type checkers&quot;, tools for verifying simple program invariants. Most notably, these are the preconditions for each program operation. Two prototypes of soft type checkers for Scheme have been developed, based on different analysis methods. One uses an adaptation of Hindley-Milner type inference (for a non- standard type algebra); the other uses a form of set-based analysis. This research would extend the tools, and seeks (1) to develop a new class of soft typers that combine the advantages of Hindley-Milner and set-based analysis, (2) to incorporate additional verification technology, (3) to develop alternative interfaces for exploring the verifier&apos;s reasoning, and (4) to extend the tools for modular programming. In addition, ways are being explored to transfer the technology to lower-level languages, such as a safe sublanguage of C++ (similar to Java) in the programming environment. ***</data>

      <data key="e_title">Compilation and Automatic Optimization of Network Protocol Implementations</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Network software is hard to design, implement, debug, and maintain. This basic problem is compounded by heterogeneity and the need for high performance. Heterogeneity results in multiplying the amount of networking software that must be developed and maintained. To improve performance, networking software is often hand-crafted in an operating system kernel, where software is particularly hard to debug and maintain. Emerging high-speed networking technology, coupled with next generation multimedia applications, is resulting in increased demand for high performance and extremely flexible networking software. A fundamental theme of this proposal is that advances in network software can only be achieved by an approach that simultaneously considers programming ease, platform diversity, and performance. This proposal investigates the use of compiler technology to rapidly prototype and automatically optimize complex protocol software. The result is network software that is easier to write, more portable, and more maintainable. Yet, with the appropriate automatic optimizations, the performance of such implementations should compare favorably to the performance of hand-crafted implementations. The first part of our proposal concerns techniques for automatically optimizing network software to achieve Gigabit link speeds. This involves inventing new optimization techniques (e.g., fusing together individual message demultiplexing definitions into efficient demultiplexing code), automating existing optimization paradigms (e.g., header prediction and address caching), and extending existing work on automated optimization techniques. Our plans call for building on the existing theory underlying optimizing compilers to unify various ad hoc techniques, and to provide a point of departure for producing new optimization techniques. The second part of our proposal involves a framework that integrates our optimization techniques to support rapid prototyping of efficient ne tworking software. We enable protocol code to be developed without undue attention paid to low-level wire data formats; operating system specific mechanisms for demultiplexing, synchronization, or error handling. This allows an extremely compact protocol description that is then compiled and optimized by our framework to a wide range of target environments. These environments include a simulator, application-level network interfaces, and shared-memory multiprocessor platforms.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) propose acquisition of the first commercial MTA system. The salient features of the Tera MTA multiprocessors are: -high-speed GaAs processors, -its multi-threaded architecture (hence MTA), which should allow more concurrency and thus higher processor efficiency, -an interconnection network scalable to hundreds of processors, -shared memory with its convenient programming model and broad applicability, -a sophisticated compiler for automatic parallelization. This system will be made accessible to researchers and educators nationwide for production computing and computer science experimentation. In addition, local researchers will evaluate performance of the MTA a from both systems and applications perspectives.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9634813 Peshkin Assistive devices aid in maneuvering subcomponents with safety and ergonomic benefit, thereby reducing worker strain and fatigue during assembly operations. However, these devices usually reduce freedom of motion and dexterity. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry cooperative research project between Northwestern University and General Motors will investigate programmable constraint machines as assistive devices for assembly, promising to retain dexterity and freedom of motion. Programmable constraint machines use sensors and control methods to provide two modes of operation: a free or &quot;castering&quot; mode where essentially unconstrained motion is possible for moving subassemblies into position, and a constrained or &quot;wall&quot; mode where a software barrier or guide is used to move a subassembly into prescribed position. Programmed constraint devices do not servo an assembly into position, so they are essentially passive devices that rely on the human operator&apos;s dexterity and the use of these software guides to ease the assembly task. This cooperative project will result in half scale prototype devices and full scale implementation at the General Motors Assembly Center. This project will advance theoretical and applied research in the areas of robotics and assembly. The potential impact of this research on improved worker safety will lead to productivity and cost benefits.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9634813 Peshkin Assistive devices aid in maneuvering subcomponents with safety and ergonomic benefit, thereby reducing worker strain and fatigue during assembly operations. However, these devices usually reduce freedom of motion and dexterity. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry cooperative research project between Northwestern University and General Motors will investigate programmable constraint machines as assistive devices for assembly, promising to retain dexterity and freedom of motion. Programmable constraint machines use sensors and control methods to provide two modes of operation: a free or &quot;castering&quot; mode where essentially unconstrained motion is possible for moving subassemblies into position, and a constrained or &quot;wall&quot; mode where a software barrier or guide is used to move a subassembly into prescribed position. Programmed constraint devices do not servo an assembly into position, so they are essentially passive devices that rely on the human operator&apos;s dexterity and the use of these software guides to ease the assembly task. This cooperative project will result in half scale prototype devices and full scale implementation at the General Motors Assembly Center. This project will advance theoretical and applied research in the areas of robotics and assembly. The potential impact of this research on improved worker safety will lead to productivity and cost benefits.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The original World-Wide Web (WWW) architecture--which requires a network connection from a client to a possible distant server for each document retrieved--is not scalable. Servers and network have limited bandwidth that cannot keep pace with continuing growth in Web usage, particularly as the popularity of bandwidth-intensive media types, such as video, grows. This project addresses Web scalability by characterizing WWW traffic and applying that characterization to design and evaluating algorithms to cache and prefetch documents within networks. The project has five objectives: to 1) collect traces from four disparate traffic sources; 2) prepare to handle the large volume of collected traces by extending methods to collect, visualize, analyze, and model Web traffic using the Chitra trace analysis tool; 3) use techniques from objective two to characterize Web traffic based on the traces collected for objective one; 4) develop a predictive model and simulation of clients, servers, and Web traffic in the context of universities and community networks that permits the design and evaluation of algorithms for in-network document caching to reduce the bandwidth requirements of Web servers and networks. The simulation will use results from workload characterization. The model will allow a network manager to place and configure in network caches (e.g. proxy servers) within an existing network; and 5) design and evaluate, through simulation, algorithms to prefetch documents, thereby partially hiding latency.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to measure, archive and distribute MPEG II video traffic from the 1996 Summer Olympics. The objective is to create a library of traffic signatures that can be used by the research community. Potential uses of this library are in 1) resource management studies (e.g., scheduling and call-admission control), 2) compression algorithms, and 3) video storage and retrieval performance. The MPEG-II library will be supplemented with approximately two hours of Graphics and Visualization traffic (slightly over one GByte) collected over the Graphics, Visualization and Usability Center&apos;s network on their January 18, 1996 demonstration day. Together they should add to the networking community&apos;s traffic database on emerging multi-media applications. Recent traffic studies indicate that slowly-decaying auto-correlation functions and heavy-tailed marginal densities in input traffic have a significant impact on queue length statistics at a multiplexor. Further, variable bit-rate video applications have shown to exhibit slowly decaying auto-correlation functions with Gamma/Pareto marginals. Protocols and systems need to exist in the environment and need to be built for this environment. Generating representative workloads is, therefore, an important step towards effective resource management.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Database Tools for Analyzing Forest Canopy Information</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The forest canopy is increasingly regarded as a region of great ecological importance. Canopy communities are poorly understood, partly due to access problems and partly due to a lack of expertise and software tools to analyze complex three-dimensional tree crown data. The PIs propose an interdisciplinary effort to develop database systems to manage, analyze, and disseminate shared data pertaining to complex ecological questions using forest canopy data. The demonstration project will be carried about among seven cooperating but independent researchers at a forest canopy research site, the Wind River Canopy Research Facility in Washington State. Data from existing projects that focus at different spatial and temporal scales will be linked to allow efficient use of site data and to solve novel questions that could not be addressed by a single researcher&apos;s data sets. The resulting database management tools will allow researchers to easily gain access to site- specific data and each others&apos; data, which will enhance the productivity both of the individual scientists and of the site as a whole. The initial research focus will be on the development of data models and prototype data structures and data sets for one concurrent study of forest canopy structure and hydrology. That research examines the role of forest canopies in intercepting, modifying, retaining, and conducting water from atmospheric sources (rain, mist, snow) to the forest floor. Forest canopy structure has obvious implications in these processes, but the complexity and three-dimensional nature of forest canopies (especially those of old-growth, structurally complex forests) has prevented ecologists from gaining a quantified understanding of the patterns and processes underlying these interactions. The PI will also continue refining the two database browsers for the Wind River Site data and will extend the data model for those browsers to show the connection with the canopy structure and hydro logy model. Development of a sound data model will allow forest canopy scientists to organize, visualize, and analyze their data in powerful ways. It will also provide the means to link forest canopy structural data with relevant environmental data sets (such as meteorological data) and with other forest functional data sets (e.g., photosynthesis of canopy organisms).</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9630293 Selker This proposal was reviewed by the Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry panel (solicitation NSF 96-2) and jointly funded by several divisions at the National Science Foundation: Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, Earth Science, Environmental Biology, and Mathematical Sciences. The dynamic temporal and spatial distribution of microbes in the unsaturated media above aquifers is essentially unknown; though it is recognized that the distribution can be significantly heterogeneous. Since microbial communities in the unsaturated zone degrade the vast majority of contaminants applied to the earth&apos;s surface, this lack in understanding presents profound limitations to our ability to predict or enhance this essential contaminant treatment system. These studies involve the development and application of an analytical methodology that allows for direct, continuous observation of microbial distribution and activity, as well as the transport of contaminants through heterogeneous unsaturated porous media. This is made possible through the unification of two new technologies in an interdisciplinary effort between groundwater hydrology and environmental microbiology, namely: (1) the utilization of bioluminescent microbes to quantify microbial activity and contaminant movement; and (2) the use of light transmission chambers to quantify pore water content, pressure, and hydraulic flow paths. The system employs a naphthalene-degrading bacterium, Pseudomonas flourescens HK44, which has a lux gene cassette inserted into the naphthalene degradation pathway such that light is emitted in direct proportion to the rate of degradation of naphthalene or its metabolite salicylate. These experiments will be carried out in two-dimensional glass-walled flow cells containing packed aquifer sands at two scales: 2 x 1.5 m and 60 x 60 cm. The flow cells provide for controlled aqueous flux, illumination, and continuous time-lapse video and digital CCD imaging of the entire experiment. The effect s of geologic heterogeneity will be studied by packing the chambers with fine over coarse sand textural interfaces. Theses studies will: 1) Determine if regions of heterogeneous microbial colonization develop in otherwise uniform porous media under continuous unsaturated flow conditions. 2) Evaluate the effect of geological heterogeneities (textural variation) on localization of microbial development. 3) Investigate the combined and possibly interacting effects of geological and biological heterogeneities on contaminant fate and transport. 4) Assess the predictive capabilities of present microbial and hydrodynamic theory with respect to the experimental results of this research through the use of numerical models which simulate flow and microbial habitat. These studies will provide a powerful new analytical tool for the scientific and engineering communities to gain understanding of subsurface microbial activity and growth in natural and contaminated sites. The ability to make quantitative non-destructive observations on the rate and position of microbial activity, while monitoring water content and pressure, will significantly increase the capability to exploit microbial degradation toward environmental bioremediation. ***</data>

      <data key="e_title">Links Between Soil Nutrient Dynamics and Surface Water Biogeochemistry Following Deforestation for Pasture Agriculture in Amazonia</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9630278 Deegan This project will examine how the conversion of moist tropical forest to cattle pasture in the Amazon Basin alters the patterns and rates of element cycles in soils and how these changes are linked to changes in the chemistry and ecology of small streams. The Amazon is a region with one of the world&apos;s highest rates of conversion of natural ecosystems to human dominated use. Cattle pasture is the dominant use of deforested lands. Conversion of native forest to pasture causes large changes in the patterns and rates of nutrient cycling and the potential for nutrient losses from soils. Small streams function as key hydrologic and biochemical links between upland soils and downstream aquatic ecosystems. This project will examine soils and streams in small drainage basins in Rondonia, rapidly developing state in the southwest Brazilian Amazon. Four pairs of drainage basins will be compared. One basin in each pair will drain intact forest, the other will drain land that has been cleared and planted to cattle pasture. The availability of nitrogen, phosphorus and major ions will be examined in drainage basin soils. Measurements of streamwater concentrations and forms of nitrogen, phosphorus, major cations and anions, trace elements and suspended sediments in the paired catchments will link changes in soil chemistry with stream biogeochemistry. To determine how long the influence of one land use is maintained as streams pass through one land use to another, the rates at which nutrients are taken up will be determined by measuring solute concentrations upstream and downstream of land use boundaries and by experimental injections of nitrate and phosphate and a non-reactive tracer in forest and pasture streams to determine how biogeochemical inputs from soils in the drainage basin affect stream organic matter production. This work will provide important new information that will help to predict the effect of agricultural development and deforestation. Examination of stream pro ductivity will provide new information on how land use change affects biological functions that maintain water quality and support fisheries that are important to human well-being. On a longer time frame, this project will provide a foundation for future modeling efforts to link land use changes in small watersheds with biogeochemical changes in the larger rivers of the Amazon using models of water routing and within stream biogeochemical processing. This proposal was submitted to the Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry solicitation, and the project is being jointly supported by the Divisions of Earth Sciences (Geosciences), Environmental Biology (Biological Sciences), Mathematical Sciences (Mathematical and Physical Sciences) and International Programs -Brazil (Social, Behavioral &amp; Economic Sciences).</data>

      <data key="e_title">Study of Feedback Congestion Control Techniques</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Feedback-based congestion control schemes become an integral part of the connectionless ABR (Available Bit Rate) service class in ATM networks. The major objective of the proposed research is to build a theoretical foundation to feedback congestion control schemes. The basis of the foundation is the fixed-point model, which captures the feed-back feature of ABR congestion control schemes in a system of delay differential equations and produce fixed-point constant solutions in terms of the source cell rates and the buffer lengths. lamely, we consider a broad class of schemes which can produce a stable buffer length even when sources always try to transmit at their maximum rates. Analyses of the fixed point model in the context of ABR feedback control schemes have generated a number of results regarding stabilities of fixed-point solutions. The proposed research will first compare the stability region of parameter space derived from the delay differential equations with that obtained by discrete simulation techniques. We are interested in effects of incorporating details of control protocols in simulation on resulting changes in the stability region. Besides, the fixed point model will be investigated in the environments where ABR bandwidth changes in time as the number of CBR and VBR connections changes. Since the fixed-point model is constructed in a general context, application of the model to several control theoretic strategies (such as a proportional plus derivative control) will be investigated. When a congestion develops (either due to a new active ABR source or due to a reduced ABR bandwidth), buffer lengths increase before they stabilize to a new steady-state buffer length. Since buffer transients are inevitable, we will investigate strategies that can control the buffer transients in a predictable manner. We will first characterize transients in terms of bounds: the maximum overshoot in buffer lengths, the rise time until the buffer length reaches its maximum, and the settling time for the buffer length to reach its new steady-state value. According to the fixed-point model, relationships between the set of parameters and the transient bounds will be investigated. The relationships are to be studied in increasingly complex network configurations.</data>

To attain this goal Bellin and Monroe of North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical State University recommend that three main program components be addressed: recruiting, mentoring and graduate study (Computing Research News, Jan. 95). Instead of targeting isolated aspects of the student experience, a broad strategy that manages all stages of student progress from high school to professional career is proposed. Recruitment is addressed by outreach and bridge programs, and expanded computer science specific recruitment efforts. Retention strategies include scholarships and mentoring at all levels. The establishment of a graduate degree program and under-graduate research programs is an integral part of the plan.

      <data key="e_abstract">9633159 Eschen, Elaine Fielder, Vivian Fisk University Proposal for CISE Minority Institutions Infrastructure Grant: Expanding the Minority Pipeline: C.S. at Fisk University Fisk University, a small HBCU-MI with 69.8% female students has an outstanding reputation of producing highly qualified graduates in many scientific disciplines. As such, Fisk is excellently situated to be instrumental in the national effort to increase the numbers of African-Americans and women in computer science. The purpose of this project is to design a five-year plan for the development of the human and technological infrastructure necessary for Fisk to be a national model for the attraction and retention of female and African-American computer science students. To attain this goal Bellin and Monroe of North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical State University recommend that three main program components be addressed: recruiting, mentoring and graduate study (Computing Research News, Jan. 95). Instead of targeting isolated aspects of the student experience, a broad strategy that manages all stages of student progress from high school to professional career is proposed. Recruitment is addressed by outreach and bridge programs, and expanded computer science specific recruitment efforts. Retention strategies include scholarships and mentoring at all levels. The establishment of a graduate degree program and under-graduate research programs is an integral part of the plan. The enhanced infrastructure supports the expansion of faculty research programs which are the basis for student research activities.</data>

      <data key="e_title">CRI: Context-Dependent Mechanisms for Cortical Gain Control</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">IBN: 9634367 PI: Finkel Gain control is a powerful process that is used in many biological and engineering applications. In a videocamera, the photodetectors can only operate over a limited range of light levels, so in order to be able to record in bright daylight and dim internal light, the signal must be re-scaled to stay within a limited range of intensities. A slightly smarter system, used in more expensive devices, is to change the gain (how much the signal is amplified) separately in each local region. Changing the amount of gain in an adaptive manner allows signals to be extracted from ambient noise. The same principles of gain control act in our visual system-- in a simple manner on the pupil to control light entering the eye, but in increasingly more sophisticated ways as one goes to higher levels in the visual cortex. Our goal is to investigate these mechanisms of cortical gain control to better understand how the visual sytem works, and as a means of uncovering new image processing applications. The cortex has the ability to control gain not only based on spatial location, but also in a context-dependent manner. The response to a particular feature, say a short line segment, depends upon what other features are present in the image. If the line segment forms part of a circle or an extended line, the response is increased. Psychophysical studies have identified the conditions under which certain features &quot;pop-out&quot; and become the focus of visual attention. Recent physiological studies have shown that cortical cells are exquisitely sensitive to small changes in the context of the scene. It is believed that response changes are a result of a change in gain of individual cortical cells, but the mechanisms controlling cell gain are poorly understood. We are particularly interested in differential changes of gain among different cells in a neural population. Most features are represented, in the cortex, by a set of graded responses ove r a population of cells. The orientation of a line, for example, is coded by a distribution of responses over cells that prefer various orientations (vertical, horizontal, oblique). We hypothesize that inputs from stimuli in the visual image act to differentially change the gain of cells. A differential change in gain across a population would lead to increased sensitivity--a better estimate of line orientation, or whatever feature is being analyzed. This type of context-dependent gain control could lead to enhanced discrimination of the salient features in an image. We will carry out a series of physiological experiments in cat visual cortex to investigate this hypothesis. We also will conduct a set of computer simulations of various cellular mechanisms to test our model. Finally, we will build a prototype image processing device, based on these findings, and apply it to real images.</data>

      <data key="e_title">ImageFlow: Real-Time Image-Based Rendering</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Depth images are used as rendering primitives in the high-performance graphics engine that is being constructed in this project. A depth image is a two- dimensional image that includes depth relative to a viewpoint, in addition to color and other properties. From a small number of depth images, each of which represents an arbitrarily complex scene from a single viewpoint, an image can be computed for any viewpoint within the neighborhood of the original viewpoints. This image-based rendering approach offers advantages in realism and distributing the rendering computation among processors that generate depth images and those that reproject them to new viewpoints. The project is using the existing PixelFlow graphics engine to test the image- based rendering ideas. During the first part of the project, algorithms for acquiring and pre-processing depth images will be investigated. At the same time, the PixelFlow machine will be enhanced for image acquisition and storage. This will permit software for image-based rendering to run in real-time on the PixelFlow machine, performing the following operations: determination of reference images to be used as sources of depth pixels, warping of reference image pixels to the screen space, evaluation color, area, and other parameters for each pixel, and blending of pixels to form the final reference image. In later stages of the project, hardware support may be developed and evaluated for some of these operations.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9614924 Klavans A major obstacle to the further development of digital libraries, and the national information infrastructure as a whole, is the lack of adequate means of providing digital objects on any basis other than free, unrestricted access. Publishers wish to specify terms of use and ensure those terms are enforced (optionally collecting payment), before providing valuable materials on the net. While the latter topics are the subject of much commercial activity, the former seems to have been largely neglected. This workshop will attempt to begin a process of defining a common machine-readable language for expressing the terms and conditions of use of electronic objects, and more generally assess alternative frameworks and means for the technologies of terms and conditions in a distributed network-based environment.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9634485 Glinert, Ephraim Champagne, Matthew Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute CISE Educational Innovation: A Distributed Collaborative Learning Environment for Effective Intellectual Teamwork Across the Curriculum. This CISE Educational Innovation award supports the integration of research into the undergraduate curriculum through the development of a Distributed Collaborative Learning Environment (DCLE), a hybrid physical and electronic space which will enable teams of students to meet and learn in flexible configurations, across the computer science curriculum. The project will include development and delivery of courses that exploit the new capabilities, formal assessment of the effectiveness of the new learning environment, and wide dissemination of concepts, architecture, and prototype systems developed. In the DCLE environment, the students comprising a team may be in one room, even seated around the same table. At other times, they may be seated around two or more tables, or some may be located elsewhere on campus (even geographically remote). Whatever the physical layout may be, each student&apos;s computer is linked to those of all other teammates, and innovative system software provides powerful support for collaborative information development, sharing and exchange, through a variety of flexible and natural interfaces suited to the task and the individual user. This project is part of an overall effort jointly supported by the Office of Cross Disciplinary Activities (CDA) in CISE and the Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) in EHR with the DUE funding supporting an emphasis on distance learning, utilizing the developed DCLE in a virtual classroom and with instruction delivered on an experimental basis from University of California/Davis to RPI.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9634485 Glinert, Ephraim Champagne, Matthew Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute CISE Educational Innovation: A Distributed Collaborative Learning Environment for Effective Intellectual Teamwork Across the Curriculum. This CISE Educational Innovation award supports the integration of research into the undergraduate curriculum through the development of a Distributed Collaborative Learning Environment (DCLE), a hybrid physical and electronic space which will enable teams of students to meet and learn in flexible configurations, across the computer science curriculum. The project will include development and delivery of courses that exploit the new capabilities, formal assessment of the effectiveness of the new learning environment, and wide dissemination of concepts, architecture, and prototype systems developed. In the DCLE environment, the students comprising a team may be in one room, even seated around the same table. At other times, they may be seated around two or more tables, or some may be located elsewhere on campus (even geographically remote). Whatever the physical layout may be, each student&apos;s computer is linked to those of all other teammates, and innovative system software provides powerful support for collaborative information development, sharing and exchange, through a variety of flexible and natural interfaces suited to the task and the individual user. This project is part of an overall effort jointly supported by the Office of Cross Disciplinary Activities (CDA) in CISE and the Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) in EHR with the DUE funding supporting an emphasis on distance learning, utilizing the developed DCLE in a virtual classroom and with instruction delivered on an experimental basis from University of California/Davis to RPI.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Logical Support for High-Assurance Software Evolution</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">A central problem in the management of large software projects and the maintenance of libraries of reusable software is ensuring the consistency of inter-module connections in the face of continuing system evolution. As bugs are isolated and fixed, capabilities are added or enhanced in response to changes in the user requirements, and support software and hardware is upgraded or replaced, there are myriad opportunities for invalidation of prior assumptions used in code development. In this project, techniques from logic, type theory, and abstract interpretation are employed in the design and implementation of tools to help automate the process of ensuring consistency. A partial-evaluation-driven abstract-interpretation algorithm is used to analyze individual modules for consistency with respect to local specifications, and a linking and configuration manager will be used to check for correspondence between module specifications. Using abstract interpretation, proof generation, and realizability techniques, the manager synthesizes common additional code that may be needed to provide trustworthy linkages. Two aspects of this approach are essential for application to large-scale, evolving systems: (i)link updating must be a local process, so that small changes do not incur large penalties, and (ii)linkage information must be available to the programmer in a user-readable format. Recent experience with building efficient, usable logic tools is applied in the project towards satisfying these requirements. ***</data>

      <data key="e_title">Adaptive Multicast Transport of Realtime Video Over ATM Networks</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">While existing research shows that reactive congestion control mechanisms are capable of providing high video quality and channel utilization for point-to-point real-time video, there has been relatively little study of the reactive congestion control of point-to-multipoint video, especially in ATM networks. Problems complicating the provision of multicast, feedback-based, real-time video service include (1) implosion of feedback returning to the source as the number of multicast destinations increases, and (2) variance in the amount of available bandwidth on different branches in the multipoint connection. The proposed research addresses and solves the two problems mentioned above by introducing and investigating a new service for real-time multicast video. Multipoint feedback mechanisms are used to adaptively control the transmission rates of each layer of a multi-layered video stream. The proposed service relies on adaptive, multi-layered coding at the video source and closed-loop feedback from the network in order to control the high and low priority video generation rates of the video encoder. It also supports a minimum bandwidth guarantee and the best effort support of video traffic exceeding the minimum rate. To study these mechanisms, mathematical analysis, simulations, and empirical experiments using the ATM testbed network available to the P.I. are employed.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Integrating Formal and Informal Techniques: An Approach to Evolutionary Systems Development</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">A formal method consists of a well-defined specification language and a rigorously defined set of rules that can be used to reason about the specifications expressed in that language. The specification language is used to describe the intended system behavior. In order to facilitate the use of formal methods for software development, particularly for high-assurance systems, the objective of this project is to produce a set of integrated techniques that support the use of formal methods for all phases of software development. Towards this end, several new techniques and tools are being developed that support the application of formal methods for software engineering. These include tools to support correct program derivation from formal specifications, to formally specify requirements analysis and design information, to determine software reuse based on formal specifications, to reverse engineer existing software to obtain formal descriptions, and to statically analyze requirements specifications for completeness and consistency. Formal specifications can be checked for consistency and completeness using automated techniques. However, during the initial phases of a project, it may be difficult to construct formal specifications directly. In contrast, many developers find it more intuitive to create diagrams to model their systems. As a means to bridge the gap between formal and informal approaches to software development, this research investigates the formalization of a commonly used modeling notation, known as the Object Modeling Technique. The notation comprises three complementary diagrams: object (entity-relation) diagrams, state diagrams, and data flow diagrams. These three diagrams, respectively, model the architecture (static), behavior (dynamic), and data flow and services of a given system. The results of the formalization studies will enable the automated generation of formal specifications from diagrams. The next step is to investigate and develop formal semantics for the integration of the three models. Finally, design transformations are studied that can be applied to the diagrams and the corresponding specifications. ***</data>

      <data key="e_title">CONACYT: Design and Implementation of a Wireless Communication System using BiCMOS Technologies</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9613722 Sanchez-Sinencio The main goal of this proposal is to identify, characterize, model, and design algorithms and devices that are essential in wireless system applications, using a unified approach. This involves a (top-down) hierarchical design all the way from the system point of view, to the transistor level implementation. Tradeoffs between system architecture, BiCMOS circuit implementations, cost, power consumption, and performance at different levels will be identified. This research will yield important practical results that form the basis for many wireless communication products, and specifically those to be used for the upcoming personal communication systems (PCS) and in communication over the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) bands. The tradeoffs in building complete wireless communication products in integrated circuit form, versus hybrids (with off-chip components) will be a key component of the proposed research. This work proposed in this proposal encompasses theory, software simulation, and hardware implementations. The uniqueness of the approach is based on the coordinated effort of two groups with proven accomplishments in communications and microelectronics circuits. Heavy interaction between both faculty members and graduate students from the two institutions proposing this project is expected. The Texas A&amp;M University contribution will be in the communication system architectures, multiple-access techniques (i.e. CDMA, TDMA, etc.), signal processing algorithms, mixers, and active and passive filters. The INAOE contribution will be mainly in the BiCMOS circuit design of key building blocks. These blocks include the front-end low noise amplifier (LNA), power amplifiers, channel encoders/decoders, and correlators. The feasibility and performance of the proposed designs will be verified first by software simulation involving tradeoffs, experimental verification b silicon chip-prototypes of important building blocks, and some system applications resul ts. A successful conclusion of this proposal research will lead to practical, unified design methodologies for designing wireless communication systems, especially those for PCS and unlicensed devices operating in the ISM bands. Contributions at the system, building block, and hardware levels and their interrelations are anticipated. This research will have an important effect on the infrastructure of wireless research and education in our universities, since a significant number of students are already involved. Funding for these students will come not only potentially from the support requested in this proposal, but also from present support, exceeding half a million dollars, from the College of Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University, as well as from Texas Instruments, over the next three years. The utility and relevance of the proposed research is based on substantial industrial ties, and strong exchange of ideas between academia and university. ***</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This research proposes a preliminary evaluation of enabling technologies for 100 TeraFLOP class computers. The research is broadly classified into the following parts: architectures (single node architecture, parallel architecture), system software (languages, compilers, programming tools and environments), algorithms (design models, performance and scalability) , and applications (scaling and realizable performance). Single node architectures for future generation computers will exploit considerable implicit parallelism. Candidate technologies for single node architectures include super-scalar execution, very long instruction words, simultaneous hardware multithreading, and processors-in-memory. The PIs propose a processor architecture based on the VLIW with possible implementations using PIMs. Parallel architectures are based on clusters of these nodes in a hierarchical network. Due to the large number of computational units, algorithm design and scalability issues become critical. Hierarchical decomposition of problems with an emphasis on proper mapping to the underlying architecture is necessary. Whereas problems at higher levels must be loosely coupled, they can be very tightly coupled at lower levels. Alternate algorithm design methodologies and abstract machine models must be constructed. Finally, the scope of applications that can effectively use these architectures needs to be identified. This research will perform a study of each of these aspects of future generation computers. The PIs expect to draw heavily from their experience in the design of scalable parallel algorithms and architectures and from the CEDAR project.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Data Management for Wireless Communication Networks</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Data management is critical to the functioning of wide-area wireless communication networks. The communication infrastructure maintains user profiles to keep track of information for operations such as call setup and delivery, subscriber authentication, and billing. Data management deals with the problem of efficiently managing the information in user profiles, which may be distributed across the network. In evaluating different data management schemes, performance measures of interest are: 1) profile lookup and update response times; 2) individual and global database access requirements: 3) individual communication link and global signaling bandwidth requirements; 4) total memory requirement; and 5)overall system cost. Information in user profiles can be classified into &quot;system information&quot;, such as current locations of subscribers and subscriber authorization information, &quot;service provider information&quot;, such as billing records, and &quot;feature support information&quot;, such as numbers for call screening or call blocking. These different categories of information have different demands on their data management schemes. One of the primary objectives of our proposed research is to investigate and develop novel database architectures and protocols for efficiently managing all the classes of information in user profiles. Specific schemes will be designed to meet the various data management requirements. We are especially interested in developing schemes that, unlike current schemes, provide lifelong user numbers through the support of location independent numbering. Scalability and backward compatibility to existing standards, IS-41 and GSM, are also important design issues. We have conceived a promising architecture that is based on a hierarchical organization of databases. Its performance will be compared with a representative set of other data management schemes through extensive simulation studies using a realistic software simulator that we are developing. Another major objective of our proposal is to develop a realistic and extensible simulation platform for studying the performance of data management schemes. Realistic user call and movement models are crucial to our performance evaluations. We will develop detailed call and movement models and corroborate them using actual traffic data. We have laid the foundation in this area through the development of the first version of a highly configurable software simulator, Pleiades. Our research in user behavior models for our simulations is expected to have applications in other areas of wireless communication research.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Routing Support for Wireless and Mobile Applications</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Mobile hosts in a wireless network can move from one location to another while maintaining continuous network connections. This project aims to develop routing mechanisms for wireless networks that are scalable and are compatible with wired networks. It integrates the basic IP mobility support with hierarchical dynamic routing protocols, allowing efficient routing to mobile hosts through secure and incremental propagation of location information. It separates mobile handoff due to the air interface from routing handoff at the network layer. Such separation provides flexible tradeoffs between routing traffic and routing efficiency. Both mobile hosts and mobile support routers are able to control location propagation as route changes, in order to adapt to different requirements of applications and network management. By involving the home agent of a mobile host only in a routing handoff, it leads to a new mobile handoff procedure with a shorter delay. It offers better support for multicast from mobile hosts by control over location propagation and facilitates multicast to mobile hosts by a notion of potential group membership. The project includes the construction of a wireless network simulator and the implementation of a wireless network testbed. The simulator allows detailed performance studies and a deeper understanding of different alternatives for routing and mobility support in local as well as wide area wireless networks. The testbed offers an experimental tool for migrating existing applications to wireless networks and for gaining practical experiences of network communications on mobile hosts. Tools developed in this project will be incorporated into appropriate undergraduate and graduate courses. Transparent, flexible and efficient routing is critical to seamless network access by mobile hosts as they move between networks in vastly different environments. Insights gained in this project on routing support for mobile hosts will also shed light on building m obility-aware applications at higher levels.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Type Safe Program Generators</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This research project investigates the tight integration of program generation facilities into typed languages. Present program generation technology can be classified as either integrated with the language environment, as are macros in Lisp, or external to the language, as are yacc and lex for C. Within language-integrated generators, the taxonomy can be further refined into tightly-integrated generators, exemplified by reflective systems, and loosely-integrated generators, such as macro preprocessors. Tight integration of generators into typed languages gives rise to a number of problems to which solutions must be found. However, the benefits of increased expressiveness, efficiency, productivity, reusability, reliability, and quality makes research into solving these problems worthwhile. If the project is successful, it will provide a clearer semantics to a reflective ML-like language tailored for building generator systems, illustrate how such a reflective language can be restricted to maintain the invariants of strong typing, design a meta-programming system to prevent variable capture or design hiding, and build a programming environment where generated code can be seamlessly integrated with code produced in more traditional ways.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Lay Summary Principal Investigators: Gamlin, Twieg Proposal Number: IBN-l 9634422 Recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow researchers to investigate the functional activation of the brain that is associated with particular sensory, cognitive, and motor functions. To date, most of these functional MRI (fMRI) studies have been conducted at relatively low magnetic field strengths, but we can achieve higher resolutions using higher field strengths. Also, although a number of studies have investigated functional activation of the brain by various visual stimuli and during certain eye movements, few of these studies have attempted to confirm fixation accuracy or eye movement performance. This is a shortcoming of these studies, because if one is unsure that the subject is maintaining fixation or looking at the required target, it is hard to interpret the results of the experiment. Furthermore, in earlier studies, the optical systems did not permit the eyes to view high-resolution images. One aim of the research funded by this proposal is to establish a collaboration to solve technical problems that must be remedied to further understanding of how the human visual and eye movement systems operate. More specifically the aim is to develop and build a high-resolution optical and eye-tracking system to be used in a high-field MRI system. It is expected that the system developed through funding of this grant will be invaluable to all eye movement and vision-related fMRI studies, and will result in significant advances in our understanding of the workings of the human brain.</data>

Content for the base digital library will be drawn from the seven archival, manuscript, and museum repositories at UCLA. The development and testing of the DPA process model builds on the work of, and feeds into several educational and technological initiatives underway at UCLA, including cross-disciplinary collaborations with the Smithsonian Institution, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Special Collections at the UCLA University Research Library. This planning grant will generate: (1) generalizable processes for structuring digital libraries and enriching content descriptions that meet the needs of primary content creators, providers, and non-traditional users such as teachers and students; (2) knowledge of how teachers might select primary content and integrate it into classroom activities if it were digitally accessible; and (3) knowledge of how digitized primary sources might contribute to the enhancement of students&apos; understanding of, and engagement in, the health and natural sciences.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Multi-Modal Spatial Querying</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project investigates the use of two concurrent communication channels, graphics and speech, to achieve a successful interaction between a person and a geographic information system (GIS). The objective is to construct a multi-modal spatial query language in which users interact with a geographic database by drawing sketches of the desired configuration, while simultaneously talking about the spatial objects and the spatial relations drawn. This study will increase our understanding of multi-modal spatial interactions, and will lead to improved strategies for intelligent integration and processing of such multi-modal spatial queries in a GIS. The key to this interaction is the exploitation of complementary or redundant information present in both graphical and verbal descriptions of the same spatial scenes. A multiple-resolution model of spatial relations is used to capture the essential aspects of a sketch and its corresponding verbal description. The model stresses topological properties, such as containment and neighborhood, and considers metrical properties, such as distance and directions, as refinements where necessary. This model enables the retrieval of similar, not only exact, matches between a spatial query and a geographic database. Such new methods of multi-modal spatial querying and spatial similarity retrieval will empower experts as well as novice users to perform easier spatial searches, ultimately providing new user communities access to spatial databases.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">USC/ISI will create and maintain TRAIL, Testbed Routers for Advanced Internet Labs. The TRAIL software will be a freely available, well maintained, community research router source, featuring IPv6 in particular. The work will extend and leverage developments and facilities of the Collaborative Advanced Interagency Research Network (CAIRN), organized by ISI under current DARPA funding. CAIRN is a T1, DS-3 and OC-3 wide area router testbed. The software is for two classes of hardware: 1) high performance but low-cost personal computers, supporting small numbers of router interfaces and 2) specialized router hardware, supporting the large numbers of interfaces that are characteristic of internet interconnect points, and providing a realistic experimental model of commercial IP routing technology. For the second class of hardware, one vendor who supports such numbers of high-speed interfaces proved interested in donating full source code to be used as the base of TRAIL. Therefore, the second class of hardware for TRAIL is the Ascend/Netstar, Gigarouter. It supports 32 OC-3 ATM ports, or combinations of ATM ports with 16 to 128 fast ethernet ports. The proposal focuses strongly on support of experimental users. ISI&apos;s care will be devoted to supporting their software, and maintaining and distributing versions for PC alone, and for PC along with Gigarouter. ISI will also maintain facilities for IPv6 networking research collaboration, and coordinate the North American portion of the experimental IPv6 backbone, the &quot;6bone&quot;.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Logical and Stochastic Approaches to Mismatch Resolution in Machine Translation</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">A major bottleneck in present-day machine translation (MT) is identifying appropriate approximations when no exact translation exists between the source and target languages. An MT system must resolve mismatches either by incorporating implicit information from context or leaving out some information in the source text. A prototype MT system is implemented, incorporating the usual MT steps, analysis (analyzing English sources into an English-oriented semantic representation), transfer (transferring the English-oriented semantics into a Japanese-oriented semantics), and generation (building Japanese targets from the transferred semantics), and adding a novel Mismatch Resolution Module (MRM) called when generation fails. In this architecture, both analysis and generation modules are purely monolingual, and transfer is simplistic, incorporating minimal context information, and the bulk of mismatch resolution and disambiguation is done in the generation-MRM loop, where the MRM offers solutions to the problems encountered by generation. Two kinds of MRMs are explored, logical and statistical, with the design goal of a single MRM combining the advantages of both approaches. Translations are evaluated by monolingual English speakers applying evaluation measures modeled on those of the DARPA MT program. The focus is on translating the Japanese joint venture business articles in the MUC-5 corpus into English. This project attacks the crucial mismatch resolution problem with a novel architecture, logical and statistical techniques, and on-line text resources.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goals of this project are to address some of the barriers that limit accessibility and prevent widespread use of spoken language technology. In particular, the lack of portability of today&apos;s technology means that application development requires significant engineering for each new task. As a result, the high cost and level of expertise entailed restrict research and development activities to a handful of specialized laboratories. A partnership with the Universidad de las Americas, Puebla has been established to address this portability issue. Through a program of collaborative research and technology transfer, we are developing an integrated toolkit for learning about, researching and developing spoken language systems in both English and Spanish languages. This involves creating suitable infrastructure, language resources and teaching materials, as well as performing basic research to improve on the technology underlying the toolkit. The results of this work will benefit large numbers of people. We plan to distribute the resulting toolkit and resources by making them available at no cost to academic institutions throughout the United States and Mexico. This, in turn, will promote interest and understanding into spoken language technology by allowing people to rapidly design, build and experiment with spoken language systems.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Compiler infrastructure is a key and enabling component of cutting-edge computing systems research. Whether the research is focusing on developing new optimization algorithms, designing a new programming language, creating new software tools, developing and analyzing real-time systems, or exploring new or experimental architectural features, a complete, robust, and flexible compilation system is required to perform realistic experiments in a timely fashion. This research project will develop a compiler infrastructure, called Zephyr, to meet the current and future needs of computing system researchers. The leitmotiv of Zephyr&apos;s organization is the separation of the representation or form of Zephyr&apos;s intermediate languages from their content. Decoupling the content of an intermediate language from its representation permits researchers to use an intermediate language most appropriate for their needs, to extend an existing intermediate language, or to develop a new HIL, yet still use Zephyr infrastructure and leverage off the efforts of other research groups also using the infrastructure.</data>
