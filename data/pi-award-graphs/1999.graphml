      <data key="e_abstract">This is a proposal from American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to hold a workshop to capture community input and to produce a publicly available report summarizing visions as to the future of NSF&apos;s Advanced Network Infrastructure programs following the present vBNS generation. This is an essential part of the NSF planning process and the information gathered and published will be extremely helpful to NSF and the R&amp;E community at large. The Advanced Network Infrastructure program has a number of important constituent groups that should be consulted as a part of a post-vBNS planning activity. These groups include at least the following sectors: university CIOs and administrators, the general science and university research community, the computer and networking science research community, industry, and those involved with the Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (PACI). This AAAS proposal will allow us to cover the general science and university research community.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this project is to help expert problem solvers find needed information in a large, complex information space. The focus is on one example of expert problem solving; the health care field. Sorting through such a heterogeneous collection of electronic and other media materials to find needed information, sometimes under time duress can be formidable. This project proposes to capture the trace of information used by experts - to monitor the paths taken and collection resources used by, in this case physicians, in moving from observation, to information gathering, to solution of a given health care problem. By capturing the artifactual trace information associated with information seeking and selection, it is hypothesized that greater insight can be gained into behaviors of users and patterns of usage. This knowledge can then be fed-back into the design and development of new information environments. The work will be conducted by a cross-disciplinary team comprised of an MD focusing on information seeking behaviors of physicians, and a group of computer scientists focussing on extracting and using regulary structured information. The usefulness of the approaches will be tested in domains other than health care, in particular the aircraft design industry through the active support of the Boeing Corporation.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Tracking Footprints Through an Information Space: Leveraging the Document Selections of Expert Problem Solvers</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this project is to help expert problem solvers find needed information in a large, complex information space. The focus is on one example of expert problem solving; the health care field. Sorting through such a heterogeneous collection of electronic and other media materials to find needed information, sometimes under time duress can be formidable. This project proposes to capture the trace of information used by experts - to monitor the paths taken and collection resources used by, in this case physicians, in moving from observation, to information gathering, to solution of a given health care problem. By capturing the artifactual trace information associated with information seeking and selection, it is hypothesized that greater insight can be gained into behaviors of users and patterns of usage. This knowledge can then be fed-back into the design and development of new information environments. The work will be conducted by a cross-disciplinary team comprised of an MD focusing on information seeking behaviors of physicians, and a group of computer scientists focussing on extracting and using regulary structured information. The usefulness of the approaches will be tested in domains other than health care, in particular the aircraft design industry through the active support of the Boeing Corporation.</data>

      <data key="e_title">MATLAB Extensions and Compiler Techniques for High-Performance Computing</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">MATLAB has become the most popular rapid prototyping language for&lt;br/&gt;scientific computing. Highlevel mathematical languages like MATLAB&lt;br/&gt;dramatically simplify program development. Unfortunately, this&lt;br/&gt;simplification often has come at the expense of efficient implementation.&lt;br/&gt;Today, MATLAB programs are usually interpreted on sequential machines.&lt;br/&gt;Thus, the performance of these programs suffers in comparison with Fortran&lt;br/&gt;programs compiled on parallel high-performance computers. The objective of&lt;br/&gt;this project is to develop and evaluate language extensions, run-time&lt;br/&gt;libraries, and tools for compiling MATLAB and similar interactive languages&lt;br/&gt;for efficient execution on classes of target machines ranging from&lt;br/&gt;uniprocessor workstations to highly-parallel distributed systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical thrust of this project is to develop restructuring compiler&lt;br/&gt;technology that will enable the translation of MATLAB codes into sequential&lt;br/&gt;or parallel object code that is competitive with handwritten code produced&lt;br/&gt;by skillful FORTRAN programmers. The work will build on previous work by&lt;br/&gt;the investigators and will take advantage of existing software modules from&lt;br/&gt;the Falcon system (developed at Illinois). The compiler will accept&lt;br/&gt;parallel extensions and will be able to automatically translate sequential&lt;br/&gt;MATLAB loops into parallel form. The compiler will transform the code to&lt;br/&gt;enhance locality and generate efficient sparse code from dense&lt;br/&gt;computations. This transformation is necessary because MATLAB codes usually&lt;br/&gt;represent sparse computations in dense form. The investigators will also&lt;br/&gt;consider incorporating some of the compiler modules into the interpreter&lt;br/&gt;for just-in-time restructuring.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9731294&lt;br/&gt;Plummer&lt;br/&gt;The National Nanofabrication Users Network (NNUN) was established by NSF in 1994 as a partnership of advanced user facilities providing the national research and development community with access to state-of-the-art micro- and nanofabrication facilities, instrumentation, processes, and expertise. The Network is composed of a consortium of five universities: Cornell University, Stanford University, University of California at Santa Barbara, Howard University, and Pennsylvania State University. The NNUN is supported by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG ), Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), Biological Sciences (BIO), and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NNUN&apos;s mission is to provide opportunities for the nation&apos;s scientists, engineers and educators to move innovative ideas in nano-scale science and technology to the laboratory to develop prototype structures, devices and systems. The network serves a broad and diverse engineering and scientific community in academia, industry and government, and is committed to education, training and technical outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experimental activities carried out at the NNUN facilities impact a wide range of scientific and technical fields including biology, chemistry, physics, electronics, magnetics, superconductivity, materials, MEMS, nanostructures, and optics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NNUN facilities are hands-on user facilities where researchers, with minimal training, can perform individual state-of-the-art projects with tools otherwise inaccessible to them. Research activities undertaken at NNUN may range in duration from a day or so, to an extended period of time. In some cases, research projects can be undertaken remotely, with NNUN personnel assisting with fabrication processes for network users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under new 5-year Cooperative Agreements, NNUN will continue to operate as five university nodes and will enhance the capability and infrastructure to support an increasing number of external users in traditional and in emerging new fields that are impacted by micro- and nanofabrication. The NNUN will continue to support and enhance its mission in the integration of research and education through the training of students, outreach activities and topical workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The URL is http://www.nnun.org/ to obtain information about the National Nanofabrication Users Network.&lt;br/&gt;***</data>

      <data key="e_title">Automatic Reference Librarians for the World Wide Web</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">By all accounts, the Web is humanity&apos;s largest and fastest growing repository of digital information. Many collections of information are Internet-accessible, and most will provide a searchable Web interface. While some collections have a broad array of materials, trends show an explosion in the number of specialized&lt;br/&gt;collections with narrow but very deep content. Thus a principle challenge facing users will be the selection of Web information sources capable of answering their query. In a physical library, users rely on a reference librarian to help point them at the correct resource, but while human librarians are becoming increasingly&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated in their use of the Web, they are only part of the solution. We need more powerful automatic reference tools to help people efficiently retrieve high quality information from the Web. Typically, reference librarians are not specialists in the topic of inquiry (e.g., computational fluid dynamics) but they are expert at identifying relevant resources (e.g., The International Journal of Fluid Dynamics) and at appropriate strategies for obtaining the necessary information. The central objective of this proposal is to create software agents that posses reference intelligence --- a limited understanding of complex technical topics, but a very sophisticated understanding of how and where to find high-quality information on the World Wide Web.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Czech belongs to the family of Slavic languages, which exhibit phenomena that will prove challenging to speech recognition. The characteristics of a high degree of inflection, a high degree of derivation, a relatively free word order, and having phones that appear in no other language make speech recognition difficult. The development of a large vocabulary speaker independent continuous speech recognizer for Czech is proposed as a collaborative effort between Johns Hopkins&apos; Center for Language and Speech Processing and three university teams from the Czech Republic. The proposed research is attempting to take advantage of the synergistic opportunities offered by the experience and tools of Johns Hopkins researchers, by the capabilities of the Czech partners, and by the existence of extensive text resources in their possession. The research cooperation will forge international scientific ties and create new centers of language engineering excellence outside the United States.</data>

To achieve this new science, a parallel processing cluster, consisting of thirty, two-way SMP Pentium II systems is to be assembled, together with multiple high speed networks, one of which supports the Virtual Interface Architecture for low processor overhead and high bandwidth. Commercial-grade message passing software (MPI) and scheduling software are used to provide a production environment under Windows NT immediately, in complement to the research experiments involving parallel processing that further enable the environment over time, including part-time Linux-based operation.</data>

The objective of this research is to apply state-of the art methodology in global optimization to several hard problems of scientific or engineering interest, and to develop, analyze, and implement new methodology which is capable of achieving a new level of performance on these and other complex applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on three areas: 1) structural biology problems, especially 3D virus reconstructions from x-ray scattering and cryo-electron microscopy data, 2) pattern classification for seismic oil exploration problems, and 3) system design and evaluation for nonlinear satellite communications links. These problems exhibit cost functions with multiple local minima and a wide variety of characteristics which complicate their optimization, including: a) cost functions that are driven by data that has a multi-scale structure, b) cost functions that are computed analytically but at great expense, c) cost functions that are computed by simulation or by a combination of analytical formulas and simulation (so-called semi-analytical simulation), and d) cost functions that are driven by changing data, where the global minimum must be tracked, possibly in real time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the work involves applying current global random search algorithms to get a baseline for the performance and computational characteristics of these methods which have not been studied extensively in the problem areas described above. The second part of the work will involve developing and analyzing algorithms with improved efficiency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the practicality of global optimization stems from the extraordinary (and still growing) computation resources that are now available. The most cost-effective resources are clusters of off-the-shelf computers. This research group has access to a leading edge machine of this type. Because local searches and simulations can be carried out in parallel with minimal communication overhead, the algorithms to be developed here are ideal candidates for implementation on such computers. Implementation efforts will be focused in this direction.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The ability to speak and understand language is probably the most intricate skill that people possess. It is certainly our most uniquely human ability. This project investigates how such an important skill is acquired and continues to develop throughout our lives. The resulting research findings will have applications in three areas: (1) the design of computer systems that can recognize and produce language, (2) the teaching of language skills, including reading, writing, and foreign language learning, and (3) the remediation of language disorders such as aphasia and dyslexia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The skills of language production and comprehension together comprise the language processing system, a complex system within the brain that turns thoughts into grammatical sequences of words and then articulates those words, and also understands the speech of others. The central claim of this project is that the language processing system is constantly changing. It adapts quickly to recent experience, while continuing to reflect the accumulated experience of a lifetime of speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Such adaptation, or learning, which usually occurs without any awareness, enables us to speak and comprehend effortlessly in the face of ever-changing situations. This perspective leads to two key research questions: (1) What learning mechanisms enable the language processing system to adapt swiftly and effectively to experience? (2) How can the study of learning tell us more about how the language processing system works?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The current project addresses these questions by investigating the comprehension and production of individual words as well as words combined into sentences. The research is multi-disciplinary, integrating the work of psychologists, linguists, and computer scientists. It involves experiments that measure how the abilities to speak and understand change with experience. For example, one set of experiments will determine how quickly children and adults can recognize a spoken word, as a function of how recently they have heard or said the same word before. More generally, the project&apos;s experiments involve measurement of the time it takes people to say or to recognize words, the kinds of errors that commonly occur during speech, and the patterns of eye movements and brain electrical activity that accompany word and sentence comprehension. The research is carried out on normal adults and children, and also on individuals with brain damage affecting their abilities to learn skills. The experimental work is combined with the development of computer models of the language processor that are capable of learning. These models, some of which will consist of artificial neural networks, will serve two functions. First, the models will instantiate theories of how people process language, and second, the models will offer insights into how machines can be designed to interact with people through language and speech.</data>

The resulting research findings will have applications in three areas: (1) the design of computer systems that can recognize and produce language, (2) the teaching of language skills, including reading, writing, and foreign language learning, and (3) the remediation of language disorders such as aphasia and dyslexia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The skills of language production and comprehension together comprise the language processing system, a complex system within the brain that turns thoughts into grammatical sequences of words and then articulates those words, and also understands the speech of others. The central claim of this project is that the language processing system is constantly changing. It adapts quickly to recent experience, while continuing to reflect the accumulated experience of a lifetime of speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Such adaptation, or learning, which usually occurs without any awareness, enables us to speak and comprehend effortlessly in the face of ever-changing situations. This perspective leads to two key research questions: (1) What learning mechanisms enable the language processing system to adapt swiftly and effectively to experience? (2) How can the study of learning tell us more about how the language processing system works?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The current project addresses these questions by investigating the comprehension and production of individual words as well as words combined into sentences. The research is multi-disciplinary, integrating the work of psychologists, linguists, and computer scientists. It involves experiments that measure how the abilities to speak and understand change with experience. For example, one set of experiments will determine how quickly children and adults can recognize a spoken word, as a function of how recently they have heard or said the same word before. More generally, the project&apos;s experiments involve measurement of the time it takes people to say or to recognize words, the kinds of errors that commonly occur during speech, and the patterns of eye movements and brain electrical activity that accompany word and sentence comprehension. The research is carried out on normal adults and children, and also on individuals with brain damage affecting their abilities to learn skills. The experimental work is combined with the development of computer models of the language processor that are capable of learning. These models, some of which will consist of artificial neural networks, will serve two functions. First, the models will instantiate theories of how people process language, and second, the models will offer insights into how machines can be designed to interact with people through language and speech.</data>

The Department will purchase computing and fabrication equipment which will be dedicated to support the aforementioned projects: Stratasys system, workstations, MotionStar motion capture system, etc. The goal of this research project is to build self-reconfiguring robotics systems at the mini and MEMS scale, and to develop a science-based for planning and controlling highly distributed reconfigurable robot systems. Mini and MEMS self-configuring robots that employ the principles of self-organization and self-assembly to combine structure with function will be designed and built. The equipment will be used for the research mentioned, including in particular: (1) developing self-configuring mini-robot systems; (2) developing massively parallel control algorithms for MEMS devices; (3) developing novel algorithms for distributed control of massively parallel reconfiguring robot systems; and (4) combining the results on massively-parallel micro-fabricated MEMS actuators and self-reconfiguring systems to design, fabricate, control and program self-reconfiguring micro-robot systems, built using MEMS technology. These advances in reconfigurable robotics science will greatly enhance the capabilities of distributed robot systems.</data>

The equipment will be used to continue and enhance the research projects listed and to support new projects between computer science and the Plasma Physics Laboratory. The first project, a collaboration between Computer Science and Astrophysics, deals with problems particularly challenging for parallel implementation due to the combination of interacting models and a highly irregular dynamic nature. The goals are to develop parallel algorithms and implementations for a range of computations, to develop generalizable and portable techniques preserving locality while providing load balance, to extend existing parallel languages; use runtime systems of these languages, to build libraries of partitioning techniques and&lt;br/&gt;algorithms. The second project, a collaboration between CS and the School of Medicine at Stanford University, with similar goals, simulates inherently slow processes in structural biology. The last project will broaden the set of workloads available. The SPLASH suites of parallel applications in critical emerging application areas serve as benchmarks for architectural studies, as well as testbeds for programming languages and compilers.</data>

Thus, to support the aforementioned projects, this award contributes to the purchase of several Compaq Alpha machines connected by four 8-port 1.2 Gigabit/sec Myrinet switches, with 21 GBytes of main memory and 110 GBytes of disk space. The software platform consists of the Linux operating system, the message passing library for Myrinet hardware, and a basic network paging subsystem. Four research groups in the Computer Science&lt;br/&gt;Department at the State University of New York-Stony Brook will benefit from the massive amount of memory in the SAMSON server. 1. The Systems group will use SAMSON to develop advanced network memory services such as application-specific storage management, as well as to gather access characteristics of memory-intensive applications. 2. The Formal Verification group will use SAMSON to re-examine space/time tradeoffs in new and existing verification algorithms. 3. The XSB group will exploit the memory in SAMSON to further the advances of tabling techniques in Logic Programming. 4. The Graphics/Visualization group will investigate the interaction of multi-resolution rendering with the memory hierarchy in SAMSON. With SAMSON, the researchers will have access to an order of magnitude, more physical memory than is currently available, and will be able to experiment with regions of the design space that were not possible previously.</data>

The requested instrumentation enables three projects which require high-capacity machines with large memory and huge disk space: supporting customized multimedia presentations in distributed environments; multimedia data annotation, indexing and retrieval; and data mining and applications in large-scale multimedia databases. The first project establishes an underlying framework and develops techniques for ensuring consistent and robust retrieval, transmission and presentation of multimedia data. Experimental research will be conducted on concurrent presentations of heterogeneous multimedia data, robust end-to-end transmission protocols, incorporation of user interactions and delay effects in synchronizing strategies. The second project investigates the integration of text and photographic information in both the indexing and retrieval stages of a large-scale picture retrieval system. Experimental analysis will be conducted to demonstrate the utility of these techniques. The third project investigates multi-resolution clustering approaches on vast amount of multi-dimensional data generated from real-life images. The peformance of the clustering approaches will be studied and the effectiveness of these approaches will be demonstrated through different types of distributions of data.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9873520&lt;br/&gt;Bransford&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project combines insights from recent work in computer science, psychology and education to create and study &quot;teachable agent&quot; (TA) environments in mathematics and science that are motivating to students, intuitive to teachers and parents, and lead to high degrees of student learning. The hallmark of these environments is that students learn by instructing &quot;teachable agents&quot; who then venture forth in simulation-based exploratory environments and attempt to solve problems that require knowledge relevant to the disciplines of mathematics or science. If the agents have been taught properly they solve the problems; otherwise they need to be educated further. The simulation-based environments are carefully designed to focus attention on important concepts in science and mathematics, and to make explicit the errors that occur during problem solving. Students &quot;scout&quot; the problem solving requirements of various environments before attempting to teach their agents. Additional help and coaching agents are available to point students in the right direction when they make errors or produce sub-optimal solutions. The focus of the TA environments is on learning standards-based content in science and mathematics, not on learning to program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One key issue to be studied is how student learning is affected by opportunities to teach agents to prepare for particular sets of challenges. Also to be studied is how learning is influenced by the design of systems that vary in the degree to which they let students (a) &quot;scout&quot; to find problems that arise in the agents&apos; environments; (b) teach the agents with different representations and techniques; (c) measure the successfulness of their teaching by placing their agents in mini-assessment environments prior to engaging them in full-blown &quot;challenge environments&quot;; (d) receive different degrees and forms of feedback when their agents encounter difficulties; and (e) educate the personality, as well as the knowledge variables, relevant to learning, problem solving and collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project requires contributions from, and has important implications for, at least three disciplines: computer science, psychology, and education. The project has the potential to create new forms of assessment, and to transform popular video technologies into environments that help students learn important content. The quality and impact of the project will be enhanced through its association with the NSF-funded Center for Innovative Learning Technologies (CILT), whose mission is to foster collaboration among members of the education and technology community.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This is a three-year standard award. Recent advances in computing and telecommunications may have as much impact on multidisciplinary collaboration in science and industry as those technologies have had within business organizations and households. For instance, global networks make it possible to create project teams whose members include biologists, medical scientists, and managers in pharmaceutical firms. These changes may benefit from a better understanding of the requirements for successful multidisciplinary work, which often faces problems of both geographic and functional distance. Functional distance is a theoretical construct referring to a variety of cultural barriers to collaboration created by differences in norms, practices, and languages of differing disciplines or professions. This research will examine collaborations within and among disciplines using a variety of research strategies (e.g. interviews, citation analyses). A series of experiments will test hypotheses about the role of geographic and functional distance in the appropriation of ideas, privacy, attribution of credit, and productivity of collaborative projects. Finally, the PIs will develop and evaluate new computer applications for creating and supporting multidisciplinary collaborations. This research tackles a range of theoretical problems in the fields of social psychology, sociology, anthropology, and computer science. It will be important to science policy in describing how scientists organize their work in response to new technology, and more generally, in specifying the kinds of technology and management techniques that are required for successful teamwork and collaboration across time, space, and professional cultures and conditions. It will also aid in understanding how multidisciplinary work affects career patterns of scientists and professionals. Finally, the research will result in the development and test of usable computer-mediated communication technologies that help create and support collaborations.</data>

The requested support is &lt;br/&gt;for travel grants for participants and speakers, and support for the &lt;br/&gt;primary workshop social event. Past experience has shown that the &lt;br/&gt;travel grants are critical for many women who could not have attended &lt;br/&gt;otherwise. Based on the comments from women who have attended similar &lt;br/&gt;workshops organized by the Computing Research Association in the &lt;br/&gt;past, it is expected that this workshop will serve as a catalyst for &lt;br/&gt;positive and important changes in participant&apos;s lives.</data>

This equipment facilitates research on several research projects in Computer and Information Science and Engineering, including, in particular, the aforementioned projects. The first project will provide adaptive QoS since the network conditions are likely to be time-varying. The second project will extend prior work on IP address and port-number-based-service replication in fixed networks to deal with mobility and higher application level service replication. The third project is a sense-making process&lt;br/&gt;where information is discussed and manipulated until agreement is reached. It includes capturing emergent understandings and enabling incremental formalization, recognizing implicit structure within informally presented information, suggesting and automating formalization, aiding the development of shared languages, and improving understanding of knowledge building processes. The last project seeks to address packet losses due to wireless errors, hand-off, and route change in an end-to-end manner, rather than involving switches or routers, etc. These research projects are designed to advance the state of the art in areas related to wireless networking and collaborative knowledge building.

The cameras and motion capture equipment will capture full body and facial motion of the users. The processing power of the graphics workstations and other available&lt;br/&gt;multi-processors will be used to create data-driven models for recognition and generation of human actions ranging from full body motions such as a tennis swing to subtle facial expressions. The power of this technology will be demonstrated by constructing interactive environments in which the cameras and motion capture equipment will be used for on-line recognition of user actions and the graphics workstation will be used to animate human figures in real-time, based on the models derived off-line. The prototype applications will be environments where interactivity and realism are key, such as training environments for physical tasks and animation of highly interactive and responsive characters.</data>

The first project will develop a hypermedia engine to automatically generate hypermedia links and navigation. This approach contributes especially by serving systems which dynamically generate their display contents, the most&lt;br/&gt;common case in business and engineering analysis applications. The second project will develop theory, tools and techniques for distributed decision support utilizing the World Wide Web. This project is an integrated program of theory building, software tool development and assessment, and empirical studies (both controlled experiments and field studies). The third project extends the existing Virtual Classroom program to produce a &quot;Virtual University.&quot; Research components include semi-structured interviews with faculty and selected students, and field experiments to isolate the influence of specific factors on outcomes. The last project will develop a set of powerful tools designed to support learning communities. The tools will be pilot tested with classes of graduate students, refined, and assessed further through field trials with professional societies and other scholarly communities. The equipment will create a development lab and two&lt;br/&gt;experimentation labs for these projects.</data>

The classroom will have seats, containing power and network distribution, equipped with a pen-based annotation surface; the meeting room will contain large electronic whiteboard surfaces, both upright and horizontal, providing group-level interaction. The annotation system consist of a high-resolution video tablet from Mutoh, driven by a PC/104+ embedded computer attached to the student/meeting table. This project provides infrastructure for interactive pen-based computing equipment which is dedicated to support research in computer and information science and engineering in the area of capture and retrieval of everyday experiences. The research projects respectively include: augmenting the capture of university lectures to&lt;br/&gt;include student note-taking and collaboration, in which lecture experiences are preserved and made available for later review; automated understanding of capture experiences, in which computational perception and machine learning techniques are applied to interpret the semantics behind captured activities in different domains; automated capture of software architectural rationale, in which an interactive whiteboard provides a more natural surface for creating and capturing software design discussion about the high-level organization of complex software systems; and strategic meeting room tools, in which integrated large format interactive surfaces allow for the capture and dissemination of informal and strategic information.</data>

      <data key="e_title">CISE Research Instrumentation: Augmenting the Capture and Understanding of Everyday Experiences</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">9818305&lt;br/&gt;Abowd, Gregory D.&lt;br/&gt;Atkeson, Christopher&lt;br/&gt;Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Augmenting the Capture and Understanding of Everyday Experiences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research instrumentation enables research projects in:&lt;br/&gt;- Ubiquitous Computing: The Capture, Integration, and Access Problem,&lt;br/&gt;- Automated Understanding of Captures Experience,&lt;br/&gt;- Automated Capture of Software Architectural Rationale, and&lt;br/&gt;- Command Post of the Future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To support the aforementioned projects, this award contributes to outfit a classroom and a meeting room, providing embedded capture work surfaces, at the College of Computing in Georgia Institute of Technology. The classroom will have seats, containing power and network distribution, equipped with a pen-based annotation surface; the meeting room will contain large electronic whiteboard surfaces, both upright and horizontal, providing group-level interaction. The annotation system consist of a high-resolution video tablet from Mutoh, driven by a PC/104+ embedded computer attached to the student/meeting table. This project provides infrastructure for interactive pen-based computing equipment which is dedicated to support research in computer and information science and engineering in the area of capture and retrieval of everyday experiences. The research projects respectively include: augmenting the capture of university lectures to&lt;br/&gt;include student note-taking and collaboration, in which lecture experiences are preserved and made available for later review; automated understanding of capture experiences, in which computational perception and machine learning techniques are applied to interpret the semantics behind captured activities in different domains; automated capture of software architectural rationale, in which an interactive whiteboard provides a more natural surface for creating and capturing software design discussion about the high-level organization of complex software systems; and strategic meeting room tools, in which integrated large format interactive surfaces allow for the capture and dissemination of informal and strategic information.</data>

The GPN will connect ARKnet2 to its gigaPOP&lt;br/&gt;in Kansas City and will provide access to the vBNS and federal agency&lt;br/&gt;networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research supported by the resulting network access includes: seismic&lt;br/&gt;analysis, nanodimensional molecular device modeling, combustion analysis&lt;br/&gt;and computational fluid dynamics, microscopy and biotechnology advances,&lt;br/&gt;fetal magnetoencephalography, and studies of physiological effects of&lt;br/&gt;microgravity. Collaborations will involve facilities and universities&lt;br/&gt;including: NASA Johnson Space Center, University of Florida, University of&lt;br/&gt;Tennessee, Old Dominion University, Yale, Louisiana State University,&lt;br/&gt;Temple University, and Argonne National Laboratory.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Statistical Analysis of Interconnect-Limited Systems II</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project is developing a mathematical framework based on Renormalization Group (RG) theory that is capable of predicting the geometrical structure of very densely wired and optimized networks without recourse to empirical fitting parameters. The power of the RG technique is that it is not a descriptive theory but rather a general method for constructing theories. It is therefore capable of analyzing a wide range of interconnect analysis problems ranging from wire placement to cross-talk. It succeeds by successively renormalizing wire arrangements, reducing a strongly coupled, multiple-length scale problem to a large number of much simpler single-length scale problems. The research activities being carried out under this grant include: (a) the identification of so-called critical points in the design parameters of processing chips which indicate a transition from easily scaleable designs to unscaleable designs, (b) the development of algorithms to move these critical points to positions which make previously unscaleable designs scaleable, (c) to relate the theory of optimized interconnect geometries to the more general and universal physics of critical point systems which include magnets, boiling water, and percolation.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This research investigates new, efficient, and highly optimized solutions to large-scale IC placement under tight timing constraints. The focus of this project is to investigate the feasibility of applying recently&lt;br/&gt;developed numerical algorithms, such as the fast multipole method for large-scale particle simulation and the interior-point method for non-linear programming to solving the large-scale constrained circuit&lt;br/&gt;placement problem. Key elements of studies in this project include (i) direct handling of timing and non-overlapping constraints in a mathematical programming formulation; (ii) an hierarchical model of the problem allowing smooth approximations to non-smooth and discrete constraints; (iii) fast multipole expansions to accelerate evaluation of the constraints and their derivatives; (iv) fast numerical solution to KKT-based systems of linear equations used to calculate search directions in the optimization.</data>

The funds will contribute to the purchase of a Sun Enterprise 250, some Sun Ultra 5&apos;s, and the supporting networking software facilities. The computational techniques in the first project will be used to handle data mining problems in time series, where the data is not geometric in nature, but solutions involve geometric structures and algorithms and in spatial data mining, where the data itself is geometric in nature. Specific problems include similarity measure and searching in time series, and proximity and clustering problems in spatial data mining. The second project focuses on investigating immunological principles in designing a multi-agent system for network intrusion detection. The immune agents roam around the nodes of the network and monitor the situation, mutually recognize each other&apos;s activities, and produce specific action, while learning and adapting to its environment dynamically. The third project explores techniques such as query information and automatically adjusting features to enable the indexing to respond to change more appropriately.

      <data key="e_abstract">9820275&lt;br/&gt;GUPTA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrologic Sciences, as a distinct, new, interdisciplinary Geoscience, was conceived in 1991 in a report of the National Research Council called &quot;Opportunities in Hydrologic Sciences&quot;. A new initiative by the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) called GEO-2000 offers a unique opportunity for the broad hydrology community to take steps to develop a comprehensive, long ten-n plan which can serve as a basis to enhance base funding in hydrologic sciences at NSF. Simultaneously, this plan would provide a basis for taking stock of ma or accomplishments and advancements which would result from an enhanced funding base, and identifying future needs. This proposal addresses how such a plan can be developed and implemented within a broad scientific framework involving three steps. The first step is to prepare a &apos;concept paper&apos; or a &apos;science plan&apos;. The second step is to organize a small workshop in which the science plan will serve as a discussion document. The workshop will send its &apos;initial recommendations&apos; to GEO by February 28, 1999. The third step is to widely publicize the outcome of the first two steps, and seek input from the broad national and international hydrology community. This third step will serve as the basis for making appropriate revisions into initial recommendations, preparing a set of &apos;revised recommendations&apos; for the &apos;GEO-2000 report&apos; by the fall of 1999, and making plans for future action items beyond GEO-2000.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Cosmological phase transitions can be a copious source of topological defects. The same happens in condensed matter systems, and experiments on these systems can help in determining the mechanism for defect formation. The similarities between the superfluid transitions in liquid helium and cosmological models containing topological defects is especially strong. As a result, in recent years there has been considerable activity to simulate phase transitions of the early universe using liquid He-3 and &lt;br/&gt;He-4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous experiments in both He-3 and He-4 have shown that defects, in this case vortices, are indeed created, and that the vortex line density is consistent with estimates based on the mechanism proposed by Zurek, now known as the Kibble-Zurek (K-Z) mechanism. This mechanism makes specific predictions about the scaling of the vortex line density with a) the rate at which the transition takes place and b) the amplitude of the correlation length of the order parameter. In earlier experiments there was little control over the former, while the latter, determined solely by the fluid, could not be changed appreciably either. Prof. Mulder&apos;s group will carry out a new experiment, operating close to the tricritical point in He-3 and He-4 mixtures, will have the ability to change both over a wide range. This should result in a definitive test of the K-Z mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly supported by the Division of Physics, the Division of Materials Research and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.</data>

Thus, the study of ambiguity resolution in each of the four research projects using the Cognitive Robot will be enhanced by its integration with the ambiguity resolution capabilities of the others. Since the human capability for effortlessly resolving ambiguity seems to be a fundamental aspect of intelligence, an explication of the interactions among the ambiguity resolution capabilities of these subsystems may be highly significant.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The confluence of computing and communication has produced an explosion of network-based applications. Numerous examples can be drawn from web-based applications, interactive simulations, gaming,&lt;br/&gt;visualization, and collaborative environments. Current approaches to the development of network-based applications are still based on a CPU-centric model using node architectures optimized for uniprocessor&lt;br/&gt;or small-scale multiprocessor applications. This can lead to significant inefficiencies for distributed applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores an architecture for the support of emerging network-based applications whereby selected application-level computations are executed within network interfaces (NIs). The focus is on&lt;br/&gt;networks of workstations (NOW) that have emerged as a viable high performance computational vehicle. Within this context the project will support applications with substantial computation and data manipulation&lt;br/&gt;requirements. Such high performance programs are drawn from three different application domains: scientific simulation, computer vision and image processing, and computer graphics. The unique aspect of the&lt;br/&gt;approach to supporting these classes of programs is the use of extensible network interfaces, where extension concerns programs executed both on the low cost microprocessors resident on NIs and on additional, programmable and NI-associated hardware in the form of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Specifically, the project will demonstrate (1) the use of FPGAs to implement data-intensive&lt;br/&gt;computations and (2) the use of the NIs&apos; microprocessors to handle associated meta-information and perform computationally non-intensive operations best performed &quot;close&quot; to the network. Extensibility for NIs will be attained by development of a flexible and extensible virtual communication machine. The project refers to such enhanced networks as Active System Area Networks (ASANs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key research issues are (1) to understand and demonstrate an ASAN&apos;s ability to perform selected computations and services more efficiently than host CPUs and to explore the effects and trade-offs of off-loading certain functionality from host CPUs to the ASAN, (2) to develop the programming model that enables the efficient and application-specific use of the ASAN&apos;s computational resources, and (3) to create an ASAN software architecture that is low overhead and easily extensible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach to the proposed research is experimental. It includes construction of a testbed, implementation of selected NI extensions for use by the three classes of parallel/distributed applications investigated in this work and performance evaluation of the resulting system/application performance. Successful demonstration of the&gt;approach will have a major impact the way future multimedia network applications are designed, optimized, and supported.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Baumslag&lt;br/&gt;9973233&lt;br/&gt; The principal investigator and his colleagues continue&lt;br/&gt;developing the software package Magnus, which has been designed&lt;br/&gt;to carry out computations in and experiments with, in the main,&lt;br/&gt;finitely presented groups. This software has been set up so that&lt;br/&gt;it can be used remotely, via the internet. This means that&lt;br/&gt;researchers world-wide can use the software by logging on to the&lt;br/&gt;Magnus server. The project uses Internet-based facilities to&lt;br/&gt;maintain a list of outstanding open problems and to set up&lt;br/&gt;several discussion groups focusing on related mathematical areas.&lt;br/&gt;These support collaboratory interactions among users, including&lt;br/&gt;researchers in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and&lt;br/&gt;China. Software development includes the introduction of genetic&lt;br/&gt;algorithms as well as measures to allow users to add their own&lt;br/&gt;routines to Magnus, extending the scope of the tool. The&lt;br/&gt;investigators also use Magnus to study problems in pure group&lt;br/&gt;theory and in commutative algebra. The project includes the&lt;br/&gt;training of students.&lt;br/&gt; In mathematics, group theory aims to capture and study the&lt;br/&gt;essence of symmetry, particularly in patterns. Such patterns&lt;br/&gt;occur frequently in nature, for instance as crystals. Its&lt;br/&gt;connection with symmetry makes group theory important in physics,&lt;br/&gt;in biology, and in the study of our physical world, as well as in&lt;br/&gt;geometry and other mathematical fields such as the theory of&lt;br/&gt;computation and cryptography. The investigators&apos; goal in this&lt;br/&gt;project is to build an easy-to-use computational tool that makes&lt;br/&gt;it possible for a user to carry out experiments and solve&lt;br/&gt;problems about the most ubiquitous of the mathematical objects&lt;br/&gt;involved here, the so-called finitely presented groups. These are&lt;br/&gt;groups that can be described completely by a finite set of rules;&lt;br/&gt;examples include the group of rigid geometric motions of an&lt;br/&gt;object and the groups of quantum mechanics. The computational&lt;br/&gt;tool, Magnus, has a simple but limited interface. Nevertheless,&lt;br/&gt;Magnus has already been used to explore and solve a number of&lt;br/&gt;difficult problems in group theory. The present project focuses&lt;br/&gt;on algorithmic developments and techniques to allow users to add&lt;br/&gt;their own routines to Magnus, extending the scope of the tool.&lt;br/&gt;The project also provides Internet-accessible computation and&lt;br/&gt;information resources in a collaboratory setting, fostering&lt;br/&gt;Internet-based interchanges and collaborations among researchers.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the project helps train students in both computation and&lt;br/&gt;mathematics.</data>

Levy Collection of Sheet Music and similar collections located elsewhere. The Eisenhower Library previously digitized this collection of more than 29,000 pieces of American popular sheet music spanning the years 1780 to 1960. The sheet music in this collection provides a social commentary on American life and a distinctive record of&lt;br/&gt;their time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will create sound renditions and enhanced search capabilities for the collection. Audio files and full-text lyrics are being created using optical music recognition software written by staff from the Peabody Conservatory at Hopkins. Workflow managing tools will be developed to reduce and focus human labor. The activities will result in a tested process, framework, and set of tools transferable for use with other large-scale digitization projects.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">As information technologies are becoming important tools in schools and in mainstream society, families and schools will bear an important responsibility to assist young people in gaining the moral reasoning, motivation, and control to engage in ethical behavior while using these new technologies. The objective of the proposed study is to investigate how high school students analyze issues related to the ethical use of information and communication technologies, including the Internet. The study will examine ethical issues pertaining to copyright infringement, computer security violations (hacking), disrespectful speech (flaming, harassment, violation of privacy), and accessing or publishing potentially harmful material (pornography and hate literature). The study will seek to determine the factors that influence students&apos; analyses of scenarios that describe inappropriate acts, such as students&apos; developmental characteristics, life situations (gender, amount of computer use), knowledge of the law, the nature of the act (type of victim or amount of harm), and the reasoning process that students engage in, in making their determinations. Knowledge gained through the study will provide the basis for the development of effective environmental, instructional, and intervention strategies to assist students in gaining the moral reasoning, motivation, and control to engage in ethical behavior while using new technologies. The subjects for the research will be 200 high school students who have had Internet access through home or school for a period of at least one year. The study will make use of three standardized measurement instruments for the measurement of cognitive-moral development, empathic tendencies, and self-understanding. An information technology ethics questionnaire will be developed for the purposes of this study. The questionnaire will be designed to investigate various aspects of students&apos; evaluation of the appropriateness of the acts that involve the use of information technologies, their knowledge of rules, and their reasoning process. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be gathered through the questionnaire. The analysis of the data will reveal potential relationships between cognitive moral development, empathic tendencies, self-understanding and the subjects&apos; analysis of various information technology-related acts.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project will study the design and implementation of congestion-sensitive pricing schemes for the Internet. Pricing is &gt;viewed as a tool to achieve economic objectives as well as a complementary instrument to existing traffic management techniques to achieve provisioning and congestion control objectives. The work is based upon Internet pricing concepts such as expected capacity and smart markets, and will focus on the differentiated-services framework (a new Internet standard) for its implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The schemes designed will be broadly based upon the economic concept of contracting. The central hypothesis in our framework is that a network could, based upon congestion monitoring mechanisms, raise prices and vary contract terms dynamically. The project will investigate a range of mechanisms including soft (short-term) contracts, bidding models for receiver-initiated services, usage-based or flat prices for excess traffic, and congestion-sensitive update of prices. An important objective of the project is to develop schemes that can be readily implemented in the differentiated services architecture, without need for additional standardization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will collaborate to investigate specific issues arising in their areas of expertise: a) traffic management mechanisms in the Internet, and b) information systems (IS) and economic underpinnings&lt;br/&gt;of pricing mechanisms. The pricing schemes and demand models derived in this framework will be integrated into detailed packet-level network simulations to study the combined impact of these technical and economic control techniques.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9907441&lt;br/&gt;Akasofu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Computer-Assisted Translation of Alaska Native Languages (CATANAL) Project is designed to explore the application of computational linguistics, machine translation, speech recognition and optical character recognition to the translation and preservation of Alaska Native languages. The urgent need to preserve and translate the Alaska Native languages derives from a number of problems in the social and natural sciences, as well as educational, political, and economic problems caused by powerful forces that are shaping events in the Arctic at the turn of the millennium. This project will develop a succinct statement of the most important needs in translation and preservation of the Native Languages and what role computational linguistics can play in addressing these problems. This project will support a workshop involving parties interested in this problem. The workshop is planned for May 19-22, 1999 at the new International Arctic Research Center (IARC) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF). The workshop has been preceded by organizational and steering committee activities. Following the workshop a report will be produced and disseminated. This project is jointly supported with a number of organizations in the State of Alaska.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIS-9817473&lt;br/&gt;Chen , Hsinchun &lt;br/&gt;University of Arizona&lt;br/&gt;$166,666 - 12 mos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DLI Phase 2: High-Performance Digital Library Classification Systems: From Information Retrieval to Knowledge Management&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award. The proposed research aims to develop an architecture and the associated techniques needed to automatically generate classification systems from large domain-specific textual collections and to unify them with manually created classification systems to assist in effective digital library retrieval and analysis. Both algorithmic developments and user evaluation in several sample domains will be conducted in this project. Scalable automatic clustering methods including Ward&apos;s clustering, multi-dimensional scaling, latent semantic indexing, and self-organizing map will be developed and compared. Most of these algorithms, which are computationally intensive, will be optimized based on the sparsity of common keywords in textual document representations. Using parallel,&lt;br/&gt;high-performance platforms as a time machine for simulation, we plan to parallellize and benchmark the above clustering algorithms for large-scale collections (on the order of millions of documents) in several domains. Results of these automatic classification systems will be represented using several novel hierarchical display methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The testbed of research will include three application domains that consist of both large-scale collections and existing classification systems: (1) medicine: CancerLit (700,000 cancer abstracts) and the NLM&apos;s UMLS (500,000 medical concepts), (2) geoscience: GeoRef and Petroleum Abstracts (800,000 abstracts) and Georef thesaurus (26,000 geoscience terms), and (3) Web application: a WWW collection (1.5M web pages) and the Yahoo! classification (20,000 categories). Medical subjects, geo scientists, and WWW search engine users will be used in the evaluation plan.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIS-9817572 &lt;br/&gt;Palakal, Mathew &lt;br/&gt;Indiana University&lt;br/&gt;$101,604 - 12 mos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DLI Phase 2: A Distributed Information Filtering System for Digital Libraries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award. The proposed research is aimed at designing and developing a distributed intelligent information distribution and filtering system that provides personalized information services to the user while minimizing direct user involvement. The system is intended to traverse the internet to retrieve the most relevant information of interest to the user. Information filtering will be realized using a information agents, and will involve integration of advanced concepts and techniques from the domains of artificial intelligence, information retrieval, and distributed object computing. The agents will contain models of network-based dynamic information resources and will have the capability to learn changing patterns of an individual user&apos;s interest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four key basic research areas to be addressed are: methods for adapting various knowledge structures associated with an agent &lt;br/&gt;new and robust agent architectures &lt;br/&gt;agent collaboration protocols based on a natural or artificial economic framework &lt;br/&gt;agent-driven information service operations</data>

This project is focussing on developing the foundations of a scalable, broad-based, interdisciplinary digital library for the humanities. The principal investigators for this project include not only humanists but also specialists in computer-human interface design and in cognitive science. The goals are to both to improve the ways that humanists can perform their intellectual work and to design materials that are more accessible to the vastly expanded audience already reached by the World Wide Web. Digital libraries allow us to improve traditional teaching and learning; they also challenge us to redefine the relationship between the humanities and society as a whole. To achieve the goals, new document models must be developed to serve a more complex audience and which are designed to interact at various levels in diverse human and electronic contexts; that is, as part of a scalable, integrated digital library that can be maintained over time. Building on twelve years of development with the Greco-Roman world, the project team will create a digital library that includes a wide range of materials, ranging from ancient Egypt through nineteenth century London.</data>

Topics covered include CAD tools; hardware-software co-design; architecture simulation (functional and behavioral); verification of functionality, timing, and communication protocols; optimizing compilers; and operating systems. Additionally, the idea of fostering design methodologies that encourage reuse of components&lt;br/&gt;not only at the physical or logic design levels but also at the functional levels will be explored. The workshop report includes: (1) a statement of the most pressing problems to solve within the next decade, (2)&lt;br/&gt;recommendations regarding the style and kind of research to be conducted and suggestions to the community as to how to implement these recommendations.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Most children are not programmers but would like to create software that is similar to their favorite commercial applications, such as games and educational applications. Today&apos;s programming environments make this too difficult. The goals of this project are to study how children (fifth grade and older) reason about programming concepts, and then to create a new general-purpose programming language and environment for children that takes advantage of these findings. All aspects of the new system will be thoroughly analyzed with usability techniques such as Cognitive Dimensions and user tests with children. The language will be general-purpose, in that it will not be limited to creating a particular kind of program. It will be extensible, modular, scalable, and well-structured, so students can easily write programs that range from one line all the way up to many thousands of lines. Unlike most current environments for children, the system will support the creation of complete and sophisticated programs. The PI will exploit modern technologies to simplify the programming process, including direct manipulation and demonstrational techniques, programming environment technologies like structure editors, and mechanisms for extending programs by harnessing and reusing existing components. There has not been a successful new programming language for children in many years. Since the PI&apos;s system will be based on empirical studies of how children think, it should have an excellent chance of allowing the majority of children (and, by extension, the general public) to create interesting and useful applications&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~NatProg</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">In coherent imaging systems the transmitted and/or received coherent signals are spread over a spatially extended coherent aperture. Here, the definition of coherence relates to signals that exhibit a stationary phase relationship over the aperture. Coherent imaging uses an extended coherent aperture to enhance the resolution and reduce the signal to noise ratio of the desired images. Coherent apertures can either be continuous, such as a lens in an optical system, or discrete, spatially sampled apertures, often referred to as phased arrays. Some examples of phased array systems are electromagnetic-microwave surveillance and synthetic aperture imaging radars, and ultrasound transducers in medical ultrasound. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together a group of distinguished scientists and engineers from academia, government and industry for the purpose of exploring the role of advanced digital signal processing techniques in (discrete, spatially sampled) coherent imaging systems. The workshop will meet for two and a half days to assess and document current advances and recommend potential future research and development opportunities.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This award supports the use of agent-based models to study the emergence of multi-agent institutions in society and to test these models against data. The computational approach taken here departs from perfectly rational models in favor of boundedly rational models and non-equilibrium dynamics. The models are inherently concerned with social interactions and the ways in which institutions (and social norms and conformity effects) emerge out of those interactions. Five models will be developed including: the Long House Valley Anasazi from 800 AD to their disappearance in 1300 AD; crime rates; retirement decision-making; the distribution of firm sizes; and institutions of governance. These models will advance scientific knowledge about multi-agent systems, simulation and anthropology as well as contribute to policy-making about criminal, retirement and organizational behaviors.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The tremendous growth in demand for wireless communications capacity has created a need for new modulation, coding and detection methods that more efficiently use the multipath fading channels encountered in mobile radio. Since the channel changes rapidly, the transmitter and receiver are not generally optimized for current channel conditions, and thus fail to&lt;br/&gt;exploit the full potential of the wireless channel. The shorter&lt;br/&gt;wavelengths proposed for future mobile radio will only serve to aggravate these problems. This research focuses on joint utilization of adaptive modulation and coding techniques, transmitter diversity methods and fading prediction algorithms suitable for rapidly varying multipath fading channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, a new approach to communication over fast-fading channels is exploited. The unifying idea is to predict future fading conditions at the receiver, and to feed these predictions to the transmitter for the optimization of the transmitted signal. This research is an interdisciplinary effort in communication theory, physics, and signal processing that encompasses novel physical models for multipath fading,&lt;br/&gt;channel prediction and tracking methods, and adaptive modulation, coding and power-control algorithms. The ultimate goal of this work is to more fully exploit the potential capacity of wireless communication channels, and in the process reduce the associated power and bandwidth requirements.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Real-Time Walkthroughs of Serious Synthetic Environments</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The goal - so far not entirely realized - of synthetic environments is to&lt;br/&gt;provide a realistic experience for their users. In particular, these&lt;br/&gt;environments can be used for active collaboration on engineering designs&lt;br/&gt;and medical applications. This project attacks some of the most important&lt;br/&gt;outstanding problems in the field of real-time synthetic environments:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Develop a scalable system to achieve real-time walkthrough of very large&lt;br/&gt;CAD models with high-accuracy rendering of spatial arrangements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Develop parallel rendering algorithms that take into account emerging&lt;br/&gt;graphics architectures with multiple graphics pipelines and general-purpose&lt;br/&gt;processors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop incremental algorithms to allow interactive updates to large&lt;br/&gt;dynamic environments, allowing objects to be moved, added, and removed in&lt;br/&gt;realistic manners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the algorithms that the project will explore are visibility culling,&lt;br/&gt;multi-resolution methods, model simplification, image-based rendering,3-D&lt;br/&gt;image warping, multi-pass rendering, and efficient updates for model&lt;br/&gt;hierarchies, occlusion databases, and level-of-detail generation. These&lt;br/&gt;advances will be tested on real-world models, including a 13&lt;br/&gt;million-element polygonal model of an electric generating station.</data>

The students work on projects in the area of dynamic distributed real-time systems including aspects of Quality of Service specification and management and benchmarking of such systems. Although the students are recruited nationwide, the program focuses on students from minority and women&apos;s institutions and from institutions lacking research facilities in the southwest region of the country. The student projects are related to a large, multi-year DARPA-funded research project. However, in addition to their participation in these projects, the students will be involved in literature searching, technical writing and making technical presentations.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9970909 Robert A. Paige&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this research are to improve software productivity, reliability, and performance of complex software systems. The approach uses program transformations to turn very high level&lt;br/&gt;perspicuous problem specifications into efficient implementations. The transformations to be used include dominated convergence (for implementing fixed points efficiently), finite differencing (for replacing costly repeated calculations by less expensive incremental counterparts), data structure selection (for simulating associative access on a RAM in real time), and partial evaluation (for eliminating interpretive overhead and simplification). These transformations are to be implemented in a transformational system, which itself is to be transformed from an executable specification into efficient C code. Experiments to be conducted are expected to demonstrate how earlier results showing a five-fold increase in the productivity of efficient algorithm implementation in C in comparison to hand-coded C for small-scale examples can be extended to large-scale examples of C programs that might exceed 100,000 lines. If successful, the results are expected to have important scientific and economic impact on the development of algorithmic software with particular application to program analysis and transformation.</data>

The resulting portable toolkit will be able to characterize I/O access patterns on PC workstation clusters, scalable parallel systems, and computational grids. The toolkit is based on Pablo, a portable performance environment that supports performance data capture and analysis. The National facility will provide system tools and experimental data needed for research in I/O system design, analysis, and optimization for scalable parallel and distributed systems. Web-based tutorials, demonstrations and exercises will be developed which, together with other outreach activities, will make these tools available and useful to smaller institutions.</data>

This investigation connects expander graphs to codes, sequences &lt;br/&gt;and exponential sums, three fundamental areas of communication science that are already deeply connected, and that already have many important applications in: the correction of errors in transmission and storage of data (e.g. to CD&apos;s), fault-tolerant systems, secure data communication, and cryptography. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators have recently introduced notions of projective coset graphs of codes and have constructed Ramanujan graphs and other good expander graphs from codes, sequences and related exponential sums that appear as eigenvalues of these graphs. Research thus far has shown that good codes and &lt;br/&gt;sequences lead to good expander graphs in general, and Ramanujan graphs in particular. Also, some exponential sums that appear in the construction of Ramanujan graphs and good expander graphs lead to very good codes and sequences. The investigation involves: i) a vast extension and generalization of the work done so far; ii) construction of Ramanujan graphs and other good expander graphs from algebraic geometric codes, codes over Galois rings, and other classes of codes; iii) practical and &lt;br/&gt;feasible applications of these graphs to the research areas mentioned above; and iv) discovery of new areas of applications. In addition, the investigators analyze the highly practical research work of the last fifty years in coding theory, sequence design and related exponential sums for efficient implementation of the proposed schemes.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">CCR-9877139&lt;br/&gt;Berman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project conducts research on the design, implementation, and analysis of algorithms for the support of scalable and reliable communication services in distributed networks. The focus centers around important challenges that affect the national network-communication infrastructure and the needs of increasing numbers of network users and services. These challenges included mitigating the stress on network backbone caused by the diminishing locality of network traffic, easing the addition of large numbers of geographically distributed network hosts, implementing fault-tolerant and congestion-tolerant communication methods, and integrating diverse technologies such as fast-switching and mobile communication devices into the national networking infrastructure. A significant obstacle in meeting these challenges is the difficulty of routing, switching, addressing, and guaranteeing delivery of messages in such a large and growing global network. This is a program of fundamental and applied research attacking these scalability and reliability problems using techniques of network algorithms, computational combinatorics and graph theory. The analysis of the topological structure of networks and the algorithmic properties associated with network routing schemes will be the primary focus. Extensive implementations and empirical studies building on the experience using the network platform provided by the Ohio Supercomputer Center and the OCARNet dedicated ATM research network will be performed.</data>

      <data key="e_title">KDI: A Distributed Cognition Approach To Designing Digital Work Materials For Collaborative Workplaces</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This is a three-year continuing award. To ensure that new workplaces and digital work materials serve human needs requires both a different theoretical base and an integration of theory with ethnographic and experimental methods. We propose a research framework based on distributed cognition. Distributed cognition provides a reorientation of how we think about designing and supporting human computer interaction. It permits one to move boundary of the cognitive unit of analysis out beyond the skin of the indivdual to include the material and social environment as components of a larger cognitive system. This focuses attention on the processes by which people take advantage of both internal and external resources to organize their actions. For the design of workplaces, this means that work materials are more than stimuli for disembodied cognitive sytems. Work materials become elements of the cognitive system itself, and cognition becomes an emergent property of the interactions among people and work materials. We will apply our integrated approach to developing a distributed cognition based theory of annotation and explore a range of application domains: collaborative scientific research, education, and commercial aviation. In each domain, we will conduct ethnographic and experimental studies, design and implement digital work materials and analyze their effectiveness. In addition, to help us develop and communicate our distributed cognition perspective, we are developing: (1) a series of prototypes of history-enriched work materials that support collection and selective sharing of personnel and group activity histories and annotations, (2) annotation facilities to assist collaborations, and (3) information visualization facilities to exploit rich histories of interactions and provide effective access to annotations.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Conformation-Driven Molecular Computing</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">CONRAD, Michael&lt;br/&gt;CCR-9610054&lt;br/&gt;Wayne State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high recognition capacity of proteins and other biological macromolecules derives largely from shape-based interactions. The pictures of a lock-key or jigsaw-like fit is frequently used to describe this type of molecular level pattern recognition. The goal of this research project is to harness this powerful intrinsic form of pattern recognition to solve computational problems. The basic idea is captured in the self-assembly model of computing. Signal patterns impinging on a device are transduced to molecular conformations which then self-organize to form a higher level complex (or mosaic). Shape features common to different mosaics represent different families of input patterns. Enzymes that recognize these shape features control the output of the device. The solution of potentially difficult symbolic pattern recognition problems is converted in this way to a macromolecular self-organization process driven by free energy minimization. Devices of this type cannot be programmed in a conventional sense, because of the difficulty of predicting the structural and functional consequences of conformational interactions. However, they are well suited to molding through directed evolution (due to the high structure-function plasticity of biological macromolecules) and to adaptation through error feedback acting on the internal structure of the device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical implementation of this scheme can operate on the basis of the conformational responses of single proteins to different patterns of milieu features. Shape-based enzyme recognition serves to transform input signal patterns (coded in chemical form) to output activity (detected spectroscopically). The particular protein being used for this purpose is mitochrondrial malate dehydrogenase, a readily available enzyme of carbohydrate metabolism, that could in the future easily be coupled to other enzymes to build up a repertoire of special purpose pattern processors that can be utilized as co-processors for a conventional machine linked into computational networks capable of performing complex recognition-action tasks.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9900326 John McCarthy and Carolyn Talcott&lt;br/&gt;Large software systems are increasingly complex and costly. The design, development, and maintenance of a system can be greatly helped by good documentation of its architecture, that is, of how it is structured into meaningful subsystems or components, and how those subsystems are glued together to form the overall system. A key unresolved problem is the interoperability problem, namely, how the architectural pieces and their multiple and possibly heterogeneous semantic descriptions corresponding to the different views fit together to make a coherent whole, and how these different descriptions impose constraints on each other. The main objectives of this collaborative project are (1) developing mathematical foundations for integrating and interoperating in a coherent and mathematically rigorous way diverse architectural descriptions, formal specifications, and executable prototypes of object-based distributed systems and (2) based on such foundations, developing a methodology for system design, development, and evolution that supports a seamless integration of the different formal and informal system descriptions and makes explicit the constraints that these different views of a system impose on each other. The development of mathematical foundations will be driven by substantial case studies and will begin with an in-depth study of a wide range of notations and formalisms and of their mutual relationships that seem particularly promising for describing systems at different levels. Rewriting logic will play an important role, not only as an executable specification formalism, but also as a reflective metalogical framework in which the chosen formalisms and their relations can be formalized. These formalizations can be executed using the meta tools developed in the Maude&lt;br/&gt;language, an implementation of rewriting logic. It is expected that these foundations and experimental methodology will advance the state of the art in software development and evolution, and will lead to new tools and methods that, when used properly, will substantially reduce the cost and effort of software development and maintenance.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">While the commodity desktop environment is growing in popularity, researchers continue to study architecture-based research questions using standard benchmark programs. Benchmarks possess behavior that is fundamentally different from the behavior of desktop applications. For instance, the reliance of desktop applications on the hosting operating system and dynamically linked libraries warrants careful consideration when pursuing performance-driven architectural tradeoffs targeting a desktop environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the future these applications will be developed in object-oriented languages. Again, this introduces a different program model that has not been rigorously addressed in the architectural research community. Object-oriented programs place significant pressure on instruction caches and branch prediction mechanisms. The focus of this research is to provide compile-time optimizations that take advantage of the profile information currently available in the desktop application environment. The goal is to develop new profile-based compiler optimization algorithms that can significantly accelerate the performance of desktop applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project pursues the following research areas: Parameter Value Prediction, Indirect Branch Prediction, Instruction Memory Coloring, Weighted Completion Time Instruction Scheduling. Graph-based program analysis using program profiles is used to guide these optimizations. Improved optimization techniques are employed to produce tuned executable images. These optimizations are implemented in existing compilation environments to quantify their performance gains.</data>

The oral traditions preserved in the language also known as ``Ladino&apos;&apos; but called ``Judeo-Spanish&apos;&apos; in this grant proposal, were gathered by Professors Farmstead, Katz, and Silverman during the years 1957-1980 from&lt;br/&gt;informants from Bosnia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Morocco, Israel, Spain, and the United States. This material is the largest collection of Judeo-Spanish oral literature in North America, and one of the three largest in the world. The Judeo-Spanish oral tradition preserves a cultural legacy for the study of Sephardic Jewry as well as for&lt;br/&gt;researchers in the history of pan-Hispanic and pan-European balladry. This oral tradition, with roots extending back into Middle Ages, provides a unique matrix within which Hispanic written literature was created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical goals of the project are to continue conversion of this material to a multi-media digital corpus so that these materials can be made ,more widely available, with increased access analytic capabilities. Textual transcriptions will be tagged using a number of markup methods, especially XML and a digital audio database will be created. A variety of approaches will be tested to make the archive fully extensible. The&lt;br/&gt;project will build on earlier research products from other digital libraries projects,&lt;br/&gt;including the University California, Berkeley digital libraries group.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">CCR-9821009&lt;br/&gt;Larmore&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research concerns on-line algorithms and is focused on two problems, generalizing well-known open problems. The first is: the given any on-line algorithm and any specific kind of restriction on computational power memory or information flow, does there exist, an on-line algorithm that satisfies this restriction and is still optimal (among all on-line algorithms)? The second is the question whether randomization helps for the 2-server problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the project introduces a new restriction on information flow for on-line algorithms called tracklessness and seeks to answer the above questions for trackless on-line algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some effort will also be expended on the major problem of the area, the k-server conjecture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the server problem, the research will attempt to settle a number of other on-line problems for which optimal competitiveness is unknown, including: randomized list update, multiprocessor scheduling, and page migration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of tools developed by the PI (in conjunction with Chrobak) have been used successfully, by them and by others, including workfunctions, pseudocost, competitive games, and convex hulls. Computer simulations are an essential tool in the research. A major component of the work in finding additional generic tools for classes of problems.</data>

The competition is being managed by the CSIDC Committee of the IEEE Computer Society. The competing teams are tasked with design and implementation of a selected prototype system that addresses a common problem. Teams are made up of three-to-five full-time undergraduate students who attend the same college or university. Each team receives a project kit, which consists of a number of hardware and software components, given by co-sponsoring technology companies. Teams work under the supervision of a faculty advisor over a three to four month period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projects are judged according to the team&apos;s ability to achieve the design objective; the creativity of the project; the project&apos;s usability, marketability, and maintainability; the choice of trade-offs made; and other factors. The detailed judging criteria are published in advance of the competition and each project is judged by one of several three-person evaluation teams. Each evaluation team evaluates five submissions and identifies the top two to a nine-person judging panel. The panel selects the top ten teams who advance to the Finals. The top five winners and five honorable mentions receive monetary awards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial funding to assist with the costs of administering and running the competition for its first two years. It is planned that the project will become self-sufficient in future years.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The focus of this research is the development and implementation of &lt;br/&gt;efficient algorithms for several problems involving optimal placement of &lt;br/&gt;polygonal annulus regions with respect to a set of points. The optimality &lt;br/&gt;criteria may be either maximizing the numbers of points contained by a &lt;br/&gt;fixed sized annulus, or minimizing the size of the annulus necessary to &lt;br/&gt;contain a fixed number of points. The annulus placement problems are &lt;br/&gt;motivated by applications in geometric tolerancing, mobile robot &lt;br/&gt;localization using range finding, and pattern matching problems arising in &lt;br/&gt;computer vision. We are interested in both scaled and offset annulus &lt;br/&gt;regions, translation and rotation, convex and simple polygons, and &lt;br/&gt;off-line and on-line variants of the problem.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Proposal Title - Feedback Control Real-Time Scheduling&lt;br/&gt;PIs - J. Stankovic, S. Son and G. Tao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the significant body of results in real-time scheduling, many&lt;br/&gt;real world problems are not easily supported. While algorithms such as&lt;br/&gt;Earliest Deadline First, Rate Monotonic, and the Spring scheduling&lt;br/&gt;algorithm can support sophisticated task set characteristics (such as&lt;br/&gt;deadlines, precedence constraints, shared resources, jitter, etc.), they&lt;br/&gt;are all &quot;open loop&quot; scheduling algorithms. Open loop refers to the &lt;br/&gt;fact that once schedules are created they are not &quot;adjusted&quot; based &lt;br/&gt;on continuous feedback. While open-loop scheduling algorithms can &lt;br/&gt;perform well in static or dynamic systems in which the workloads can &lt;br/&gt;be accuratedly modeled, they can perform poorly in unpredictable dynamic &lt;br/&gt;systems, i.e., systems whose workloads cannot be accurately modeled. &lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, many real-world complex systems are dynamic and &lt;br/&gt;unpredictable. In addition, most scheduling paradigms assume that&lt;br/&gt;timing requirements are known and fixed, while in real systems timing &lt;br/&gt;requirements are more flexible. For example, instead of a single &lt;br/&gt;fixed deadline for a task, a deadline range might be acceptable to &lt;br/&gt;the physical system. If this range was passed to the scheduling system, &lt;br/&gt;more robust scheduling could be possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to develop the&lt;br/&gt;beginnings of a new scheduling paradigm, which we call feedback&lt;br/&gt;control real-time scheduling. Feedback control real-time scheduling will&lt;br/&gt;define error terms for schedules, monitor the error, and continuously adjust&lt;br/&gt;the schedules to maintain stable performance. Feedback control real-time&lt;br/&gt;scheduling will be able to deal with dynamic systems that are both resource&lt;br/&gt;insufficient and with unpredictable workload. It can also be integrated &lt;br/&gt;with flexible real-time requirements. We plan to base this new paradigm &lt;br/&gt;on the theory and practice of control theory, adaptive control theory, &lt;br/&gt;and stochastic control. In this proposed research we will begin by &lt;br/&gt;integrating practical feedback control techniques into scheduling &lt;br/&gt;algorithms. These scheduling algorithms regard the computer system &lt;br/&gt;as a control system with the scheduler as the controller. The&lt;br/&gt;outcome from this beginning study&lt;br/&gt;should include a practical scheduling algorithm, plus some&lt;br/&gt;experimental evidence to use in the long-term endeavor of creating &lt;br/&gt;a theory and practice of feedback control scheduling. Such results will &lt;br/&gt;apply to many real world systems including real-time database applications, &lt;br/&gt;defense applications, agile manufacturing, and distributed multimedia. &lt;br/&gt;The results would be that these systems meet significantly more deadlines &lt;br/&gt;thereby improving the productivity of a manufacturing plant or an on-line &lt;br/&gt;real-time database system.

      <data key="e_title">A Role for Declarative and Procedural Memory in Language</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Human language depends upon a dictionary of words (the mental lexicon) and rules which specify how those words are put together into larger words, phrases, and sentences (the mental grammar). The computational and brain bases of these two fundamental language capacities are still not well understood. This project investigates the novel view that the learning and use of the two language capacities depends upon two more general-purpose memory systems whose neural foundations are relatively well studied. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the acquisition and use of words depends upon &quot;declarative memory&quot; temporal-lobe brain circuits previously shown to underlie the learning and use of fact knowledge, such as what a zebra is and where it lives. It is also hypothesized that the acquisition and use of grammatical rules depends upon &quot;procedural memory&quot; left frontal/basal-ganglia brain circuits previously shown to underlie the learning and expression of motor and cognitive &quot;skills,&quot; such as riding a bicycle. On this &quot;declarative/procedural&quot; view of language, lexicon and grammar are linked to distinct general-purpose systems, each responsible for a particular set of language and non-language functions. The declarative/procedural view contrasts with the two main classes of previously proposed theories regarding the computational and neural mechanisms of language. It shares the perspective of traditional &quot;dual-system&quot; theories that lexicon and grammar depend upon distinct systems, but it diverges from their claim that these systems are responsible for language alone. Conversely, while the declarative/procedural view agrees with &quot;single-system&quot; theories that the two language capacities depend upon general-purpose brain circuitry, it diverges from their claim that both capacities are linked to a single system with a broad distribution in the brain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To distinguish the three views, the project will focus on a simple distinction in language: between regular and irregular transformations in past tense and in other aspects of language. In this distinction lexicon and grammar can be contrasted, while other psychologically relevant factors are held constant. Irregular transformations are at least partially arbitrary (e.g., sing-sang, bring-brought), and therefore must depend upon memory, whereas regular transformations are predictable (e.g., verb + -ed), and so could be computed by a grammatical rule. Thus links are predicted among irregulars (lexicon), facts, and temporal-lobe circuits, and among regulars (grammar), skills, and frontal/basal-ganglia circuits. Patients with brain damage limited to particular temporal-lobe areas (e.g., &quot;posterior aphasics&quot;) should have more trouble with irregulars than regulars, and with facts than skills. Patients with damage limited to particular left frontal/basal-ganglia structures (e.g., &quot;anterior aphasics&quot;) should show the opposite pattern. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If indeed the declarative and procedural memory systems play a role in lexicon and grammar, then data from numerous investigations of the neural, computational, and developmental underpinnings of the two brain memory systems in humans and in animals will contribute to our understanding of language. Conversely, new approaches to the study of the two memory systems will become possible on the basis of our knowledge of language structure, processing, and acquisition. Tests of lexicon and grammar, such as those used in the proposed project, may become useful probes of the two brain systems. In addition to the advancement of fundamental knowledge in cognitive science, the contributions of animal and human studies of the two brain systems to our understanding of language should lead to new clinical approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of acquired and developmental language disorders.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project is to design robust and efficient computational kernel software for solving large sparse unstructured linear systems on high performance computers. Such large scale problems can only be solved by iteritive techniques. The iterative techniques under our consideration include multilevel preconditioning techniques and algebraic multigrid methods. Our goal is to unify these two groups of methods and to take advantage of both and avoid the disadvantages of either.&lt;br/&gt;We will investigate, design, and test algebraic preconditioners that offer the scalability of multigrid techniques, the parallelism of domain decomposition methods, and the robustness of incomplete LIU preconditioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will also use a factored sparse approximate inverse technique to replace standard iterative schemes in algebraic multigrid methods. Such an approach may increase the robustness of our methods and improve their parallelism. Graph partitioning of submatrices is to be used to balance loads among processors. The proposed research will result in a software package that may be used by researchers and engineers as kernel software in large scale numerical simulations and&lt;br/&gt;computations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general purpose high performance iterative solvers from this research project are expected to make significant impact in the field of applied scientific computing. The results of the research will make a clear judgment concerning the relative advantages and disadvantages of algebraic multigrid methods and multilevel incomplete LU preconditioning methods. The research has applications in aerospace, semiconductor, reservoir simulation, combustion, ocean/climate modeling, and pollution tracking</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project involves development of a new reconfigurable computing architecture, called MorphoSys, through close collaboration among researchers and students at University of California, Irvine (UCI) and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). This unique architecture combines a reconfigurable Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) coprocessor with a RISC core microprocessor on the same chip. Moreover, in order to address the special needs of image/signal processing applications, the MorphoSys architecture includes a unique image data buffer for efficient data streaming. Behavioral level simulation of the M1 chip has shown the architecture to be quite promising for a variety of applications (MPEG-2 and ATR), achieving performance much more superior to the standard general purpose microprocessors and close to specialized ASIC-based solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UCI and UFRJ researchers have been working closely for the development of the behavioral model of M1 chip. The UFRJ research group has designed the RISC core that is used for controlling the SIMD coprocessor in M1. This block is considered one of the most complex components of the chip requiring custom-made as well as synthesizable circuits. It is proposed that UFRJ group handle the physical design of the RISC core, while the UCI group completes the remaining blocks of the M1 chip that is estimated to have more than 1.5 million transistors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with physical design, the other objectives for collaboration between the two groups at UCI and UFRJ include development of programming and testing environment for M1, mapping and performance evaluation for a wide range of applications, and design of second version of the MorphoSys architecture. We visualize that this collaboration will enhance the educational experience of students both at UCI and at UFRJ in Brazil, by providing them an opportunity to work in a competitive, target-oriented, multi-cultural environment using the latest technology.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">A growing number of applications for 3D graphics and imaging systems require the customized approach to the design of high performance 3D graphics and imaging systems. The progress in hardware support of graphics API functionality gives a real possibility to use a top-down approach in the design of custom systems based on the mixed hardware/software implementation of OpenGL API architecture. Software simulation is relatively cheap and fast way for initial architecture template development and evaluation to acquire the structure and key parameters that can be used later for elaboration in hardware description language level.&lt;br/&gt; The project includes the implementation of 3D graphics system architecture model based on OpenGL hardware support simulation. The object-oriented approach has been used for this development of analytic and software behavioral models simulating hardware units in different stages of graphics pipeline. Interactive Imaging System Architecture Composer has been developed for fast run-time architecture reconfiguration, simulation management, data acquisition and visual interpretation. The expandable set of architecture templates uses a reconfigurable shared library of &quot;virtual hardware units&quot; simulating various hardware structures for graphics and image processing.&lt;br/&gt; The project realization provides a set of simulation and performance evaluation tools for computer architects to cover the first steps in top-down design process. The graphics/imaging system design can be customized and this technology might be expanded from corporate level to public domain to make it available for engineers willing to build graphics/imaging systems for particular applications.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">EIA-9819892&lt;br/&gt;Karimi, Hassan&lt;br/&gt;Novak, Joan H.&lt;br/&gt;MCNC-North Carolina Supercomputing Center&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a planning grant to explore possibilities for geospatial data mining, conflation, searching, and extraction techniques for integrated air, water and land environmental modeling activities in a distributed environment. The long-term goal is to be able to model the transportation and ultimate effect of nutrients and chemicals. EPA would be the primary partner agency (with some involvement of the US Geological Survey), and the Neuse River basin watershed in North Carolina would be the context.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Signal/Noise Modeling and Detector Design for Media Noise Dominated Magnetic Recording Systems</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The object of the project is the development of the necessary tools and know-how to design and implementable signal detector for magnetic recording systems operating in signal-dependent correlated noise environments, i.e., media noise dominated environments. According to recent studies, it is anticipated that the current magnetic recording technology will hit the superparamagnetic limit in approximately five years. The superparamagnetic limit occurs when the magnetic media particles become so small that thermal energy at room temperature is enough to destabilize the particle by randomly switching its magnetization orientation. To push back the approaching superparamagnetic limit, signal processing circuits will have to cope with a radically changed signal/noise environment: the signal-to-noise ratio will drop, the magnetic media noise will dominate over the electronics white noise, and the overall noise will become extremely correlated and signal-dependent due to the intersymbol interactions in the magnetic media and due to the coloring introduced by the read head. This project will develop a fundamental understanding of nonstationary stochastic modeling and use it to develop a magnetic recording detector ideally tuned to correlated nonstationary media noise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be conducted through collaboration between Harvard University and IBM Almaden Research Center. IBM, a recognized global magnetic recording technology leader, is in a unique position to provide the cutting edge experimental support required establishing the link between the theoretical and experimental parts of the project. The project combines three major efforts. (i) A understanding of signal-dependent noise modeling issues will be developed. This is an extension of widely used autoregressive modeling methods in stationary processes to nonstationary processes. Particular attention will be given to objective model-size estimation through the adaptation of Akaike&apos;s information theoretic criterion or Rissanen&apos;s minimum description length principle. (ii) The receiver will be designed through a complexity-constrained optimization procedure. Since both the intersymbol interference length and the noise memory length contribute equally to the receiver complexity, the constrained-complexity detector will minimize the sum of the two lengths under a performance specification. (iii) The final goal is the implementation of the detector in VLSI technology. Towards this goal, a software detector and then a hardware detector will be developed. Both detectors will be tested in real channel environments at IBM Almaden Research Center.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Collaborative Information Retrieval</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Information retrieval has been viewed as an individual activity. This project investigates information retrieval in collaborative situations. It defines collaborative information retrieval (CIR) as any activity that collectively resolves an information problem taken by members of a work team, and investigates the manifestations of CIR in work settings. Guided by a work-centered conceptual framework for the evaluation and design of information systems, the study follows three steps: (1) creating a model of CIR through field observations and analyses of information seeking behavior of four work teams; (2) validating and generalizing the model through a survey; and (3) examining technological developments and organizational changes that might enhance CIR. As the first study of its kind, the project explains how information is acquired, shared and used in work situations. As a result, (1) issues in knowledge management in organizations are addressed and (2) the development of technologies that support, facilitate, and enhance teamwork is guided. On the theoretical side, the project extends an existing conceptual framework to include teamwork and thus, (1) creates a new analytical tool that informs other studies about CIR, and (2) enriches other conceptual constructs both in information retrieval and in collaborative work.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">EIA-9974968&lt;br/&gt;Grimshaw, Andrew S.&lt;br/&gt;University of Virginia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next Generation Software: Supporting Complex Application Requirements in Metasystems &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work addresses two critical problems facing metasystems applications designers: a lack of a sufficient set of tools by which to structure their applications, predict performance, and make scheduling decisions; and a lack of application-level fault-tolerance techniques. This proposal will address these problems by building upon our past experiences with Legion, which is an architecture for designing and building system services that provides to users the illusion of a single virtual machine with secure shared objects and shared name spaces. The single virtual machine may consist of hundreds of distributed and heterogeneous resources in multiple administration domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IDAEMA (Integrated Design, Analysis, and Execution of Metasystems Applications) is a multi-stage advice and performance prediction tool for metasystems. During application design, IDAEMA uses a library of cataloged research results based on application characteristics and high-level application requirements to provide analysis and advice regarding how to structure the program. This advice provides multiple views that describe the implications of design choices on application requirements, software engineering costs, and predicted performance-from advice in how to get started programming in a metasystems environment to code templates and existing components upon which to base the functionality of the application. At run-time, IDAEMA uses static and dynamic information about the hardware and software of the target metasystem in combination with the application user&apos;s security, fault-tolerance, predictability and cost requirements to provide assistance and performance prediction at multiple levels of abstraction and resolution. Our approach to fault-tolerance is based upon our use of the RFE model (Reflective Graph and Event) and the conviction that no single fault-tolerance mechanism is appropriate for all applications. Instead application must be free to use a variety of different techniques, all in the same system. RGE provides a flexible, configurable mechanism for attaching arbitrary computation in the form of program graphs to events. Exoevents, Exoevent Interests, and Exoevent Interest Sets are used to dynamically configure application-specific fault-tolerance techniques. Together, these two components provide new flexibility and predictability for metasystems application development and execution. IDAEMA and the RGE model are validated through proposed modifications to Legion in combination with collaborators at NPACI site developing applications that include a coupled ocean-climate model and a full-scale simulation of an integrated system for intelligent processing of materials.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Investigating Multi-Modality Tutoring: Toward Computer-Based Written English Support for Deaf Children</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project continues and expands upon the PIs&apos; prior work on a writing tutor designed to aid deaf students in acquiring written English, in which natural language processing techniques are combined with an understanding of how the structure of sign language (both its visual elements and its semantics) may affect written English to help identify English writing errors and to improve corrective feedback. In the current proposal, the PIs plan to investigate the integration of an animated signing agent into the tutoring system framework laid out in their earlier research. To this end, they will examine and develop tutoring strategies that incorporate the use of a visual signed modality. Although they are not proposing to develop the animated sign agent itself (that being the work of others), they are interested in determining how the addition of such an agent might affect the tutoring capabilities of the system. Important issues involve capturing the structure of tutoring dialogues, as well as making principled choices between the textual and signed modalities within a dialogue. Strategies for delivering a mixed-modal tutorial dialogue will also be considered, e.g. for situations where some of the tutoring will be signed but may need to refer to either static text on the screen or to textually delivered tutorial material. In addition, the PIs propose an ongoing series of exploratory and evaluation studies to determine which modalities should be incorporated and how they should be presented. Through this process, the PIs expect to discover which individual aspects of the project need improvement before they are integrated into the overall system. The immediate impact will be in the area of natural language generation and, in particular, multi-modal generation. Understanding of how to integrate information from various modalities in a tutoring context will be enhanced. In the long term, it is hoped that development of the PIs&apos; writing tutor will positively impact the literacy skills of people who are deaf.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9901017 Betty Cheng&lt;br/&gt;This project bridges the gap between formal and informal approaches to embedded systems development by formalizing part of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), an object-oriented modeling notation that is quickly becoming the de facto standard. Three of the UML notations, use cases, class diagrams, and state diagrams will be investigated; these three models sufficiently represent embedded-systems requirements. Through formalization, the models can be integrated into a single specification that can be analyzed for consistency, concurrency properties (e.g., deadlock, liveness), and constraint satisfaction. In choosing the representations, an assessment will be made as to how they can be analyzed using simulation, model checking, and a combination of these approaches. The specifications will also be assessed to determine how well they can be used to construct automated design transformations that refine the diagrams into design-level specifications. The investigations will yield a framework for systematically and rigorously developing&lt;br/&gt;embedded systems, where informal requirements are formalized and refined with design information to obtain the corresponding implementation. A prototype will be developed to support the graphical construction of the models, generate the corresponding specifications, and provide access to the analysis tools. The formalizations will be applied to increasingly complex case studies to ensure that the approach is applicable to real projects from industry.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Integrated Circuits for Broadband Line-of-Sight RF Communication Systems</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Abstract&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The backbone infrastructure for the emerging broadband integrated services digital network (B-ISDN) will primarily employ optical fiber technologies due to the extremely high capacities of these channels. An attractive alternative, and in some cases companion, to optical fiber for giga-bit per second communications is radio frequency (RF) for line-of-sight wireless communication. Such channels, including both terrestrial and satellite, have many potential advantages over optical fiber counterparts. They can be deployed over a wide range of geographical areas; are flexible and can easily be expanded; allow rapid deployment in remote environments including military, disaster relief, and emergency medical applications; and finally, can act as a back-up for optical fiber-based networks. While &quot;high-integration&quot; implies single-chip solutions in applications where silicon technologies can meet system speed requirements, &quot;high-integration&quot; in electronics for giga-bit communication systems means the minimization of total chip and component count; i.e., a result minimizing overall board space. Typically, more than one integrated circuit (IC) technology will be involved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves the investigation of signal processing partitioning and the development of integrated circuits utilizing various IC technologies including InP, GaAs, and silicon to implement highly-integrated portable modems for giga-bit per second throughput over wireless RF terrestrial and satellite channels. A focus of this research is the development of circuit approaches to implement the IF-to-baseband processing in the analog domain. An analog solution can potentially result in a much lower power consumption than a digital implementation. BPSK and QPSK receiver structures will be examined and methods &lt;br/&gt;to maximize integration and minimize power consumption will be studied. An end goal of this research is to develop a working prototype link including RF, IF, baseband, and error control functions with a throughput on the order of a giga-bit per second and a bit-error rate (BER) on the order of 10E-12.</data>

It is a syntactically simple and natural extension, but semantically powerful extension of the conventional object structuring approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the proposed research, the PI&apos;s intend to render the TMO-based RT distributed computing application software engineering methodology in a more versatile form and validate the effectiveness of the methodology in real application environments, via a systematic university-industry collaborative experimental study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the milestones in the project include establishing: &lt;br/&gt;Formalized TMO-structured modeling techniques for hierarchical multi-level specification, design and analysis of complex distributed systems&lt;br/&gt;C++ and Java based tools for TMO-structured RT and distributed programming and expression of high level abstractions&lt;br/&gt;Middleware models of commercial level RT OS systems&lt;br/&gt;Techniques and tools for analysis and timeliness-guarantees of TMO component based software systems&lt;br/&gt;Techniques for dynamic optimization of mobile software components&lt;br/&gt;Techniques and tools for visualization of real-time simulations&lt;br/&gt;Demonstration and validation of all the techniques and tools developed in the project.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The research objective is to identify strategies and learning techniques for automated agents that will be able to participate successfully in auctions and negotiations. Auctions and negotiations can be used to resolve conflicts in a wide variety of multi-agent domains. Our main application domain will be electronic commerce. We will also continue to develop our simulation of document allocation in distributed information servers. These agents have insufficient information upon which to base strategic decisions. Thus, we propose&lt;br/&gt;to identify learning methods for agents participating in auctions. We will use well known learning techniques and will focus on the questions: how accurate are the agent&apos;s expectations based on the learned information? and how does the learning process influence the negotiation and the auction outcome? Finally, human-computer experiments will be conducted focusing on the extent to which the information collected and evaluated by automated agents will be accessed and utilized by human participants in auctions. The significance of this research lies in its contribution to the development of autonomous agents capable of reaching mutually beneficial agreements efficiently in complex environments characterized by uncertainty and incomplete information. Our results will be particularly applicable to the emerging areas of electronic commerce and digital libraries.</data>

This can be accomplished by developing techniques like data staging, by moving data in advance and storing them close to the receiver, and the proposed project will investigate such notions of the logistical network computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal will develop such approaches and techniques and use existing tools and protocols to implement and test these ideas, such as the Internet Backplane Protocol, the Network Weather Service, NetSolve, and the Application Level Scheduling systems that the PI and his co-PI&apos;s have developed over the years. The effort will result in middleware support more readily exploited by the applications.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project addresses the needs of the legally blind to interact with information systems that utilize graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The research focuses on the study of descriptive animated icons and the development of a framework to enable GUI developers to more effectively address the icon recognition process utilized by the legally blind when designing interface layout and functionality. In an initial study the PIs will determine optimal sizes for icons, animated as well as non-animated, that are perceived by individuals whose visual acuity is in the range of 20/200 to 20/800. This study will result in a heuristic that will allow them to describe the means by which legally blind computer users interact with a GUI. The PIs will then design a library of animated icons which will serve as a foundation in the development of GUIs that are accessible to the legally blind. A proof-of-concept application will be developed and evaluated using this technology, in order to provide information on how to properly integrate animated icons into a GUI to achieve the stated goals. The PIs expect the icon library developed as part of this project to be applicable to a wide variety of application domains, and that the use of properly sized, descriptive animated icons in GUIs will help the increasing legally blind population to access information in electronic form.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This research examines how household computing and the&lt;br/&gt;Internet are changing the social and psychological well being of the&lt;br/&gt;American family, and compares the influence of these new technologies&lt;br/&gt;on households with that of older ones--telephones and&lt;br/&gt;televisions. The research objectives are (1) to determine whether the&lt;br/&gt;early results showing that use of the Internet decreases psychological&lt;br/&gt;and social well being generalizes across samples, Internet services, and&lt;br/&gt;time, (2) to identify mechanism for these effects, and (3) to compare&lt;br/&gt;the impact of different patterns of household information technology&lt;br/&gt;use. Data will come from a national three-wave, panel survey, allowing one&lt;br/&gt;to examine how the amount of television, telephone, computing, and&lt;br/&gt;Internet people use at one time predict later changes in their social&lt;br/&gt;involvement and psychological well being at a subsequent time. The&lt;br/&gt;survey will be supplemented with a quasi-experiment, in which a subsample&lt;br/&gt;of respondents who have computers but no Internet access will be&lt;br/&gt;randomly assigned free Internet access instead of a cash payments to&lt;br/&gt;participate in the survey. Results will have implications both for&lt;br/&gt;emerging policy debate about universal access to the Internet and for&lt;br/&gt;the design of socially responsible Internet services.</data>

The award drives an ambitious program that focuses on FIU&apos;s strengths in the areas of human-computer interface research to include those persons with disabilities; key aspects of information processing (image and signal), including real-time applications; hardware-software integration; distributed processing, and data structures. A supplemental instruction component is included to tackle head-on the failure rates in those SEM &quot;high risk&quot; courses (failure rates exceeding 30%), which are critical foundations for Computer Science and Engineering. Within the proposed infrastructure, a comprehensive pipeline is established to attract more students in engineering and to redress at FIU the national trend showing limited graduation rates in Computer Science and Engineering. The project also addresses the recruitment and retention of students from groups traditionally underrepresented in Computer Science and Engineering, namely women, Hispanics and African Americans. In addition to these educational enhancements, the impact of the project will be extended through expected research results in distributed processing, and image and signal processing, particularly in their application to human-computer interfaces for individuals with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this effort, Florida International University is expected to develop further its computing science and engineering research capabilities involving minority students in greater numbers, paving the way for eventual conferring of more doctoral degrees, not only to Hispanic students, but also to African American, and disabled students. It is hoped that through these efforts, the nation might find a successful model that will help in building a better racially and ethnically balanced technological enterprise for the benefit of its present and future generations.</data>

Serel, a focal point for stimulating student research, will be enhanced with networks, computers, and server capabilities to further research in software engineering. The award will also be used to prepare the CIS Department for CSAB accreditation. Software Engineering methods, techniques, and tools will be developed further to:&lt;br/&gt;Predict execution times of code segments by examining object code generated&lt;br/&gt;Extend UML with Real-Time Architecture Specification (RAS) and Real-Time Computational Tree Logic (RTCTL)&lt;br/&gt;Adapt spoken language dialogues allowing linguistic knowledge to evolve the dialogues&lt;br/&gt;Build a system prototype to &quot;compute with words&quot; that provides users the freedom, to use their natural language protocols&lt;br/&gt;Develop testing techniques and tools&lt;br/&gt;Develop methods and algorithms for information retrieval from structured un-structured data sources using ontological knowledge domains &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While increasing the participation of women and minorities in graduate education, the project will facilitate, enhance, and intensify research in CISE areas. Through this effort, FAMU is expected to develop further its computer and information science and software engineering research capabilities involving minority students in greater numbers, paving the way for the conferring of more doctoral degrees to under-represented groups, particularly African Americans and women in Computer Information Science and Engineering.

      <data key="e_title">Evolution of Co-dimension k&gt;1 Manifolds Embedded in R^n and Applications to Medical Image Analysis</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Faugeras&lt;br/&gt;9972228&lt;br/&gt; The investigators and their colleagues study the problem of&lt;br/&gt;automatically clustering sets of points that lie on smooth&lt;br/&gt;manifolds of arbitrary co-dimension. They use the geodesic snake&lt;br/&gt;approach in which they set up a Partial Differential Equation&lt;br/&gt;(PDE) that drives the evolution of a manifold in some potential&lt;br/&gt;field created by the data points, such that the solution of the&lt;br/&gt;PDE converges to a manifold that is very close to the data points&lt;br/&gt;(ideally contains them). The &quot;shape&quot; of this manifold (including&lt;br/&gt;its co-dimension) characterizes the set of points. They&lt;br/&gt;investigate computationally efficient implementations for&lt;br/&gt;evolving manifolds of arbitrary co-dimension by level sets&lt;br/&gt;methods, because of their robustness and flexibility. These&lt;br/&gt;implementations are being used to study the Euclidean and affine&lt;br/&gt;mean-curvature motion of curves in three-dimensional spaces. Two&lt;br/&gt;applications are being pursued by the investigators. The first&lt;br/&gt;application is the detection of blood vessels in Magnetic&lt;br/&gt;Resonance Angiography (MRA) images. In MRA images, blood vessels&lt;br/&gt;appear as bright and noisy curve-like patterns, possibly with&lt;br/&gt;gaps. It is important to detect those patterns independently of&lt;br/&gt;the noise and to bridge the gaps. The detection of blood vessels&lt;br/&gt;can be considered, as a first approximation, as an instance of&lt;br/&gt;the three-dimensional case, co-dimension two. The second&lt;br/&gt;application is the clustering of feature points in higher&lt;br/&gt;dimensional spaces with an eye on two specific problems, the&lt;br/&gt;description of the &quot;shape&quot; of a cluster and the design of&lt;br/&gt;automated content-based image retrieval systems. A given pattern,&lt;br/&gt;e.g. an image, can be represented by a vector of features in some&lt;br/&gt;n-dimensional space. Patterns in the same class usually fall into&lt;br/&gt;clusters that may have some very tricky &quot;shapes&quot;. The&lt;br/&gt;investigators and their collegues believe that their methods can&lt;br/&gt;provide ways of automatically obtaining shape descriptions from&lt;br/&gt;sets of sample feature vectors thereby facilitating the design of&lt;br/&gt;recognition algorithms and improving their performances. A target&lt;br/&gt;application is the design of automated content-based image&lt;br/&gt;retrieval systems.&lt;br/&gt; The investigators and their colleagues study the problem of&lt;br/&gt;automatically fitting a set of points in a possibly&lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional space to a set of smooth manifolds. This is&lt;br/&gt;important because in many practical applications data can be&lt;br/&gt;represented as points in high-dimensional spaces. They are&lt;br/&gt;currently pursuing two applications of these techniques. The&lt;br/&gt;first one is the detection of blood vessels in Magnetic Resonance&lt;br/&gt;Angiography (MRA) images. In MRA images, blood vessels appear as&lt;br/&gt;bright and noisy curve-like patterns, possibly with gaps. It is&lt;br/&gt;important to detect those patterns independently of the noise and&lt;br/&gt;to bridge the gaps. The results of this detection can be used in&lt;br/&gt;the diagnosis of diseases and in planning surgery. The second&lt;br/&gt;application is the description of the &quot;shape&quot; of a cluster of&lt;br/&gt;points in a high-dimensional space. The investigators and their&lt;br/&gt;colleagues are investigating means of automatically obtaining&lt;br/&gt;such descriptions from a set of samples. They believe that this&lt;br/&gt;will facilitate the design of recognition algorithms and increase&lt;br/&gt;their performances. A target application that is particularly&lt;br/&gt;relevant to the average citizen is the design of automated&lt;br/&gt;content-based image retrieval systems. In such systems each image&lt;br/&gt;can be represented by a point in some high-dimensional (10 to 20)&lt;br/&gt;feature space, and images in the same class, e.g. images of cars,&lt;br/&gt;cluster on some manifold, e.g a &quot;car-manifold&quot;. The description&lt;br/&gt;of the shape of this manifold (which is simpler than the real&lt;br/&gt;shapes of the objects in the class) can then be used to retrieve&lt;br/&gt;all images of, e.g. cars, in the data base because their&lt;br/&gt;representations in the high-dimensional space will be closer to&lt;br/&gt;the corresponding manifold than to any other.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">CCR-9970893 Khoshgoftaar, Taghi M.&lt;br/&gt;Discovering Software Process Measures Using Genetic Programming is a research project that is developing automated methods for finding algorithms that measure novel and useful attributes of software development processes using genetic programming. A cost-effective strategy for assuring high quality software is to target enhancement activities to those modules that are most likely to have faults. When the methods being developed by this project are applied to a software development project, the resulting software process metrics will be novel, specialized for the development organization, and useful for predicting software quality. Genetic programming is a promising technology that is well-suited to searching for novel combinations of algorithmic elements that satisfy complex criteria. This project&apos;s contributions to the state of the art are empirical exploration of data stored by feature tracking systems and problem reporting systems to discover software process metrics that are useful as independent variables in software quality models, an automated method for goal-driven discovery and measurement of specialized software process metrics using genetic programming, and a demonstration of the application of genetic programming to a new domain, namely, software measurement. This improvement in the state of the art will enable software developers to achieve practical, cost-effective process improvement guided by predictions from software quality models at a new level of accuracy and robustness.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">While the Internet economy is growing rapidly, little is systematically known or understood regarding key business issues in this new domain. Emerging theories of electronic commerce and organizing electronic business are based on the physical economy. However, the literature on testing of related models and assumptions is sparse, primarily due to difficulties in collecting relevant field data. Field experimentation can provide valuable insights into electronic markets and can be a strong complement to the experimental economics discipline. The principal investigators have developed Experimental Digital Economy (EDE), an extensive technological environment for creating a long-term virtual electronic market. Real digital goods are produced and traded through EDE and consumed by agents based on real incentives. It enables the testing of propositions and hypotheses generated from economics based modeling of competition and consumer behavior in an electronic market, and can also lead to systematic discoveries. Prior experiments with EDE have led to insights regarding successful business strategies (e.g., mass customization, selling format, etc.) and processes (e.g., customer care, coordination) for digital products companies. The proposed research will explore the effectiveness of various market mechanisms (e.g., posted prices and auction systems, intermediary-based certification and reputation building, etc.) for information and software goods.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Virtual Topologies for Multiparty Communication</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This proposal seeks to improve multiparty communication on the Internet by applying models&lt;br/&gt;and methodology from the fields of graph theory and parallel and distributed computing. Multiparty&lt;br/&gt;communication refers to any type of information exchange among a group of participants, including&lt;br/&gt;conferences, advertising, electronic voting, remote monitoring, and meta-computing.&lt;br/&gt;Multicast, or one-to-many communication, has received the most attention from network proto-&lt;br/&gt;col designers and has been implemented on a subset of the Internet known as the MBone. Several&lt;br/&gt;obstacles to the universal deployment of multicast remain, such as high cost and lack of robustness.&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, some multiparty applications are not able to operate, or operate less efficiently, because&lt;br/&gt;multicast is a poor match for their style of communication. Large-scale electronic voting, for exam-&lt;br/&gt;ple, could use a many-to-one network service, with balloting results partially tabulated on the way&lt;br/&gt;to a central reporting service.&lt;br/&gt; Research from the fields of graph theory and parallel and distributed computing has solved many&lt;br/&gt;of these problems, albeit for environments that differ greatly from that of the Internet. The key to&lt;br/&gt;applying these results to Internet protocols is the use of a virtual topology that maps a theoretical&lt;br/&gt;substructure onto the physical network. As with the MBone, the links in the virtual topology could&lt;br/&gt;consist of some physical links and some virtual links implemented by encapsulation tunnels.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research first addresses limitations in current multicast routing protocols. The researchers&lt;br/&gt;propose to investigate the use of spanners as a virtual topology for densely-populated multicast&lt;br/&gt;groups, thus improving the efficiency of the periodic ooding used in this domain. For sparsely-&lt;br/&gt;populated groups, we propose to apply hypercube message passing algorithms used in parallel&lt;br/&gt;computation to the design of a more efficient and fault-tolerant multicast protocol. The researchers then plan&lt;br/&gt;to apply the techniques used for multicast virtual topologies to other multiparty communication&lt;br/&gt;paradigms. The researchers have identified promising research directions for reduction (many-to-one), subcast (one-to-some), and multi-source multicast (few-to-many).&lt;br/&gt; The project will progress in three main stages: analysis, protocol design and evaluation. The&lt;br/&gt;analysis stage is intended to identify virtual topologies that are good candidates for multiparty com-&lt;br/&gt;munication protocols. The analysis will include definition of formal models of the virtual topologies&lt;br/&gt;used, definition of appropriate metrics and statistical evaluation of random samples of the topologies,&lt;br/&gt;and discussion of complexity status of the relevant exact and approximate optimization problems.&lt;br/&gt;The protocol design stage will build on our analysis by using virtual topologies as the basis for&lt;br/&gt;communication protocols. Our emphasis will be on protocols that are feasible and practical to&lt;br/&gt;implement and will be based on simulation studies of the static properties of proposed graph struc-&lt;br/&gt;tures. Evaluation of the new protocols will utilize dynamic simulation to look at traffic capacities,&lt;br/&gt;delay, and fault tolerance recovery. Eventually, the developed protocols will be implemented and&lt;br/&gt;evaluated on a network testbed built with prior NSF support.&lt;br/&gt; The major contributions of this work will be a methodology for applying virtual topologies to&lt;br/&gt;Internet protocol design, formal models for these topologies, and new protocols for multicast rout-&lt;br/&gt;ing, reduction, and other communication paradigms. Further outcomes of our work will include&lt;br/&gt;a database of topologies used in our simulations, methods for modeling dynamic group member-&lt;br/&gt;ship and group distribution, and techniques for evaluation of fault tolerance properties of virtual&lt;br/&gt;topologies and protocols. The contributions to education will consist of training of graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students in network theory and engineering, and development and dissemination of&lt;br/&gt;curriculum materials for the design and evaluation of multiparty communication protocols.</data>

Large-scale electronic voting, for exam-&lt;br/&gt;ple, could use a many-to-one network service, with balloting results partially tabulated on the way&lt;br/&gt;to a central reporting service.&lt;br/&gt; Research from the fields of graph theory and parallel and distributed computing has solved many&lt;br/&gt;of these problems, albeit for environments that differ greatly from that of the Internet. The key to&lt;br/&gt;applying these results to Internet protocols is the use of a virtual topology that maps a theoretical&lt;br/&gt;substructure onto the physical network. As with the MBone, the links in the virtual topology could&lt;br/&gt;consist of some physical links and some virtual links implemented by encapsulation tunnels.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research first addresses limitations in current multicast routing protocols. The researchers&lt;br/&gt;propose to investigate the use of spanners as a virtual topology for densely-populated multicast&lt;br/&gt;groups, thus improving the efficiency of the periodic ooding used in this domain. For sparsely-&lt;br/&gt;populated groups, we propose to apply hypercube message passing algorithms used in parallel&lt;br/&gt;computation to the design of a more efficient and fault-tolerant multicast protocol. The researchers then plan&lt;br/&gt;to apply the techniques used for multicast virtual topologies to other multiparty communication&lt;br/&gt;paradigms. The researchers have identified promising research directions for reduction (many-to-one), subcast (one-to-some), and multi-source multicast (few-to-many).&lt;br/&gt; The project will progress in three main stages: analysis, protocol design and evaluation. The&lt;br/&gt;analysis stage is intended to identify virtual topologies that are good candidates for multiparty com-&lt;br/&gt;munication protocols. The analysis will include definition of formal models of the virtual topologies&lt;br/&gt;used, definition of appropriate metrics and statistical evaluation of random samples of the topologies,&lt;br/&gt;and discussion of complexity status of the relevant exact and approximate optimization problems.&lt;br/&gt;The protocol design stage will build on our analysis by using virtual topologies as the basis for&lt;br/&gt;communication protocols. Our emphasis will be on protocols that are feasible and practical to&lt;br/&gt;implement and will be based on simulation studies of the static properties of proposed graph struc-&lt;br/&gt;tures. Evaluation of the new protocols will utilize dynamic simulation to look at traffic capacities,&lt;br/&gt;delay, and fault tolerance recovery. Eventually, the developed protocols will be implemented and&lt;br/&gt;evaluated on a network testbed built with prior NSF support.&lt;br/&gt; The major contributions of this work will be a methodology for applying virtual topologies to&lt;br/&gt;Internet protocol design, formal models for these topologies, and new protocols for multicast rout-&lt;br/&gt;ing, reduction, and other communication paradigms.

      <data key="e_abstract">Very Large Instruction Word (VLIW) Application Specific Instruction-Set Processor (ASIP) cores realize performance/power/energy tradeoffs that can be very attractive in the exceedingly competitive embedded multimedia and signal processing market. In particular, specialized datapaths comprising clusters of functional units with associated (local) register files can enable significant performance/power/energy gains over those based on centralized register files. However, such specialized datapaths pose significant research and practical challenges. The proposed research focuses on jointly addressing (1) the synthesis of VLIW ASIP datapaths, and (2) the development of high-quality retargetable compilers for such specialized processors. The proposed methodology includes a novel problem phasing/decomposition that first considers the joint binding of operations and data objects to the functional units and register files of the specialized datapath. Complementary aggressive optimization heuristics will be developed to perform datapath dependent code transformations, exploit problem symmetries to dramatically reduce the search space, and to effectively bind/assign and schedule operations, data objects and data transfers onto the datapath&apos;s resources. If this research is successful, it will contribute to technologies that will increasingly provide the competitive edge&lt;br/&gt;for the embedded systems industry.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project combines the expertise developed in the numerical analysis community with that developed in algorithm design community to solve scientific problems governed by partial differential equations. Most of the effort will incorporate the analytical techniques from the numerical analysis area with the combinatorial &lt;br/&gt;techniques from the algorithms area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Central to this project is the design and analysis of new and novel meshing algorithms well suited for use with numerical techniques such as the finite element or finite volume methods. Special attention will be given to meshing in three dimensions. In particular, extension of algorithms developed under prior NSF grants will be constructed. These extensions include analyzable methods for both mesh refinement and coarsening. The more general problem of adaptive meshing for problems that are changing with time, such as solutions to singular and degenerate parabolic equations, will also be studied. The use of triangles and tetrahedra that may have small angles but no angles approaching 180 degrees will also be undertaken. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental to the project is the development of good methods to estimate the eigenvalues of graphs. These tools will be used to estimate convergence rates for preconditioned iterative system solvers, to estimate interpolation error for particular mesh algorithms, to compute error estimates for control volume methods, and to analyze spectral separator methods.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project studies robust and efficient methods for the numerical solution of ideal and resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), with applications to a variety of space physics applications. This will allow users to routinely perform simulations of such phenomena as cometary x-ray emission, the Earth&apos;s magnetosphere, and coronal mass ejections on current and future generations of massively parallel computer architectures. These MHD simulations are performed by block-based hierarchical adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) techniques for which the investigators have developed a highly efficient parallel implementation. Future applications to resistive MHD, however, require a more sophisticated time integration procedure to effectively deal with the large disparities of time scale associated with convection, magnetosonic and Alfven waves, and thermal transport. The researchers will investigate parallel implementations of both implicit Newton-Krylov-Schwarz (NKS) and full approximate storage (FAS) multigrid strategies in this context. In summary, the combination of robust finite-volume discretization of the governing equations, block-based AMR, domain decomposition, and parallel implementation of implicit NKS and/or multigrid strategies should yield an efficient, reliable, and powerful numerical method for large-scale simulation of MHD flows on high-performance parallel machines. Moreover, the resulting method should represent a significant improvement over the current generation of space plasma simulation tools and permit the study of a wider class of problems.</data>

The analog subsystems interface to the continuous,&lt;br/&gt;external world: wireless links, wired networks, sensors, transducers.&lt;br/&gt;Electronic design automation technology for the digital subsystems is&lt;br/&gt;relatively robust; automation for the analog subsystems is still primitive.&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing design automation methods for synthesis and&lt;br/&gt;layout of critical analog circuit blocks. The approach focuses on novel&lt;br/&gt;numerical and combinatorial optimization algorithms that can efficiently&lt;br/&gt;search over many circuit solution candidates. The goal is to be able to&lt;br/&gt;archive synthesizable descriptions of circuits as analog &quot;intellectual&lt;br/&gt;property&quot;, thus allowing them to be reused and retargeted in new&lt;br/&gt;applications</data>

      <data key="e_title">Modeling Pronunciation Variation for Universal Access to Speech Understanding</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">In order for speech-based interfaces to be universally accessible - that is, available to all citizens in all situations - they must deal successfully with massive variability in pronunciation, as studies have shown that this is by far the single largest source of error in machine speech recognition. This project will address that issue by building dynamic pronunciation models which use context to predict the most likely pronunciations of a word in a particular utterance. The PIs&apos; previous work has established that speakers are more likely to delete certain sounds (e.g., the final &quot;t&quot; in &quot;about&quot;) in a variety of situations: if the next word starts with certain consonants; if they are speaking quickly; if the word is unsurprising (has a high trigram probability); if they are young and male; if the word is not followed by a pause or a word-repetition; or if they are speakers of certain dialects. They have further shown how confidence metrics can be used to identify inaccurate dictionary pronunciations based on actual pronunciations in speech. This project will extend and combine both of these lines of research, by using phonetic-confidence models to identify words with incorrect pronunciations that contribute to word-error, and then building statistical (decision-tree) models of pronunciation variation for these words. The PIs&apos; model provides a general engine which they will apply to several specific classes of pronunciation variation, including dialect and speaker type, embedded in the Sphinx-II speech recognizer. The application of computational models to the study of pronunciation variation is an important new research area in linguistics and cognitive modeling, with implications for and potential benefits to many areas of science and pedagogy, including universal access.</data>

The PIs&apos; previous work has established that speakers are more likely to delete certain sounds (e.g., the final &quot;t&quot; in &quot;about&quot;) in a variety of situations: if the next word starts with certain consonants; if they are speaking quickly; if the word is unsurprising (has a high trigram probability); if they are young and male; if the word is not followed by a pause or a word-repetition; or if they are speakers of certain dialects. They have further shown how confidence metrics can be used to identify inaccurate dictionary pronunciations based on actual pronunciations in speech. This project will extend and combine both of these lines of research, by using phonetic-confidence models to identify words with incorrect pronunciations that contribute to word-error, and then building statistical (decision-tree) models of pronunciation variation for these words. The PIs&apos; model provides a general engine which they will apply to several specific classes of pronunciation variation, including dialect and speaker type, embedded in the Sphinx-II speech recognizer. The application of computational models to the study of pronunciation variation is an important new research area in linguistics and cognitive modeling, with implications for and potential benefits to many areas of science and pedagogy, including universal access.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This award provides funding to SUNY-Binghamton, for the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, &quot; Satellite Communication Networks: New Curriculum Development,&quot; Dr. Victor A. Skormin, Principal Investigator. Proliferation of satellite communication network technology has stimulated basic and applied research in the relevant areas and impacted the job market creating the demand for a large number of appropriately educated researchers and engineers. These trends present to universities not only potential sources for research funding but also stimuli for the development of new curricula. This project proposes a new electrical engineering curriculum-Satellite Communication Networks (SCN). The proposed curriculum will include four undergraduate and entry-level graduate courses, namely, Technology and Devices for Communications Satellites, Digital Satellite Communications, Control System Technology for Communication Satellites, and Optical Communications for Satellite Networks. Students enrolled in this curriculum will develop a background that will include relevant satellite technology, electronics and electro-optics, communications, signal processing, computer engineering, knowledge of control technologies, devices for laser beam steering, pointing-acquisition-tracking of satellites, and application of global positioning systems. In addition to theoretical concepts, the students will gain strong laboratory experience and exposure to advanced technologies and devices and will be well prepared to operate in high technology industrial environments as members of engineering and research teams.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Interference Avoidance In Wireless Systems</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The need for wireless access to data is widely cited. However, unlike the geometric growth of cellular (voice) wireless, wireless data has languished. There are many possible reasons, but the most striking is one of high cost. It therefore makes sense to reconsider some of the basic assumptions about wireless systems such as fixed proprietary infrastructure and licensed bandwidth which tend to raise the costs. Specifically, there is a need to understand at a fundamental level how systems can peacefully coexist when they mutually interfere in unlicensed bands (such as the recently allocated 5GHz U-NII bands) and may even co-inhabit the same areas. Thus, the proposed work will carefully explore an extremely simple design precept for use in such seemingly chaotic multi-system environments -- adjust transmitted waveforms and reception techniques to avoid interference -- &quot;interference avoidance&quot; for short.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the emergence of programmable digital radios prompts the consideration of wireless systems comprised of elements which can vary both their output waveforms and received-signal processing. It has already been shown that ensembles of adaptive transmitters communicating synchronously with a single receiver can OPTIMIZE their use of the wireless medium by practicing interference avoidance. The proposed work will deepen and extend the theoretical understanding of interference avoidance by considering asynchronous systems, dispersive channels, multi-element antenna arrays and probably most important, systems with multiple receivers. At each juncture, information theoretic bounds will be sought since these provide clear bounds on performance. In addition, practicalities such as convergence speed, quantization effects, channel measurements and systems level issues will be also considered.</data>

      <data key="e_title">General Purpose Routers for the Next Generation Internet</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">There has been tremendous pressure over the last several years to push functionality from end hosts onto network routers. Whether one calls the resulting systems routers, application gateways, active networks,&lt;br/&gt;proxies, or even topology-aware servers, a general trend was recognized: the logic that decides how to process packets has grown more and more complex over time. It is a contention that the potential&lt;br/&gt;for this trend to continue is almost unlimited, which suggests the question: what are the important properties for routers in the next generation Internet? The projects answer is a new router architecture, which they&lt;br/&gt;call a general purpose router (GPR), that supports arbitrarily complex forwarding logic. The GPR architecture has six unique features:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Performance: Provides the throughput required by the next generation Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Extensible: Easily extended to support new forwarding functions without compromising performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Scalable: Scales to relatively large sizes, on the order of a hundred of Gbps ports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Open: The hardware and software should be open so anyone can build or extend a router.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Commodity Components: Implemented using commercially available components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Robustness: Robust enough to tolerate programming mistakes and malicious attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bottom line is that the project recognizes a need for routers to move from being closed, special-purpose network devices to being open, general-purpose computing/communication systems. The central challenge&lt;br/&gt;in making this shift is to simultaneously support increasing complex forwarding logic and high performance, while using commercial hardware components and commercial operating systems. The GPR architecture&lt;br/&gt;achieves this through two key innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Better integration of the router&apos;s switching capacity and compute cycles. The project expects this to result in significantly better scaling properties, and an order of magnitude improvement in performance for packets that require only minimum processing cycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A hierarchy of paths through the router, ranging from fast/fixed paths implemented entirely in hardware to slow/programmable paths implemented entirely in software, but also including intermediate&lt;br/&gt; paths that exploit the improved integration of cycles and switching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to implementing the GPR architecture---and solving the configuration, scheduling, and resource management problems that doing so will entail---the project will design and implement several novel&lt;br/&gt;applications:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Edge routers that transition between different assumption regions of the Internet. Of particular note, the project will develop router functionality for deeply nested networks that include thin devices (e.g., embedded systems and low-power devices). The router needs to subsume some of the responsibility usually taken by the end node.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A scalable display system that consists of an array of parallel display processors (and associated frame buffers), each of which is responsible for some region of a wall-sized display. The router that&lt;br/&gt; serves as a front-end to this array---i.e., connects it to a graphics source--must fragment packets containing graphics directives and forward each fragment to the correct processor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; An internal firewall that implements enclaves and protects hosts within a site from each other. Unlike a firewall that sits at the edge of a site, such a router must authenticate users, enforce access control, log usage, and implement intrusion detection.</data>

The project expects this to result in significantly better scaling properties, and an order of magnitude improvement in performance for packets that require only minimum processing cycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A hierarchy of paths through the router, ranging from fast/fixed paths implemented entirely in hardware to slow/programmable paths implemented entirely in software, but also including intermediate&lt;br/&gt; paths that exploit the improved integration of cycles and switching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to implementing the GPR architecture---and solving the configuration, scheduling, and resource management problems that doing so will entail---the project will design and implement several novel&lt;br/&gt;applications:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Edge routers that transition between different assumption regions of the Internet. Of particular note, the project will develop router functionality for deeply nested networks that include thin devices (e.g., embedded systems and low-power devices). The router needs to subsume some of the responsibility usually taken by the end node.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A scalable display system that consists of an array of parallel display processors (and associated frame buffers), each of which is responsible for some region of a wall-sized display. The router that&lt;br/&gt; serves as a front-end to this array---i.e., connects it to a graphics source--must fragment packets containing graphics directives and forward each fragment to the correct processor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; An internal firewall that implements enclaves and protects hosts within a site from each other. Unlike a firewall that sits at the edge of a site, such a router must authenticate users, enforce access control, log usage, and implement intrusion detection.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The focus of this research is to develop a configurable client-side view storage system to reduce the cost of query processing and data shipping needs of distributed applications. The project aims to develop the theoretical basis of view management based on the notion of value order functions that imposes an order among a number of stored views. Value order functions can be defined by users employing a declarative language based on various properties of stored views. In this project, a prototype view management system is developed, called CAVES. It integrates view use and management functionalities into a single module with the help of two interconnected agents. The view use agent allows programmers to link view re-use methods to a database that helps CAVES maintain various statistics about the stored views. The view management agent applies general value ordering rules and optimization functions to this database to decide which views should be kept in storage. The effectiveness of different storage management policies and the performance of the system are tested with the help of a simulation model built on top of a high-performance parallel discrete-event simulation executive. The CAVES system will be used to improve the response time of client-server database systems by storing views that are computationally expensive or have high data shipping requirements at a client machine. The system will demonstrate that a dynamic collection of storage management protocols can outperform any static caching policy. The simulation system will provide the necessary methodology for selecting a set of protocols that are cost effective for a specific application. &lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~sibel/research/CAVES/</data>

      <data key="e_title">Hierarchical Lattice Parallelism</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The current generation of high-performance computers are hierachical multiprocessor machines. These computers can be an effective technology for solving challenging problems. However, their complexity leads to an array of tradeoffs in writing programs that hinders timely implementation. In particular, the built-in assumptions of a flat hierarchy in most existing parallel programming models makes it difficult to express efficient hierarchical algorithms needed on these machines. This project will compare two approaches to programming hierarchical parallel machines: an explicitly hierarchical model that is aware of the machine&apos;s structure, and a model that abstracts the communication to hide the hierarchy. Both models will be investigated by extending the KeLP2.0 framework, which provides support for masking communication latency (either hierarchical or not) by pipelining. This supports the design of application-specific overlap techniques. The investigators will carry out detailed performance studies of several applications, including Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of turbulent flows. The results of these will be incorporated in alternative implementation policies within the KeLP runtime system. The KeLP system will be made available to interested researchers as a possible platform for further investigation in hierarchical parallel programmig.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The goal of this research is to develop an intelligent visual database system that enables learning from user search patterns to automatically extract and annotate semantic objects in a large collection of images (i.e., learning by example). To this effect, the approach used in this project is based on a content-based hierarchical representation of images, where low-level homogeneous color regions (elementary regions) form the lowest level in the hierarchy. Higher-level (composite) nodes are formed by selected combinations of these regions that match in color and/or shape one or more example templates provided by the user. Composite nodes correspond to semantic objects that are generated automatically according to our learning by example procedure. A hierarchical content matching procedure is also developed, where the hierarchical image representation is searched in a top-down fashion. This procedure enables very efficient retrieval of images containing the &quot;learned&quot; objects in subsequent searches. The results of this research will yield procedures for automatic segmentation of semantic objects according to user provided example templates for automatic indexing of large visual databases, and very fast retrieval of images containing such objects in visual databases that employ the developed hierarchical content representation. &lt;br/&gt;http://www.ece.rochester.edu/~tekalp</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The Web provides thousands of resources for thousands of communities. However, these resources are difficult to locate and do not coordinate, resulting in unproductive experiences for users. The PIs propose an agent-based framework to reason about and retrieve appropriate materials, providing meaningful user guidance. These agents will be in the area of instructional technology and will employ user modeling and planning to provide robust performance despite changing availability of resources, modifications in the network configuration and variable user needs. Agents will communicate and select specialized learning resources to solve aspects of larger learning problems. They will negotiate distribution of learning tasks among available resources ensuring that all aspects of the total problem are addressed in a coordinated manner. A simulated large-scale on-line learning community will be constsructed to demonstrate the intended behavior. The simulation will simplify learning and tutoring yet will include conflict resolution and propose methods to avoid failure. It will illustrate qualitative, quantitative and visual benefits of the integrated community and explore the properties of on-line communities, anticipating and avoiding problems that arise as massive on-line learning communities develop. The PIs will demonstrate which techniques are productive, which impractical and which are scaleable in a massive network.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Information systems (IS) sourcing is an intricate phenomenon involving a multitude of actors, tasks, technology elements, service levels, reporting relationships, etc., in an environment of information asymmetry, incomplete contracts, and goal incongruency. This research develops a multi-theoretic contingency model of IS sourcing for effective governance of a firm&apos;s IS infrastructure in such a complex environment. The preliminary contingency model is based on economic and organizational theories of agency, transaction costs, incomplete contracts, resource dependence, etc. Qualitative secondary data and a focus group are initially used to refine the preliminary contingency model. The refined model is then empirically validated in the context of a specific industry using a two-shot longitudinal survey and quantitative content analysis of industry-specific secondary data. Results of this research will provide IS managers with a framework for designing appropriate sourcing configurations to achieve firm-specific sourcing objectives under different environmental conditions. They will also help create a better understanding about the dynamics of persistence of sourcing relationships. The results will, in addition, impact research concerned with the larger issue of IS performance management in the context of the virtual organizational form created and enabled through&lt;br/&gt;sourcing relationships.</data>

      <data key="e_title">CAREER: Fast and Accurate Computations of Applied Eigenproblems</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Eigenproblems appear ubiquitously all across applied science and &lt;br/&gt;engineering, and their efficient computations have become an &lt;br/&gt;integral part of related research and teaching. The research &lt;br/&gt;component of this proposal is concerned with numerical linear &lt;br/&gt;algebra problems that have significant impacts on related &lt;br/&gt;applications. Although the existing general purposed software &lt;br/&gt;libraries such as LINPACK, EISPACK, and LAPACK solve many common &lt;br/&gt;eigenvalue and singular value problems quite efficiently, many &lt;br/&gt;problems from applied science and engineering such as primary &lt;br/&gt;eigenvector computations for object recognition in image &lt;br/&gt;processing can be solved much more efficiently if their own &lt;br/&gt;intrinsic characteristics that are mostly ignored by general &lt;br/&gt;purpose libraries are incorporated properly. This project&lt;br/&gt;demonstrates that point of view with a preliminary and promising &lt;br/&gt;study that combines numerical linear algebra techniques and &lt;br/&gt;characteristics of image data to attack a huge eigenvalue &lt;br/&gt;(singular value) problem for a large set of high resolution &lt;br/&gt;images. The research objective is to exploit in depth the structural properties of applied problems from their &lt;br/&gt;application background and, consequently, will develop accurate &lt;br/&gt;and efficient algorithms. The research into relative perturbation theory and highly relative accurate methods for matrix computational problems has been extremely active in the last ten years, and exciting advances are being made. The results could have a significant impact on research in other disciplines that previously used conventional algorithms to carry out eigenproblem computations. The education component of this project is to implement a set of ideas and concrete projects, including the exploitation of new information technologies for more effective teaching such as avoiding too much time for students&apos; note taking, keeping constantly in touch with struggling students, and bringing math material alive in the classroom. The project is also concerned with modifying the curriculum of the existing two-semester numerical linear algebra courses to include applied problem lectures that ultimately will lead to a new course on solving applied computational problems.</data>

      <data key="e_title">A Unified Approach to Testing and Verification of Designs Synthesized from High-Level Specifications</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This research develops a unified framework for the test problems related to&lt;br/&gt;design verification and manufacturing tests. The design verification&lt;br/&gt;problem translates to the reachability problem in an extended finite state&lt;br/&gt;machine (EFSM) derived from the register-transfer-level specification.&lt;br/&gt;Design-verification tests correspond to input-output sequences tracing&lt;br/&gt;paths in the EFSM representation. They are derived by solving linear and&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear constraints involving data registers, internal buses, and primary&lt;br/&gt;inputs. Several search strategies for constraint solving are being explored&lt;br/&gt;based on our result that closed form solutions to linear constraints can be&lt;br/&gt;computed in polynomial time. Manufacturing tests are obtained by fully&lt;br/&gt;expanding partially specified verification vectors so as to achieve maximum&lt;br/&gt;coverage of faults in the gate-level circuit description. The verification&lt;br/&gt;and test sequences can be iteratively refined through feedback. The&lt;br/&gt;contributions of this research include modeling tools for complex circuits,&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for constraint- solving problem, and new measures of fault&lt;br/&gt;coverage.</data>

In this model, the &quot;bits&quot; are not acquired by a client, and thus there is limited trust in future availability. This project will attempt to solve this structural problem within the current model by applying innovative practices based on established librarian techniques. This project will explore development of a collaborative, easy-to-use, distributed replicated web cache. Libraries choose which journals to subscribe to and cache. If one is lost, it is easily replaced. The approach is innovative and if adopted on a wide scale will allow libraries to move confidently from paper subscriptions to electronic journals in many instances. Leading to dramatic improvements in efficiencies, economics, and capabilities of one important aspect of libraries services.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Because of its growth in size, scope, and complexity --- as well as its increasingly central role in society --- the Internet has become an important object of study and evaluation. Many significant innovations in the networking community in recent years have been directed at obtaining a more accurate understanding of the fundamental behavior of the complex system that is the Internet. These innovations have come in the form of better models of components of the system, better tools which enable us to measure the performance of the system more accurately, and new techniques coupled with performance evaluation which have delivered better system utilization. The continued development and improvement of our understanding of the properties of the Internet is essential to guide designers of hardware, protocols, and applications for the next decade of Internet growth.&lt;br/&gt; As a research community, an important next step would involve an introspective look at the challenges that lie ahead in this area. This would entail an assessment of the progress that has been made to date, an evaluation of both the unsolved challenges and the challenges that the Internet will present us with in the near future, and a discussion of the promising new techniques that innovators in the field are currently developing. To this end, the Networking Research Group at Boston University propose a one-day workshop with this agenda to be held at Boston University on Monday, August 30, 1999 and which will immediately precede SIGCOMM &apos;99.&lt;br/&gt; The BU/NSF Internet Measurement, Instrumentation and Characterization(IMIC) workshop will feature four sessions: (1) Modeling and Characterization; (2) Internet Instrumentation and Measurement; (3) End-to-End Protocols and Services; (4) Network Support for Next Generation Internet Applications. Each session will consist of 3 presentations to be followed by an open discussion. The workshop will conclude with a panel of researchers from academia and industry, as well as representatives from funding agencies, who will discuss opportunities and challenges that lie ahead, and initiatives to be undertaken. Proceedings of the workshop will be made available on-line as an NSF report.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This research will identify the factors that lead to the formation, maintenance and dissolution of dynamically linked knowledge networks. Two core research questions will be addressed: How do diverse knowledge networks co-evolve over time and at multiple levels? How do the centrality, density, diffusion and other properties of knowledge networks at each level affect task performance by individuals, groups and organizations? The PIs plan to adopt a broad, generic approach to understanding the co-evolution of knowledge networks. Knowledge networks may share important common structural properties across levels, or may develop in similar ways. Where that proves to be true, theories at one level can be expanded to apply to networks at several levels; where network properties diverge, existing theories will be modified and new ones developed. The theory generated by this research, the computational models tested and the statistical techniques developed will have important scientific implications beyond the substantive research findings of this project; they will be applicable to human networks in other contexts as well as to a variety of knowledge and network issues in society, and will also significantly enhance future statistical analysis of many forms of networks.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">EIA 9979833&lt;br/&gt;Kurose, James F.&lt;br/&gt;Univ of Massachusetts, Amherst&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CISE Educational Innovation: Creating a flexible undergraduate program in computer science: curriculum, educational technology and pedagogy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CISE Educational Innovation project provides funds to develop a new undergraduate curriculum that facilitates rapid inclusion of research, incorporates advances in educational technology, and encourages innovation in teaching and in student learning. The project involves a consortium of five colleges, the several units of the University of Massachusetts, and utilizes the experiences in distance education, industrial relations, and technology transfer of the department. The project addresses four areas: curriculum development; educational technology; new pedagogy; and leveraging partnerships. The project seeks to achieve three goals: to maintain the curriculum at the cutting edge of telecommunications and computing; to accommodate students with varied backgrounds, motivations and educational goals; and to motivate faculty to evolve and adopt new educational pedagogy. Assessment and evaluation are incorporated in the project from the beginning and it is expected that the project will have a significant impact in undergraduate education.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">More and more organizations are attempting to work long distance. Since travel is time consuming, exhausting, and costly, they are turning to remote technologies, such as video and audio-conferencing. High quality video, of course, is much more expensive than audio, and questions arise as to its efficacy and necessity. This proposal asks two broad questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Under what conditions/tasks is the addition of video over audio truly beneficial?&lt;br/&gt;2. What effect do various conditions of video degradation have on user performance?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on the effect of the presence or absence of video on tasks deemed key to long-term teams, involving the establishment and maintenance of trust and the detection of deception. In addition, we test how various reasonable degradations of the channels, those commonly used in making the cost of the connection cheaper, change people&apos;s behavior in these situations. This work has both theoretical and practical import. Theoretically, it reveals which cues people use when they engage in important social interactions that underlie task-related activities. Practically, we will be able to provide advice for people who might find themselves in situations involving the building of trust or the detection of lying when that interaction is done remotely.</data>

The goal of this project is to develop and apply a design methodology for mixed analog/asynchronous circuits. This project uses driving examples from the field of communications due to their challenging performance and power demands. The asynchronous nature of communications systems coupled with recent analog implementations of probability propagation algorithms (PPA), a key operation in such systems as turbo codes, makes this field a prime target for potential gains. This project extends the work in the area of iterative decoding using probability propagation to develop algorithms and architectures which can take advantage of the properties of a mixed analog/asynchronous system. This project also applies CAD tools for timed asynchronous circuits to design these systems.

      <data key="e_abstract">While current wireless communications systems offer acceptable performance for transmission of voice and simple digital data such as e-mail and paging services, they cannot adequately support the higher data rates required for example by graphics-rich multimedia applications or video conferencing. This throughput limitation must be overcome in order to meet the growing desire for instant information accessibility regardless of one&apos;s location around the world, sometimes referred to as &quot;global seamless roaming&quot;. Until recently, it was believed that the primary obstacle to higher data rates in wireless systems was due to multipath -- the scattering of a signal along many different paths due to objects between the transmitter and receiver. However, remarkable new research suggests just the opposite; in particular, it has been demonstrated that if multiple antennas are used on both ends of a multipath-rich communications link, and appropriate digital &quot;space-time&quot; codes are employed, then dramatic increases in throughput can be achieved. Intuitively, this is because each propagation path offers a separate ``independent&apos;&apos; channel over which data can be transmitted. To take advantage of these spatially and temporally diverse channels, antenna arrays are required on both the receive and transmit ends of the link. This obviously leads to an increase in system complexity, and raises questions concerning what type of communication protocols must be used when multiple Tx and Rx (MTRx) antennas are employed. These are issues addressed by this research project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are conducting a thorough assessment of the design, implementation, testing, and performance analysis of MTRx wireless communications systems. Specific tasks include the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1)Experimental space-time channel characterization and modeling for indoor and outdoor wireless channels -- Design and implementation of a flexible, low-cost MIMO data acquisition system capable of efficiently measuring spatial and temporal channel characteristics in various settings as well as for different antenna directivity and polarization properties; Development of statistical models that provide an accurate description of the MIMO channel space-time characteristics based upon fits to the observed data; Utilization of the model in assessing the validity of the assumptions used in the development of MTRx algorithms, and the degradation in performance of the algorithms when model mismatch occurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2)Analysis of how space-time algorithms based on idealized assumptions fare in real multipath environments -- An investigation of how imprecisely known channels degrade performance, how accurately the channel must be known in order to obtain acceptably error-free data transfer; A study of how frequency selective channels degrade the performance of algorithms that assume flat fading; A determination of the effects of channel non-stationarities such as Doppler on space-time algorithm performance and on how often the channel be updated for reasonable performance; Analysis of the effect of co-channel interference and models for taking it into account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3)The development of new, practical strategies for space-time processing that are robust to realistic channel effects and geared to multiple user access -- Investigation of space-time error control coding strategies for real channels, with a focus on 3-dimensional interleaver design, space-time ARQ and hybrid-ARQ, and space-time code-combining; Implementation of various multiple access protocols using MTRx wireless systems, including a study of space, time, frequency, and code division multiple access, as well as packet-based approaches; Development of appropriate MIMO channel estimators to be used with the space-time processing algorithms requiring reliable channel state information.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">9979448&lt;br/&gt;Van Veen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An integrated program of research is proposed for exploiting all available modes of diversity in the wireless channel. This requires the development of novel antennas for transmitting in diverse modes, digital receivers for exploiting these modes, and dynamic resources allocations for assigning them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary challenges in this research are to manage and exploit the complex and time varying nature of the wireless communication channel, while meeting the power and bandwidth constraints of mobiles, base stations and networks. Hence, the work emphasizes integration of digital receivers for multiaccess communication with smart antennas and dynamic resource allocation. The smart antenna excites the temporal, spatial, and polarizational modes in the wireless channel. The multiuse receiver uses these modes to decode mobile users and to estimate channel parameters, which are used by the dynamic resource allocator to provide the required QoS to end users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design of a high frequency (e.g., 30 Ghz), high bandwidth radiating and receiving antenna which is agile in space, time, and polarization will involve numerical modeling, device construction, and testing of a prototype, based on prior experience with millimeter wave lens antennas. The design of multiaccess receivers which exploit available degrees of freedom will be based on actual device characteristics and on realistic scattering models for the channel. These receivers will be designed and implemented in reduced dimension subspaces. These subspaces are generated by resolving the real channel into a parallel combination of virtual diversity channels, using a special canonical space-time coordinate system. The designs will be evaluated using the software radio testbed currently under development at Eurecom.. The innovative aspect of the proposed dynamic network allocation work is the shared use of information at the physical and network layers to jointly optimize the use of channel and network resources for ensuring QoS. Dynamic resource allocation will exploit all the channel modes made available by the antennas and receivers. Estimates of signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and bit error rate (BER) will be shared between the physical and network layers to dynamically allocate power and bandwidth across different channel modes, while keeping signaling and receiver complexity manageable. This integrated research program will influence the conception, development, and implementation of future wireless communication networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key element of this project is the integration of student and faculty research activities at three universities: the University of Wisconsin, the University of Colorado, and Eurecom in France, the later a recipient of an IEEE Education Award for its innovative integration of mobile wireless, multimedia, and networking. The likelihood of success I this collaborative program is high, because working relationships between the three schools have been established through prior visits, sabbaticals, and collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The management plan is built around regular visits between laboratories at the participating schools, and joint advising of students working at technology boundaries. The integrated perspective developed in this research program will be incorporated into a new undergraduate wireless communication laboratory, a graduate colloquium course, and a wireless communication reading course. This work will impact the content of existing courses in communications, signal processing, networks, antennas, and electromagnetics.&lt;br/&gt;***</data>

This integrated research program will influence the conception, development, and implementation of future wireless communication networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key element of this project is the integration of student and faculty research activities at three universities: the University of Wisconsin, the University of Colorado, and Eurecom in France, the later a recipient of an IEEE Education Award for its innovative integration of mobile wireless, multimedia, and networking. The likelihood of success I this collaborative program is high, because working relationships between the three schools have been established through prior visits, sabbaticals, and collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The management plan is built around regular visits between laboratories at the participating schools, and joint advising of students working at technology boundaries. The integrated perspective developed in this research program will be incorporated into a new undergraduate wireless communication laboratory, a graduate colloquium course, and a wireless communication reading course. This work will impact the content of existing courses in communications, signal processing, networks, antennas, and electromagnetics.&lt;br/&gt;***</data>

      <data key="e_title">Improved Discretization Methods for Modeling Wavefront Conduction in Nonuniform Cardiac Tissue</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Investigations into the relative roles of tissue structure and membrane&lt;br/&gt;Excitability recovery on creating conditions for arrhythmias in the heart have proven to&lt;br/&gt;be extremely challenging. Computer models of wavefront propagation have been&lt;br/&gt;important to the inquiry by allowing effects to be isolated and by providing access to&lt;br/&gt;some of the parameters that cannot be monitored or controlled in a given experimental&lt;br/&gt;setup. Due to limitations in the traditionally employed numerical methods, however,&lt;br/&gt;these computer models have either ignored or greatly simplified the effects of structural&lt;br/&gt;and geometrical non-uniformities on the activation process. Consequently, most&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms for arrhythmogenesis derived from them are generally based on the&lt;br/&gt;effects of non-uniformities of membrane properties in tissue with assumed uniform&lt;br/&gt;material properties. For macroscopic models of the heart to have greater predictive&lt;br/&gt;ability they must be able to incorporate the effects of diseased-induced tissue structure&lt;br/&gt;inhomogeneities on conduction and potential timecourses. The objectives of this &lt;br/&gt;proposal are to develop improved discretization schemes for robustly modeling&lt;br/&gt;conduction in regions with spatially varying material and membrane properties. These&lt;br/&gt;objectives will be accomplished by creating a unified meltherhatical and computational&lt;br/&gt;framework for simulation that will allow different numerical methods to be directly&lt;br/&gt;compared. The simulation system, BIDOSIM, will use a module-based paradigm from&lt;br/&gt;which a single &quot;sun-time environment&quot; can be created. This approach will allow any advances made in any one component to lead directly to an advancement of the whole&lt;br/&gt;program. This modularity will thus enable developers from different disciplines to focus&lt;br/&gt;on their own area of expertise (i.e model description, numerical integration methods,&lt;br/&gt;parallelization) without needing to simultaneously work on the other areas. BIDOSIM&lt;br/&gt;will be used to evaluate the use of structured and unstructured finite volume methods,&lt;br/&gt;that involve quadrilateral and triangular grids, to discretize the computational domains&lt;br/&gt;of interest. The speed, accuracy and ability of both types of methods will be examined&lt;br/&gt;using explicit and implicit time stepping algorithms. To ensure that the spatial&lt;br/&gt;discretization methods are able to accommodate any advances in the dynamical models of the ion fluxes across the membrane state-of-the-art kinetic models, such as the Lucfludy II ventricular and Nygren atrial models, will be evaluated over a range of physiological conditions. Finally, strategies for using spatially adaptive gridding in regions with abrupt changes in tissue properties, such as those expected in diseased myocardium, will be developed. Such adaptation will allow significantly fewer grid points and enable the ability to distinguish better artifact from true behavior. The development of the overall software package will be enhanced through feedback from an outside group of users and dissemination will be facilitated through partnerships with two national centers, NCSA and the Center for Bioelectric Field Simulation.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">EIA-9977508&lt;br/&gt;Sohn, Andrew&lt;br/&gt;McHugh, James A.&lt;br/&gt;New Jersey Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MRI: A PC-based Multithreading Environment for Solving Grand Computation Problems in Science and Engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to explore an alternative to the expensive parallel computing, called cluster computing. The main idea is to develop and build a low-cost yet powerful parallel computer that consists of inexpensive dual-processor personal computers connected via commodity switchers and network cards. To overcome the long communication latencies associated with general purpose switches, it is proposed to combine the multithreading and communication co-processor capability. In this approach, each processor of a dual-processor PC has itself a dual role, acting both as a computation processor and a communication processor. Using software-enabled fine-grain multithreading, the duality of each processor allows the overlap of computation with communication, thus masking the long communication. The proposed architecture is designed to provide performance scalability and cost scalability. The principal result of the proposed research will be a cluster of PCs which can be used either as a powerful parallel computer to provide capabilities for computational science and engineering problems, or as a stable, scalable Web server as would be suitable for electronic commerce, and which at the same time can be used as a desktop computer for daily computing needs.</data>

This Project is a component of the InterLib collaboration between University of California at Berkeley, the University of California at Santa Barbara, and Stanford University. The combined interLib technologies will be demonstrated on the emerging California Digital Library (CDL), and on a testbed developed by the San Diego Supercomputer Center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alexandria Digital Earth Prototype (ADEPT) Project will develop digital library environments and services that are based on the Digital Earth Metaphor. The services will support access to, and use of, heterogeneous digital information distributed across the Internet on the basis of georeference as well as other criteria. In particular the system will support the construction and use of personalized digital information collections called Iscapes (Information Landscapes). A variety of services will be provided that allow Iscapes to be developed as information service layers in which diverse information resources can be organized, accessed, and used. A characteristic feature of Iscapes is the creation of special meta-information resources indicating the joint usability of the items in the personalized collections. The project will focus on developing services that support the construction and use of Iscapes for use in learning contexts and for the creation of knowledge across a range of disciplines, including the arts, humanities, and social, physical, ] and biological sciences. The Project will focus specific attention on evaluating the effect of ADEPT services on learning in undergraduate classroom situations.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Be it a school of fish swimming gracefully through the water, a herd of deer running through a meadow, a flock of birds flying across the horizon, or a swarm of bees circling about a hive one cannot help but wonder how these and other similar natural groupings, coordinate themselves and move so flawlessly, often without an apparent leader or any form of centralized control. What kinds of signaling must they use? What role if any, do currents, vortices, or other local environmental disturbances play in this process? Are there universal principles of coordinated group motion and if so what might they be? How might they be used to design a school of autonomous submerged vehicles, or a group of ground-based or airborne mobile robots to collectively accomplish a useful task in a coordinated manner? In broad terms, these are the questions to which this research will be addressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, we propose to mount a cross-disciplinary assault on the joint problems of understanding how fish schools coordinate their collective motion and how schools of autonomous submerged vehicles might be designed to move in a coordinated manner. We propose to address these problems experimentally, theoretically and by means of computer simulation. At the theoretical level, our aims will be to develop models, which are biologically plausible, and, in addition, operating strategies will enable coordinated group motion of engineered systems. Our ultimate goal is not to derive analytical models nor to develop computer simulations, which are visually satisfactory, but rather to discover the underlying concepts upon which the coordination of group motion might depend. Thus, for example we would hope to develop concepts which, on the one hand might help to explain how fish maintain their spacing and, on the other might serve as guidelines for the design of groupings of man-made autonomous vehicles of all types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experimental thrust of this research will proceed in two distinct but parallel directions. With the objective of gathering the world&apos;s first data-base documenting the long-term, three-dimensional motions of individual fish within a large school, we will take timed sequences of stereo video images of actual fish schools living in a large {1000 gallon or more} tank. We will image the responses of schools to various stimuli and under various conditions. Using advanced image/vision processing techniques, we will transform this data into a form suitable for verifying the validity of proposed behavioral and analytical schooling models. This database together with full documentation will be made available to the science and engineering communities via the World Wide Web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the objective of trying out candidate group coordination strategies in a reasonably realistic setting, we will develop an experimental test facility consisting of a school of approximately a dozen, identical miniature underwater vehicles. These experiments are expected to be useful for both the biological and the engineering perspectives; we will be able to test robotic versions of hypothesized biology models not possible in a fish tank. Experiments with this man-made school will be carried out in an Olympic-sized swimming pool, which is available at Princeton University. Our first goal will be to instrument these vehicles so that they can function autonomously, without remote control. We will then experiment with a variety of maneuvers including group formation, cruising, bifurcating, avoiding obstacles, and changing group shapes. We will implement various biologically inspired goal-seeking strategies such as foraging as well as gradient climbing tasks relevant both to biology and to numerous engineering applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research we are proposing will be carried out by a cross-disciplinary team consisting of experimental and theoretical biologists together with experts in computer vision, control systems and robotics. It is our view that by means of this multi-pronged assault consisting of theoretical analysis, computer simulation, and experimentation with both natural and man-made groups, we can attain an understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing the coordinated motion of natural and man-made groups.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Be it a school of fish swimming gracefully through the water, a herd of deer running through a meadow, a flock of birds flying across the horizon, or a swarm of bees circling about a hive one cannot help but wonder how these and other similar natural groupings, coordinate themselves and move so flawlessly, often without an apparent leader or any form of centralized control. What kinds of signaling must they use? What role if any, do currents, vortices, or other local environmental disturbances play in this process? Are there universal principles of coordinated group motion and if so what might they be? How might they be used to design a school of autonomous submerged vehicles, or a group of ground-based or airborne mobile robots to collectively accomplish a useful task in a coordinated manner? In broad terms, these are the questions to which this research will be addressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, we propose to mount a cross-disciplinary assault on the joint problems of understanding how fish schools coordinate their collective motion and how schools of autonomous submerged vehicles might be designed to move in a coordinated manner. We propose to address these problems experimentally, theoretically and by means of computer simulation. At the theoretical level, our aims will be to develop models, which are biologically plausible, and, in addition, operating strategies will enable coordinated group motion of engineered systems. Our ultimate goal is not to derive analytical models nor to develop computer simulations, which are visually satisfactory, but rather to discover the underlying concepts upon which the coordination of group motion might depend. Thus, for example we would hope to develop concepts which, on the one hand might help to explain how fish maintain their spacing and, on the other might serve as guidelines for the design of groupings of man-made autonomous vehicles of all types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experimental thrust of this research will proceed in two distinct but parallel directions. With the objective of gathering the world&apos;s first data-base documenting the long-term, three-dimensional motions of individual fish within a large school, we will take timed sequences of stereo video images of actual fish schools living in a large {1000 gallon or more} tank. We will image the responses of schools to various stimuli and under various conditions. Using advanced image/vision processing techniques, we will transform this data into a form suitable for verifying the validity of proposed behavioral and analytical schooling models. This database together with full documentation will be made available to the science and engineering communities via the World Wide Web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the objective of trying out candidate group coordination strategies in a reasonably realistic setting, we will develop an experimental test facility consisting of a school of approximately a dozen, identical miniature underwater vehicles. These experiments are expected to be useful for both the biological and the engineering perspectives; we will be able to test robotic versions of hypothesized biology models not possible in a fish tank.

      <data key="e_abstract">Human gesture, speech, and gaze (GSG) function as an integrated whole, no&lt;br/&gt;part of which may be fully understood in isolation. Since they are not&lt;br/&gt;subservient to each other, but spring from a &apos;deeper&apos; semantic source in&lt;br/&gt;the human mind, they provide a glimpse into the function of the mind in the&lt;br/&gt;production of human communication. Our multi-institutional&lt;br/&gt;cross-disciplinary team will study this GSG nexus in two major sets of&lt;br/&gt;activities. First, there is a technological focus on the computation,&lt;br/&gt;extraction, representation and access to the communicative entities&lt;br/&gt;contained in multi-view video of human communication experiments. This&lt;br/&gt;involves video analysis, speech/signal processing, and web-based multimedia&lt;br/&gt;databases. Second, we have assembled six science projects, two each in&lt;br/&gt;psycholinguistics/anthropological linguistics, speech and natural language&lt;br/&gt;understanding, and neuropathology. The technology research enables the&lt;br/&gt;science projects, which in turn focus the technology research. In brief&lt;br/&gt;the six projects investigate: 1. How multiple communication modalities may&lt;br/&gt;be fused to provide cogent discourse structure, 2. How spatial expressions&lt;br/&gt;function in languages (like Tzotzil in Chiapas Mexico) that apply&lt;br/&gt;&apos;absolute&apos; orienting strategies, 3. How GSG may be combined to yield more&lt;br/&gt;accurate speech and natural language processing, 4. How GSG may be used to&lt;br/&gt;locate, and understand discourse disfluencies, 5. How GSG synchronies vary&lt;br/&gt;in Parkinson&apos;s disease patients, and 6. How aphasia interacts with&lt;br/&gt;language and culture.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Recommender systems have emerged as a practical tool for helping users alleviate information overload. Early systems served close-knit communities, but required substantial effort from the users. Later systems evolved to serve many users at low effort, but hid the recommendation mechanism and left the users anonymous to each other. This project restores balance between community and understandable processes, on the one hand, and serving larger populations with less effort, on the other. In doing so, it explores how the design of recommender systems affects their value to users. The project explores three types of questions by developing and studying new interfaces in the context of an existing recommender system. First, it examines interfaces that increase user control or understanding (e.g., explanations and user-controlled recommendations). Second it looks as interfaces that foster community (e.g., persistent identities and text reviews). Finally it assesses user behavior when provided with interfaces to select their own communities. This project results in a better understanding of how users interact in on-line communities built around information filtering needs. The knowledge gained will be useful to designers of filtering systems and on-line communities as they strive to better address information overload through on-line collaboration.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This research addresses a number of challenges related to the full realization of the potential of supply chain infrastructures(SCIs), which include those software systems used to support enterprise requirements planning (ERP) and supply chain management (SCM). A software testbed, which initially will include an SCM component, an ERP component and a middleware component, will be constructed. The research will employ techniques from operations research, computer science and empirical information systems. Integer programming based resource allocation models will be developed and embedded within a simulation.

Research on the development of mechanisms for effective query processing in web-like settings will be pursued with the goal of improving efficient SCI implementation in large organizations.

A software testbed, which initially will include an SCM component, an ERP component and a middleware component, will be constructed. The research will employ techniques from operations research, computer science and empirical information systems. Integer programming based resource allocation models will be developed and embedded within a simulation. The simulation will be used in conjunction with two empirical studies of organizational decision making to explore the relationships between SCIs and organization structure. Research on the development of mechanisms for effective query processing in web-like settings will be pursued with the goal of improving efficient SCI implementation in large organizations. ERP and SCM systems are achieving significant levels of deployment throughout the world. The research undertaken here is aimed at improving the efficiency of&lt;br/&gt;these systems and their effectiveness in enhancing organizational performance.&lt;br/&gt; Practical contributions are anticipated in the following areas: improvements in the understanding&lt;br/&gt;of how information technology impacts organizations and the how organizations should adapt to take advantage of new SCI technology; the development of decision models that both explain how supply chain decision making should take place in organizations and provide new techniques for supply chain decision support; new methods for efficiently implementing scalable web-based applications.</data>

      <data key="e_title">COMPASS: Composable and Parallel Simulation of Internetworks</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The unprecedented, exponential growth of the Internet has far outstripped the capacity of the&lt;br/&gt;tools needed to analyze modern networks. Simulation remains the method of choice for network&lt;br/&gt;designers, researchers, and managers for many analysis problems. However, modern simulation&lt;br/&gt;tools are typically limited to analyzing tens to hundreds of network nodes, while studies of&lt;br/&gt;current and future networks such as the next generation Internet call for analyses of thousands to&lt;br/&gt;millions. New, practical approaches to network modeling and simulation are needed to address&lt;br/&gt;this growing problem.&lt;br/&gt; Two frequently heard problems with simulation technology today are (1) the excessive amount&lt;br/&gt;of time required to construct a model for a large network, and (2) the inordinate amount of&lt;br/&gt;computer time required to execute the resulting simulation program. This project, called&lt;br/&gt;COMPASS (COMposable and PArallel Simulation of internetworkS), will attack the first&lt;br/&gt;problem by defining and realizing an approach to enable rapid construction of network models&lt;br/&gt;by reusing model components developed by others, possibly using different simulation software&lt;br/&gt;packages. The second problem will be attacked through execution of the model on parallel&lt;br/&gt;and/or distributed computers. In this regard, this project will focus on realizing a practical,&lt;br/&gt;flexible, approach to parallelization that can be widely exploited by the networking community.&lt;br/&gt;This approach, based on composing (federating) autonomous simulators executing on different&lt;br/&gt;processors, cleanly separates the parallel and sequential portions of the simulation, allowing&lt;br/&gt;concurrent optimization and refinement of each. A related problem that will be studied concerns&lt;br/&gt;execution of models over a geographically distributed area in situations where model&lt;br/&gt;components cannot be easily co-located.&lt;br/&gt; To demonstrate this approach, an optimized parallel/distributed implementation of the ns2&lt;br/&gt;simulator will be realized as part of this project. This software will be realized on widely&lt;br/&gt;available computing platforms and will be made freely available to the networking community in&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with the VINT/ns group at USC/ISI. Because ns2 is widely used in the networking&lt;br/&gt;community, the potential impact of this project is large. Moreover, the ability to easily reuse&lt;br/&gt;network models developed by others using different simulation packages can lead to a paradigm&lt;br/&gt;shift in the way modeling and simulation is routinely practiced in the networking community.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, simulation of multicast protocols will be used as a vehicle to evaluate and refine the&lt;br/&gt;parallel simulation designs and demonstrate their effectiveness. Multicast protocols have a&lt;br/&gt;particularly strong need for scalable simulation tools. It is an area where new ideas and&lt;br/&gt;proposals are still being generated. Research in this project will focus on multicast protocols that&lt;br/&gt;are of current interest to the Internet community; reliable multicast, layered video multicast and&lt;br/&gt;data dissemination applications will be studied. This work will not only provide a proof of&lt;br/&gt;concept for the parallel simulation research, but will also provide an improved evaluation&lt;br/&gt;capability to the networking community for solutions to problems of current interest.</data>

The proposed solution enables optical transmission of both individual IP packets and large quantities of traffic comprising multiple IP packets using a novel control technique that allows on-demand establishment of optical circuits -- the so-called lightpaths or wavelength routes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The postdoctoral research associate is being specifically trained to develop comprehensive knowledge of the current network infrastructure and identify the current drawbacks and bottlenecks that prevent the realization of a flexible telecommunications network capable of providing on-demand bandwidth to the user. The research plan includes an evaluation of the impacts of the proposed solution on the current network, specifically addressing how the drawbacks and bottlenecks of the extant network are circumvented. A considerable effort is devoted to investigate potential ways to make the proposed solution compatible with and transparent to the end user&apos;s equipment.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Innovative Algorithms and Techniques for Large Scale Simulations</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This project aims to develop a variety of robust, effective, and parallelizable solvers and preconditioners for sparse linear systems arising from finite element modeling and dense linear systems arising from boundary element modeling approaches. As is evidenced from our preliminary results, a careful cross-breeding of techniques from these two areas is capable of yielding the breakthrough needed in designing effective parallel preconditioners and solvers. The techniques proposed for sparse linear systems are based on a hierarchy of representations using block low-rank matrices and multipole approximations of the inverse. The project will study the implications of these techniques for compression schemes used in approximate dense linear system solvers as well. The project will also investigate algebraic multilevel techniques for sparse linear systems in which hiearchical representations are used to obtain an alternate preconditioned system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parallel formulations of all these techniques will be developed along with theoretical estimates for convergence and parallel performance. In addition to these, this study will investigate projection-based &lt;br/&gt;techniques that affect preconditioning implicitly through a set of concurrent projections onto appropriate subspaces. Such techniques include row-projection methods and are robust forms of approximate &lt;br/&gt;inverse preconditioners.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Commercial computing workloads, such as on-line transaction&lt;br/&gt;processing, file-serving, data mining, and web-serving, currently&lt;br/&gt;represent about 85 percent of the overall market for large computing&lt;br/&gt;systems. Nevertheless, much of the computer architecture research&lt;br/&gt;to date has focused on improving the capability of computer systems&lt;br/&gt;to access, process, and store the large arrays of data common to&lt;br/&gt;numerically-intensive workloads. The implicit assumption has been&lt;br/&gt;that all types of computer systems would benefit from the&lt;br/&gt;architectural innovations developed for these applications. To&lt;br/&gt;address this disparity between the economic importance of commercial&lt;br/&gt;computing systems and the traditional architecture development focus&lt;br/&gt;on technical computing systems, this project is developing the&lt;br/&gt;Flexible Architectural Cores for Commercial Computing Systems&lt;br/&gt;processor architecture. This new architecture is based on the&lt;br/&gt;observation that the constantly changing behavior in a commercial&lt;br/&gt;computing environment causes different architectural innovations to&lt;br/&gt;be applicable during different phases of execution. A unique aspect&lt;br/&gt;of this project that will significantly enhance its relevance to&lt;br/&gt;commercial computing environments is the close collaboration of the&lt;br/&gt;IBM Corporation&apos;s commercial microprocessor development group in&lt;br/&gt;Rochester, Minnesota. This project will make substantial&lt;br/&gt;contributions to educational and human resource development through&lt;br/&gt;graduate student research and interaction with industry.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Adaptive Balanced Computing Architecture</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Applications, such as multimedia processing, digital signal, image and vision processing, and scientific computing, generate computation tasks that are structured and repetitive exhibiting varying degree of instruction-level parallelism (ILP). Moreover, the demands to compute certain functions and their&lt;br/&gt;resource needs vary with applications and time. The overall goal of this project is to develop and use novel ideas such as reconfigurable functional units (FUs), cache memory, and reconfigurable bus architectures to achieve balanced computing, i.e. match the computing bandwidth to the memory bandwidth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will address issues in designing architectures that allow reconfiguration of resources to make the following architecture level parameters dynamically variable: number and types of FUs, amount of on-chip register and cache memory, an ability to trade the on-chip memory resources with the number&lt;br/&gt;of FUs dynamically, and the interconnectivity between these units. A processor core with reconfigurable logic blocks to make the architecture adaptive to the applications&apos; computing and memory bandwidth needs will be developed. Effects of integrating reconfiguration schemes into the on-chip FUs and cache memories&lt;br/&gt;on a processor chip will also be studied and evaluated. A high-level design for the ABC (Adaptive Balanced Computing) architecture will be developed and analyzed. It is expected that the research results will significantly improve the efficiency of computation.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project will produce a faithful 3D animation of the face of a speaker, accurately articulating visible speech, and preserving the natural synchronism between the utterances of the speaker and the corresponding facial movements, including as much of the gestural prosody as possible. This is accomplished through a series of transformations from the speech input to the display. From the phonetic perspective the PIs will study the relation between phonemes and visemes at a level of granularity below the phoneme. From the computer graphics perspective, they will model the facial features so that realistic synchronism with the utterances takes place using the computer vision technique of active contours and the animation technique of multilayer implicit models. Finally, from a prosodic point of view they will apply the concepts of gestural scores which should account, on a more principled basis, for the prosodic phenomena and contextual influences in speech. The gestural model has evolved into a novel task-dynamic approach to invariant articulatory gestures based on an orchestration (by means of a rather parsimonious &quot;score&quot;) of a second order spring-mass system reaching for target specific goals. An acoustic features table includes the phasing and duration which characterize gestural scores. This work has important implications not only for animation (films and television, interfaces for the hearing impaired, low bandwidth telephony, repeatable prosody), but also for basic linguistic modeling of prosody across the two languages (English and Spanish) being considered.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This research involves a novel adaptive and scalable wireless network architecture utilizing a mixture of cellular and packet radio network topologies for broadband multimedia communications. The architecture enables rapid adaptability to traffic, channel and interference conditions and will result in significant reductions in transmit power and potential throughput improvements. We investigate techniques that, by coordination among physical, data link, and network layers enable significant improvements in capacity and quality of service relative to the current state-of-the-art. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main thrust of our research consists of selective use of multiuser detection; self-organization; and adaptive routing. We consider multiuser detection techniques that exploit information available at the data link layer. Specifically, we are investigating the benefits of error detection side information in aiding interference cancellation and suppression. Research in self-organizing involves network connectivity optimization and allocation of resources. This optimization adapts network to topological changes on a relatively longer time scale. Network adaptation to physical and application layer attributes is primarily accomplished via adaptive routing. The investigators are evaluating the suitability of centralized and distributed, or perhaps hybrid, routing approaches. It is desired to provide rapid adaptation to changes in traffic and channel conditions, including interference, as well as changes in quality of service requirements.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This interdisciplinary research project is jointly funded in three NSF directorates: CISE/IIS, BIO/DBI and ENG/BES. The techniques developed in this research result in a new framework for the virtual discovery of new pharmaceuticals or materials. The basic idea is to utilize large existing pharmaceutical databases as input for a new type of structure/activity correlation methodology in order to calculate a large set of new and traditional descriptors to create improved Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models that characterize and predict important biological responses. Once the descriptors have been determined and a predictive model has been built, thousands of new potential molecules, chemically similar to those of the benchmark data set, are scanned from large databases and are evaluated for their chemical properties based on the predictive model. The aim is to target a few novel molecules with potentially attractive pharmaceutical properties that can then be tested further in the traditional way in the laboratory. Computationally intelligent data mining techniques are vital to extract the information necessary to select these novel molecules. This research applied novel machine learning paradigms such as semi-supervised learning with capacity control. These algorithms predict desired biological responses and generate QSAR models using both known (labeled) and unknown (unlabeled) biological responses. This project involves the development of an infrastructure of computationally intelligent computer codes that allow for the virtual design of novel pharmaceuticals or the improvement of existing pharmaceuticals. The proposed methodology is applicable to most pharmaceuticals for which a database of responses is available. The ultimate pay-off of this methodology is expected to lead to the rapid invention of new drugs for new or known society threatening diseases where a very fast response is warranted.</data>

(joint funding with CISE CNPq and International Program)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF-CNPq Collaborative Research: Multi-Agent Collaborative and Adversarial&lt;br/&gt; Perception, Planning, Execution, and Learning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a three-year standard award. This project aims to investigate a concrete spectrum of issues of relevance to the development of teams of complete robot agents in dynamic, real-time, and adversarial environments. The proposed research will investigate and develop agents that are: (1) autonomous - with on-board sensing, planning, and acting, (2) efficient - capable of achieving specific goals under time and resource constraints through the integration of deliberative and reactive planning, (3) cooperative - capable of collaborating with each other to accomplish tasks that are beyond individual&apos;s capabilities, and (4) adaptive - capable of learning from experience by refining their individual and collaborative action selection preferences.This multi-agent robotic research will be carried within the context of robotic soccer. The robotic soccer domain introduces many specific research topics, including: (i) complete integration of perception, action, and cognition in a team of multiple robotic agents; (ii) definition of a set of robust reactive planning behaviors for individual agents (each agent should be equipped with skills that enable it to effectively perform individual and collaborative actions); (iii) reliable, real-time and active visual perception, including tracking of multiple moving objects and prediction of object movement; (iv) multi-agent strategic reasoning. The proposed work will build upon the research experience of the&lt;br/&gt;U.S. research group on planning and learning and on the Brazilian research group on real-time perception.</data>

The PI&apos;s propose to design and develop a manipulation system that will be conceived from the start to satisfy the requirements and needs for operating in human environments. This human-centered manipulation system will be a two-arm structure connected to a common torso mounted on a mobile platform. Each arm will be a redundant mechanism with seven degrees of freedom. The arms will be lightweight structures, with low effective mass and inertia, and will use energy absorbing surfaces. The actuation of joints will be based on a novel and compact arrangement that uses three motors for two degrees of freedom joint mechanization. This yields a modular pitch-roll kinematics for the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints. The requirements for the integration of two arms with the self-contained platform is also an important aspect in this design. Reliability, low cost, clean and quite operations will also be among the characteristics addressed in this project.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Improving the Cost Effectiveness of WDM Optical Networks</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This proposal is a joint proposal submitted by investigators at the George Washington University and the College of William and Mary. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In spite of lower error rates and far higher capacities, WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) optical networks have yet to compete with their electronic counterparts in the marketplace. The main reason is the prohibitive cost of the hardware, which puts optical networks out of reach for all but a few users.&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed here takes aim at some of these prohibitive costs and is intended to help network designers answer some questions related to dimensioning and component-sizing that can help reduce hardware costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research takes as a starting point an all-optical circuit-switched multifiber avelength-routing ring, a tested technology, and asks the question ``Can high performance be obtained with less hardware?&apos;&apos; While many aspects of a network (ranging from manufacturability to higher-level software design) make up the overall cost, this project focuses on reducing costs by limiting the complexity (crosspoints) of optical switches and from more effectively using available bandwidth by time-slotting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three types of resource allocation problems that arise from these cost considerations will be investigated and algorithms that perform resource allocation will be designed and evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first type of problem involves limiting the flexibility of fiber-to-fiber switches in an effort to reduce the cost of manufacturing switches. Preliminary results indicate that near-optimal throughput can be obtained even with significant reduction in the connectivity of the switch. Some research questions that will be addressed in this case are: how does performance vary quantitatively with limitations in switching to fibers? does wavelength allocation differ fundamentally with these restrictions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second type of problem involves constructing larger networks from smaller rings. Research questions for this problem include: how should all-optical multiple rings be connected in a cost-effective manner, especially by using fiber-switching limitations? how should wavelengths be partitioned (if at all) for inter-ring and intra-ring sessions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third type of problem involves efficiently scheduling multi-rate sessions in an optical network with slots (time-division multiplexing). The practical feasibility of this technology has already been demonstrated. The focus here is on resource allocation problems that, by more effectively using bandwidth with fiber-switching limitations, reduce overall network cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, an integrative approach will be taken to study network performance when all three types of design features are present. The research results are intended to be applicable in the near future, and therefore the initial approach will use a combination of simulation and modeling, whereas later the PIs will aim for a deeper theoretical understanding of the problem.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Reliable multicast for Core-Based Multicast Routing</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Reliable multicast is an important and challenging problem which is yet to be solved in order to deploy multicast services on the Internet. In this proposal, the researchers propose to design, implement, and evaluate a reliable multicast scheme for core-based multicast routing, with the objectives of avoiding NAK implosion and duplicate replies, reducing recovery latency, achieving recovery isolation, and providing adaptivity to dynamic topology/membership changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most exsiting reliable multicast schemes focus on source-based multicast trees. They either cannot be directly deployed in core-based multicast trees or may render sub-optimal performance when directly deployed. The major difficulty lies in that an on-tree router on a core-based tree does not know, due to lack of the per-source information, how to direct a retransmission request toward the source or some designated replier router. The researchers propose to design a simple, yet effective scheme that facilitates routers on a core-based tree to properly direct retransmission requests so as to closely emulate the optimal recovery scenario achieved in the turning point approach. Specifically, the researchers consider the following&lt;br/&gt;research issues:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) To solve the problem of identifying upstream/downstream interfaces (with respect to a source), The researchers will (i) define a new path_info IP Option that carries the path information and have some of the data packets in a connection carry this IP Option. Each receiver that receives a data packet with this IP Option stores the path information for future use; and (ii) define a new TP_info IP Option to be carried in the retransmission requests so that a router knows how to direct retransmission requests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) To conduct local recovery in the case of membership and topology changes,the researchers will carefully devise a mechanism, with the use of on-line error statistics collection, soft state caching, and Bayesian analysis, for selecting designated hosts (called repliers) to which direct retransmission requests will be forwarded. A router now keeps track of error statistics over each of its interfaces and selects, with the use of&lt;br/&gt;Bayesian analysis, the most reliable links as replier links.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) As indicated in [levine:98], a pure NAK-based scheme requires an infinite buffer at the source for correct operation. The researchers will devise a delayed ACK approach so that both sources and repliers can purge data packets that have been received by all the group members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(4) For the proposed scheme to work in the existence of routers that do not have the reliable multicast capability, the researchers will devise a mechanism to detect clouds and to properly direct retransmission routers and reply messages through them, without loss of recovery isolation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is a combination of two synergistic components: development of all the component mechanisms in an analytic framework and their validation with software system building and experiments. We will pursue this research by taking advantage of the GateD Multicast source code (developed by the GateD Consortium, Merit Network, Inc.) as a software platform, and prototyping the proposed reliable multicast scheme (partially in the core-based multicast routing daemon and partially as the routing functions provided in the kernel). With the help of the Ohio Supercomputing Center (OSC) and OSU Medical Center, the researchers will use asdatabase/server centered on large amounts of patient images acquired from MR and CT as a representative multicast application to illustrate the key functional, reliable, scalable, and adaptive characteristics of the prototype software.</data>

New theories and architectures for&lt;br/&gt;development are being studied in fields related to both artificial and&lt;br/&gt;natural intelligence. Scaling up from ground, both in size and functionality,&lt;br/&gt;is required for dealing with real-world problems and for better&lt;br/&gt;understanding natural intelligence. How does an individual, biological or&lt;br/&gt;artificial, scale up its cognitive and behavioral capabilities through interactions &lt;br/&gt;with the environment? What are the common mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;that enable scaling up for a variety of cognitive and behavioral&lt;br/&gt;capabilities and their integration? Since this important subject is&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary, this workshop will bring together researchers from&lt;br/&gt;closely related fields, including artificial intelligence, machine learning,&lt;br/&gt;computer vision, pattern recognition, speech recognition, robotics,&lt;br/&gt;animal learning, developmental psychology, neuroscience and computational&lt;br/&gt;linguistics. The aim is to discuss (1) the role that development and&lt;br/&gt;learning can play in the development of artificial and natural intelligent&lt;br/&gt;agents, (2) the common principles that are shared by the development for&lt;br/&gt;very diverse cognitive and behavioral capabilities such as vision, speech,&lt;br/&gt;language, reasoning, planning, decision making, locomotion and&lt;br/&gt;object manipulation. (3) important directions for future research on&lt;br/&gt;development and learning, and (4) short-term and long-term applications.&lt;br/&gt;Findings of the workshop will be documented in a report which will be widely&lt;br/&gt;disseminated in the various related research communities. A website on&lt;br/&gt;development and learning will be created from this workshop as a long-term&lt;br/&gt;cross-disciplinary information center for those who are interested in&lt;br/&gt;artificial and natural intelligence.</data>

Although originally applied to hardware systems, finite-state verification (FSV) techniques (e.g. model checking) are emerging as the front-runner in the race to automate high-quality assurance of modern software. To apply FSV techniques, one must create a finite-state transition system model of the software system&apos;s behavior. The model and a property to be verified are given to a FSV tool, and verification is performed by mechanically enumerating all reachable states in the transition system and checking that the property holds at each state. Currently, finite-state models of software must be created by hand. Hand-coding complex language features such as parameterized generic modules, procedures, threads, and dynamically created program data and threads of control is tedious and error-prone, and will not scale to large production systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In other National Science Foundation supported work, techniques, methodologies, and tools are being developed for automatically constructing finite-state models of software using abstract interpretation and partial evaluation technology. The research associate is coordinating the development of a model construction tool suite for Java software. The associate is working closely with the PI and Co-PIs on both the theoretical and implementation aspects of the project and is responsible for supervising the implementation work of junior graduate students. These tasks provide an avenue for the associate&apos;s growth in performing and leading foundational and experimental research.</data>

It broadly examines exploiting prediction and speculation, heretofore limited to processor cores, in processors, memory, and the interactions between them. A driving focus of the work is multicast snooping, a new cache coherence approach that uses prediction to both increase effective bandwidth over a classical symmetric multiprocessor and reduce latency over a traditional directory-based system. Multicast snooping uses prediction to &quot;guess&quot; which processors have copies of a block and multicast address transactions&lt;br/&gt;to those processors. A novel network organization combines simultaneous multicasts to disjoint multicast sets while still providing ordering guarantees. A simplified directory verifies the prediction and takes&lt;br/&gt;corrective action when incorrect. Refining multicast snooping provides research challenges in areas such as hardware and software mask prediction, network implementation, forward progress, high availability, and a&lt;br/&gt;theoretical foundation for protocol and network behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The application of prediction and speculation to multiprocessor systems also exposes research opportunities applicable to multiprocessors more generally, including upgrade speculation, false sharing speculation, lock&lt;br/&gt;superposition, and speculation implementation issues. Hardware only, as well as hardware/software solutions strategies are being explored. The research plan encompasses design (refinement of existing ideas and development of new ones), evaluation (pruning the design space and comparing with existing alternatives), validation (ensuring designs work, including a new application of Lamport&apos;s logical clocks), demonstration (transferring technology to industry), and infrastructure development (tool adaptation and construction).</data>

      <data key="e_title">Traffic Control for Networks with Aggregate Quality-of-Service</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">As the Internet continues to expand into new application domains, there is a growing demand for differentiated services that provide varying degrees of Quality of Service (QoS). Until recently, the approach for service differentiation in the Internet has focused on providing QoS guarantees to individual traffic flows. This per-flow model has not been widely embraced, largely due to the vast amount of state information that needs to be maintained in the network. As a consequence, the network community is currently redefining the notion &lt;br/&gt;of QoS for the Internet, leading to a new service model where guarantees are made to appropriate flows, rather than to individual flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The notions of aggregate QoS which are being defined, e.g., by the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) working group in the IETF, are very different from traditional networking concepts and require novel &lt;br/&gt;algorithms for traffic control and provisioning. The objective of the proposed research is to give fundamental insights into the nature and delivery of QoS to traffic aggregates, henceforth called aggregate QoS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central feature of service models for aggregate QoS is that there is no requirement for users to specify the composition or the destination of traffic. This significantly complicates the provisioning of network resources and suggests that new, feedback-intensive traffic control algorithms must be developed to &lt;br/&gt;mitigate uncertainty about network loading. At present there is little or no theory available to guide the development of such algorithms. The proposed research will remedy this situation by developing analytical tools that will make aggregate QoS possible for the next-generation Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three main research components of this proposal involve development of analysis techniques and computational simulation experimentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The projectl proposes to develop a novel fluid-flow, network-optimization model that will facilitate (a) rapid analysis of aggregate QoS networks and (b) improved routing, based on feedback about network &lt;br/&gt;traffic patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Using a new construct of so-called effective envelopes, the project will develop a method for computing the statistical multiplexing gain in a network with aggregate QoS. Knowledge of the statistical multiplexing gain is essential for determining the amount of traffic with aggregate QoS that can be supported in a network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. The project will build a packet-level simulation environment, which will enable the development and testing of a wide variety of traffic control algorithms for aggregate QoS networks. This research will &lt;br/&gt;help to identify metrics for comparing the effect of traffic control algorithms to support aggregate QoS. An important part of our work is to determine the extent to which feedback-base traffic control can &lt;br/&gt;alleviate the provisioning problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By providing a theoretical reference frame for aggregate QoS, which provides tools and techniques for capacity provisioning and admission control, the proposed research will complement the currently ongoing &lt;br/&gt;standardization efforts for differentiated services on the Internet.</data>

One portion&lt;br/&gt;of this process is to ensure that the compiler produces machine code&lt;br/&gt;that accurately represents the algorithms specified at the source code&lt;br/&gt;level. This is a formidable task since an optimizing compiler not only&lt;br/&gt;translates the source code to machine code, it may apply hundreds or&lt;br/&gt;thousands of code improving transformations to even a relatively small&lt;br/&gt;program. This project will use two approaches that dramatically simplify&lt;br/&gt;the validation of code improving transformations. First, the equivalence&lt;br/&gt;of the program representation before and after each improving&lt;br/&gt;transformation will be checked, rather than attempting to equate the&lt;br/&gt;source and object programs directly. Each individual code improving&lt;br/&gt;transformation typically consists of only a few changes. Second, only&lt;br/&gt;the region of the program that has changed, as opposed to the entire&lt;br/&gt;program representation, will be checked. The regions of the program&lt;br/&gt;representation that are changed by an improving transformation are&lt;br/&gt;typically quite small. The equivalence will be shown by demonstrating&lt;br/&gt;that the effects of the region on the rest of the program will remain the&lt;br/&gt;same before and after the improving transformation.

      <data key="e_abstract">Proposal Number: CCR-9974980&lt;br/&gt;Title: Improving Hugs: Haskell as a Research Tool&lt;br/&gt;PI&apos;s: Tim Sheard and Mark Jones, Oregon Graduate Institute&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The programming language Haskell has emerged as the standard lazy&lt;br/&gt;functional language, and offers strong typing, higher-order features, and&lt;br/&gt;parametric polymorphism. The Hugs interpreter is a simple, easily ported,&lt;br/&gt;implementation of Haskell. This project will enhance Hugs, focusing on&lt;br/&gt;issues of usability and integration with the high-performance Glasgow&lt;br/&gt;Haskell Compiler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project improves the Hugs interpreter in several ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integration with GHC runtime system:&lt;br/&gt;By completing the integration of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler run-time&lt;br/&gt;system with the Hugs interpreter, a fully interoperable system capable&lt;br/&gt;of executing a mixture of compiled and byte-code interpreted code will&lt;br/&gt;be constucted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Declarative debugging: &lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate the problem of tracing the computational steps&lt;br/&gt;of a lazy functional program, at a level of abstraction consistent with the&lt;br/&gt;programmers view of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Better Error Reporting:&lt;br/&gt;The project investigates how to improve the type error debugging&lt;br/&gt;process by building improved type inference systems into&lt;br/&gt;Hugs, capable of reporting both where and why type errors have&lt;br/&gt;occurred.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful integration with the GHC run-time system has numerous&lt;br/&gt;benefits. It allows the Hugs interpreter to access the existing GHC&lt;br/&gt;features including compiled preludes and libraries, while maintaining&lt;br/&gt;the small footprint and ease of use of an interpreter. Completion of&lt;br/&gt;the project will greatly increase the size and complexity of the&lt;br/&gt;problems to which the Hugs interpreter can be applied.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">With National Science Foundation support Dr David Cooper and his colleagues will develop a technology for the recovery of 3D free-form object and selected scene structure from one or more images and video. The technique is based on the development of 3D shape representation and a semi-interactive, mixed-initiative system, along with machine decision-directed Bayesian surface-estimation. The main focus of the effort is the development of tools useful in archaeological site and artifact reconstruction and architecture. This will impact low level shape models and how they are assembled to form either more complex objects or complete ones. The latter condition often occurs at archaeological excavation sites where objects are found in pieces, or have been damaged from erosion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite recent substantial progress in automated scene recovery in computer vision, the challenges presented by free-form shape extraction and assembly are still great. The researchers will employ an interactive approach in which a user can guide the recovery process or can be available when requested for assistance by the machine, e.g., in the complex task of assembling many fragments to re-create a large or complicated object. The intent is to develop the fundamentals of a user-controlled technology for the benefit of the naive user. The ultimate goal is to enhance productivity in interacting with large amounts of complex visual data by modeling the underlying 3D structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide new practical tools. It will also provide an effective testbed for 3D shape reconstruction and recognition, more descriptive local and global models for working with 3D shapes, a better understanding of human/decision-making-machine interaction for free-form geometric modeling and for extracting 3D geometry from one or more images and video, and associated computational complexity issues. As applied to the field of archaeology, this technology will provide improved surveying methods, an advanced archaeological record and a means to conduct high-level analysis not heretofore available. It will further permit the transfer of reconstruction capabilities from the artist directly to the archaeologist.

      <data key="e_title">KDI: 3D Free-Form Models for Geometric Recovery and Applications to Archaeology</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">With National Science Foundation support Dr David Cooper and his colleagues will develop a technology for the recovery of 3D free-form object and selected scene structure from one or more images and video. The technique is based on the development of 3D shape representation and a semi-interactive, mixed-initiative system, along with machine decision-directed Bayesian surface-estimation. The main focus of the effort is the development of tools useful in archaeological site and artifact reconstruction and architecture. This will impact low level shape models and how they are assembled to form either more complex objects or complete ones. The latter condition often occurs at archaeological excavation sites where objects are found in pieces, or have been damaged from erosion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite recent substantial progress in automated scene recovery in computer vision, the challenges presented by free-form shape extraction and assembly are still great. The researchers will employ an interactive approach in which a user can guide the recovery process or can be available when requested for assistance by the machine, e.g., in the complex task of assembling many fragments to re-create a large or complicated object. The intent is to develop the fundamentals of a user-controlled technology for the benefit of the naive user. The ultimate goal is to enhance productivity in interacting with large amounts of complex visual data by modeling the underlying 3D structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide new practical tools.

As applied to the field of archaeology, this technology will provide improved surveying methods, an advanced archaeological record and a means to conduct high-level analysis not heretofore available. It will further permit the transfer of reconstruction capabilities from the artist directly to the archaeologist.

Distance education is often not readily available to those who could benefit from it most (such as those in developing countries and rural areas in the United States). This conference/workshop will bring together decision-makers from under-served countries and leaders in distance learning and telemedicine to discuss practical solutions for implementing affordable global electronic distance learning across national boundaries. The goals of the workshop are to promote affordable distance education, increase cross-cultural understanding, promote sustainability, identify pilot cooperative research projects, and discuss standardization and curriculum development.</data>

(1/3 of funding is from ECS division of Engineering Directorate)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Study of Quadruped Gallops by Simulation and Experimentation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed project includes simulation, design, construction and testing&lt;br/&gt;of a legged robot in gallop gaits. The project will test theoretical&lt;br/&gt;models of the mechanics and control of galloping developed by the&lt;br/&gt;authors and others. The project will break new ground by being the&lt;br/&gt;first attempt to operate an artificial machine in a true gallop. Other&lt;br/&gt;new departures will be numerical and experimental investigation of&lt;br/&gt;strategies for rapid starts and stops, and for sudden changes in&lt;br/&gt;direction. A gallop is more complex than the symmetric gaits used in&lt;br/&gt;previous running quadrupedal robot studies because it is a single-foot&lt;br/&gt;gait with the feet touching down individually, and because it is&lt;br/&gt;obviously asymmetric. The asymmetry results from the non-linear&lt;br/&gt;interaction of the ballistic trajectories of the body between footfalls&lt;br/&gt;and the pitch and roll movements of the body resulting from off-axis&lt;br/&gt;foot thrusts. Control and stabilization of galloping will be&lt;br/&gt;extensively studied in numerical simulation before implementation in&lt;br/&gt;hardware. The same approach of simulation followed by experimental&lt;br/&gt;testing will be used to study strategies for rapid starts, stops and&lt;br/&gt;changes of direction.</data>

      <data key="e_title">A Quasi-Static Optoelectronic ATM Switch</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The virtually unlimited bandwidth of optical fibers has caused tremendous increase in data transmission speed during the past decade, thereby stimulating high demanding Gb/s multimedia services such as distance learning and video conferencing. ATM has been accepted by ITU-T as a promising and efficient technique of transporting Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (BISDN) applications. The new challenge lies in the deployment of Tb/s multicast ATM switches tomeet the exponential growth of multimedia and internet traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the concept of the researcher&apos;s path switching, they propose a Tb/smulticast ATM switch architecture that interconnects electronic switch modules with a quasi-static controlled optical interconnection network (OIN). Routing in the OIN is predetermined to avoid slot-by-slot processing and to provide flexible switching capacity on virtual pathlevel. The surrounding electronic switch modules support multicasting, fast dynamic routing and statistical multiplexing to compensate the the quasi-static routing in the OIN to achieve totally a Tb/s switching capacity. This quasi-static switching architecture simplifies the design of a Tb/s ATM switch to specially featured Gb/s switch modules: the electronic multicast input and output modules and optical central interconnection, which are all feasible with existing technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The future research plan includes three aspects. First, the researchers will develop an updating mechanism for readjusting the middle-stage route pattern to adapt the traffic change. The tradeoff between time complexity and performance will be investigated. Secondly, they will identify the requirement of the optical devices to effectively control the crosstalk and the power budget based on our proposed OIN. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, they will investigate several approaches of performing output contention resolution within multicast electronic switch modules: work out a cost-effective design for each approach, study the performance in terms of throughput, cell delay and loss rate, and finally identify the best approach that has high performance and reasonable construction complexity.</data>

This robot allows a researcher to directly access and modify the sinusolidally commutated current amplifiers; hence, its open control architecture facilitates the design and development of advanced low-level position/force controllers for multiple degree of freedom robotic systems. More importantly, the multiple degrees of freedom and the end-effector mounted hand allow one to focus on specific dexterous manipulation problems.

The PI&apos;s will perform research addressing capture, interpretation, access and delivery of multiple media streams. At the application level, research will address deducing users expressions (e.g. focus of interest) and emotions; scaling issues to the campus wide level will be explored for the virtual classroom, and the equipment will support a research on perceptual processing. Systems level research will examine QoS methods, shared state, metadata, and storage architecture for multimedia lectures and other objects. Middleware and runtime systems will be developed for inter-cluster and client server computing as well as to handle media streams in a heterogeneous environment.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CTS-9904327 ZVI RUSAK &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this effort is the development of an experimentally verified model for the dynamics of combustion states with swirling flows and to provide an understanding of the physical mechanisms leading to instabilities in lean, premixed combustion systems. Analyses combine classical asymptotic approaches with modern tools from functional analysis, dynamical system theory, and the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations. Emphasis is on combustion and flow conditions for which bifurcations may occur and where small- or large-amplitude instabilities may evolve. Boundary conditions are taken from experimental observations. Extensive numerical computations are conducted, in particular of the far-from bifurcation behavior of the system. Theoretical and numerical results are compared with data from Louisiana State University for model and code validation, and from prediction of instabilities or transients that affect the combustion process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instabilities that develop in lean, premixed combustion systems with swirl present severe design limitations in modern, low-emission systems, especially when vortex breakdown is exploited to stabilize the flame and enhance combustion efficiency.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">This project explores how a cognitive-representational approach to early reading can lead to new and efficient instruction that will impact learning across the curriculum. The research questions addressed are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Which design principles are most important for a balanced approach to literacy instruction that uses multimedia environments for integrated, efficient instruction of decoding and word recognition skills?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will design principles suggested by research help teachers better understand and integrate decoding skills into their classroom literacy environments?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can a combination of video and print materials linked to multimedia environments be effective tools for improving children&apos;s home environments and parental support for early reading instruction?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate these questions by developing an understanding of design principles for children&apos;s word recognition fluency and decoding skills using current cognitive theories of mental representations of language. Within-subject designs will be used to see how different variations of prototype software affect children&apos;s word recognition fluency and decoding skills. These initial studies will also include between-subject controls that use no software. At-home reading of both decodable text and rich, high-quality children&apos;s literature will be linked to the content and structure of the decoding and word recognition software. This at-home reading will be supported by video exemplars. The children with at-home access to these materials and the software in school will be compared with those children with just the software at school. Additionally, software based on recent cognitive theories will be compared to commercially available software designed to aid children in developing decoding skills by comparing the reading development of children using research software vs. commercially available software.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">99-01321&lt;br/&gt;Siewiorek, Daniel&lt;br/&gt;Koopman, Philip&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CISE Experimental Partnerships: Processing/Communication/Interface&lt;br/&gt;Tradeoffs to Optimize Energy Locality in Mobile Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As computers continue to shrink, research and commercial interest in mobile/wearable computing is rapidly growing. Unlike traditional desktop computing in which the user is required to come to the computer, mobile computing brings the computer to the user. One of the key problems with mobile/wearable computing is energy consumption. Battery weight for mobile/wearable computers often exceeds the weight of all other components combined. In order to make mobile/wearable computing widely applicable, major advances in reducing power consumption and battery weight are needed. In this research a testbed, Infocator, is being developed to study energy issues in mobile/wearable computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mobile/wearable systems are typically comprised of both computing and communications systems. While power consumption required by the computing component is rapidly decreasing, power consumption required by the communications component is not keeping pace. It is estimated that by the year 2001, nearly 80% of the power consumed by mobile/wearable will be due to communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trading off energy-expensive communication for energy cheap computation through effective partitioning of control and data can result in significant energy savings. Methods for determining the ideal control/data&lt;br/&gt;partitioning are being developed and codified in a Theory of Energy Locality. To realize the partitioning and facilitate control movement, a generic application independent framework for proxies is also being&lt;br/&gt;developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To maximize the effectiveness of wearable systems in mobile computing environments, the interface design ust be carefully matched with user tasks and balanced against energy consumption. Many complex and interrelated issues determine the balance between ease-of-use and power consumption. Simply trading off ase-of-use for lower per operation power consumption may result in higher task energy consumption due to the increase in the number of operations needed to traverse a less intuitive interface. The effect of user interface on energy consumption is also being evaluated by developing several different interfaces for nfocator and measuring and comparing the ease-of-use and energy consumption.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Multiprocessor interconnects have been designed primarily to provide high&lt;br/&gt;throughput and low latency for best-effort traffic. This is true for&lt;br/&gt;processing node architectures and communication software as well. However,&lt;br/&gt;with the increasing use of these systems (clusters in particular) for&lt;br/&gt;interactive applications such as multimedia, web servers and electronic&lt;br/&gt;commerce, predictable communication performance, called Quality of service&lt;br/&gt;(QoS), has become a major concern. Many of these applications require&lt;br/&gt;guaranteed communication delay and bandwidth, in addition to low latency&lt;br/&gt;and high throughput. The main focus of this research is to design an&lt;br/&gt;end-to-end communication infrastructure for a cluster system to support&lt;br/&gt;different applications with varying QoS requirements. The research&lt;br/&gt;activities include (1) router architecture design and evaluation to provide&lt;br/&gt;predictable and high performance; (2) network interface and software&lt;br/&gt;messaging layer support to inject/eject traffic into/from the network as&lt;br/&gt;per QoS requirements; and (3) CPU scheduling mechanisms that propagate&lt;br/&gt;these capabilities up to the application level. The research proposes to&lt;br/&gt;seamlessly integrate these three components to provide a high performance&lt;br/&gt;communication architecture with QoS guarantees.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Structure Preserving Reduced Rank Approximation: Theory, Algorithms and Software</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Determining a structure preserving reduced rank approximation to a given structured matrix has many important applications such as signal processing, image processing, system identification, and control &lt;br/&gt;processes. The goal of this project is to develop the mathematical foundation, and design fast and robust algorithms for computing this structured reduced rank approximation, and making the resulting software available for use in the application areas. In this research, all linear and nonlinear structures of &lt;br/&gt;matrices will be considered, where the matrices can be represented as a differentiable function of a parameter vector, which includes sparse, symmetric, banded with fixed bandwidth, Hankel, Toeplitz, Vandermonde, or combinations of these. In addition, the project will investigate a broad range of applications for which new techniques will prove effective, and for which the accuracy of solutions can be improved dramatically with the exploitation of both rank deficiency and problem structure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic approach used is the minimization of the norm of an appropriate error, while preserving the structure and specified lower rank of the approximating matrix. This is a difficult problem, both theoretically and computationally, because the structure preservation and rank reduction requirements make this a nonconvex minimization problem, which may have more than one local minimum. To overcome this difficulty, several techniques will be attempted, including the way in which the reduced rank condition is formulated, and the selection of good initial values. This approach leads to a structure preserving overdetermined system of equations, which can be solved by the Structured Total Least Norm (STLN) algorithm, developed previously by the principal investigator.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Proxy Services in Wide Area Networks</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Interest in streaming media services has grown dramatically in recent years due to the unparalleled popularity of the Internet and the increase in backbone and access bandwidth. As client access bandwidth further increases, the demand for high-quality audio/video streaming will grow. Emerging applications include orchestrated media applications, such as distance learning, that combine audio, video, images, and text from one or more sources. Other challenging multimedia applications are on the horizon, including virtual reality and distributed interactive simulation. These applications involve both constant-bit-rate and variable-bit-rate streams of varying popularity, and different degrees of support for user interactivity, such as VCR or branching operations.&lt;br/&gt; These emerging high-quality multimedia applications will pose serious challenges to the network infras-tructure. A common thread among these applications is the so-called &quot;continuous&quot; nature of their data. In continuous media (CM), strict timing relationships exist that define the schedule by which CM data must be rendered (e.g., a video displayed or audio played out). In a network setting, the playout timing constraints, the rate variability of specific CM such as variable bit rate (VBR) video, the possibility of packet loss and delay within the network, and the desire to use network resources efficiently combine to make the delivery of CM data an exceptionally challenging problem. The challenge of delivering high-quality audio and video is further complicated by the fact that a single network service provider typically does not control the entire path from the source to the end client(s). One promising approach to addressing these challenges is to deploy proxy services within the network. Proxies can hide heterogeneity, reduce user start-up latency, lower the network resource usage, and adapt to fluctuations in network performance properties.&lt;br/&gt; In this proposal, the project director outlines research whose goal is to develop and evaluate proxy services that improves the perceived quality of CM streams seen by clients while providing low startup latencies. The project will focus on the development of the services themselves, the underlying resource management mechanisms required at the proxy, the programming interface required so that these services access the resource management mechanisms, and characterizations of the workloads and access patterns typically encountered by such proxies. The approach to evaluating these services and mechanisms is eclectic, relying on a combination of analysis, simulation, and experimentation with a Linux-based proxy, PRONTO, which will be further enhanced throughout the project.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Deriving and Analyzing Learning Algorithms</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">It can be difficult to tell which learning algorithm is best for a particular situation. The bias of many on-line learning algorithms can be encoded with a &quot;distance function&quot; on the hypothesis space, and (for simple problems) an amortized analysis can be used to provide relative performance guarantees (analogous to the competitive ratios for k-server problems). These guarantees can be used to indicate when one bias is more appropriate than another, allowing an intelligent choice of learning algorithm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the connection between the distance functions over hypotheses and the Bregman divergences used in convex optimization. By adapting the tools developed for Bregman divergences, the investigators will improve and generalize the performance guarantees. This will result in more accurate predictions of how well the various learning algorithms will perform on a wider variety of problems. Furthermore, the improved understanding will enable the derivation of new learning algorithms tailored to specific situations.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">As the amount of data processed by a computer system increases, new, more complex and flexible algorithms and data representations are required. At the same time, new visualization and interaction techniques are required to help the user access, understand, and manipulate the data. The ability to steer a computation and modify the models during the course of a simulation is required in order to use those simulations as an exploration tool. All this means that traditionally separate tasks, including model construction, numerical simulation and visualization, should be tightly integrated. There is a need for new data representations that are scalable, robust, and adaptive to accommodating a variety of computational and visualization algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore combined representations of 2D and 3D geometry. The immediate goal is to find adequate representations for computationally challenging fluid flow simulations with dynamic boundaries. These representations will enable hierarchical solvers to compute successive approximations to the flow, interactive visualization of the 3D fluid, and interactive steering of the computational parameters (e.g. precision) and physical parameters (e.g. boundary conditions) of the simulations. The project will test the viability of these representations in an interactive system for fluid flow simulations.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Dynamic Resource Allocation for Wireless Multimedia DS-CDMA</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">This research is concerned with techniques for supporting integrated services over a wireless cellular network. A fundamental problem is how to allocate radio resources to different users to optimize an overall network objective criterion while satisfying Quality of Service constraints. Wireless networks based on Direct-Sequence (DS)-Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA) networks are considered, since DS-CDMA is a strong contender for next generation cellular systems. Radio ``resources&apos;&apos; in a DS-CDMA network include transmitted powers, processing gains, and number of assigned codes. The focus of this research is on Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) in the presence of time-varying user requests. The goals are to (1) Develop techniques for DRA given multiple traffic flows with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, and (2) Characterize performance/complexity tradeoffs associated with&lt;br/&gt;these techniques given simple traffic and propagation models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators consider a series of problems and approaches for DRA in a CDMA network based on progressive refinements of the system model. First, they consider a single class of data traffic flows within an isolated cell. Reliability is assumed to be guaranteed through retransmissions, and DRA is studied&lt;br/&gt;in the presence of time-selective fading. Two traffic flows, representative of voice and data, are then introduced (in the absence of fading), and the relationship between reassignment of resources and admission control is studied. DRA in a multi-cell system is also considered taking into account measurement-based power constraints which limit interference to other cells. Finally, pricing is investigated as a method for DRA which accounts for user utilities. Methods for dynamic pricing are studied in the context of the models previously described.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIS-9911161&lt;br/&gt;Camps, Octavia&lt;br/&gt;Pennsylvania State University&lt;br/&gt;75,000 - 12 mos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SGER: Robust Multi-objective Active Vision Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a SGER standard award. Recent hardware advances have rendered active vision a viable option for a very diverse spectrum of applications ranging from MEMS &lt;br/&gt;manufacture to vision assisted surgery. However, in order for active &lt;br/&gt;vision to gain widespread application, the problem of fragility (i.e. &lt;br/&gt;lack of robustness) of systems designed using classical approaches&lt;br/&gt;must be addressed. This project aims to explore the feasibility of solving this &lt;br/&gt;difficulty through a multidisciplinary approach, which brings to bear on &lt;br/&gt;the problem new multi-objective robust control and robust vision tools &lt;br/&gt;that are just starting to emerge in the respective communities. Specifically, &lt;br/&gt;The PIs will use robust feature modeling and identification techniques to &lt;br/&gt;recast the problem into a multi-objective control form that can be exactly &lt;br/&gt;solved using convex optimization techniques. If successful, this effort &lt;br/&gt;will result in an expanded robust active vision framework, capable of &lt;br/&gt;addressing multiple performance specifications and uncertainty. The results &lt;br/&gt;obtained from this research are expected to show that a tight integration of &lt;br/&gt;the control and vision aspects of the problem in a unified framework leads &lt;br/&gt;to substantial improvements both in performance and flexibility.</data>

The Parallel Computing Center will significantly improve the quality and expand the scope of scientific research in two key ways: 1. For the large scale computational projects currently carried out using the National Supercomputing Centers, it will facilitate code development, preliminary runs for parameter searchers, data analysis and visualization. 2. The center will support development and expansion of projects beyond the workstation scale which are presently below the National Supercomputing Center scale. In summary, the existing computational research program will be enhanced and new projects will be fostered.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Multiresolution Visualization Tools for Interactive Analysis of Large-Scale N-Dimensional Datasets</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Advances in computing technology are making simulation as important to science today as theory and experiment have been in the past. Unfortunately this success is overwhelming the scientific community by drowning scientists in the data produced. Because of storage, network, and graphics bottlenecks, more data is produced than can be analyzed or visualized. Valuable information is being lost or neglected because of these deficiencies. Additionally, scientists are painfully aware of this technological bottleneck, and it affects how they conduct their science. It slows the rate of data acquisition, and calculations that could generate higher-dimensional data, e.g. vector and tensor, are not being performed. The goal of this project is to address the visualization bottleneck by developing multiresolution software tools that will facilitate understanding of large-scale experimental and simulation datasets. The project will then apply these new techniques to data from physics and biology, thus providing advances in fluid dynamics and neuroscience. We will do this by close interactions with the discipline scientists, including using their feedback to improve initial designs of our tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical approach of the project is based on the fact that the graphics workstations available to most scientists are incapable of visualizing giga- and tera-scale datasets. It is also clear that for the foreseeable future our ability to generate data will outpace our ability to render and visualize it. Therefore we must develop methods for representing, segmenting and compressing these enormous datasets into a form that can be processed on today&apos;s graphics computers. Multiresolution representations and algorithms are at the core of the methods and tools to be developed. A multiresolution approach allows visualization techniques to scale to enormous datasets by focusing resources in those regions of the dataset most important to the user. For example, multiresolution modeling and display techniques will allow a user to view a single dataset at a coarse level-of--detail, and easily provide pertinent details only in those regions of greatest interest. During analysis, multiresolution methods can allocate more computational resources in segments of the data with the greatest rates of change or containing specific properties. This project will produce a set of multiresolution software tools for processing and visualizing large-scale N-dimensional (scalar, vector and tensor) volumetric datasets (NDVDs), as well as large-scale triangle meshes. Specifically, tools for segmenting and interpolating NDVDs using level-set methods, extracting semi-regular meshes directly from volume datasets, compressing triangle meshes, and volume rendering NDVDs will be developed. As tools become available they will be deployed to scientists at Caltech&apos;s Center for Simulation of Dynamic Response of Materials (sponsored by DOE), and to scientists at the National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research (UC San Diego).</data>

      <data key="e_title">Impacts of E-Commerce on Firm and Industry Organization</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The rapid growth of e-commerce on the Internet has raised a question of whether the Internet will mainly facilitate market consolidation by large companies, or whether it will be a driver of growth for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well. This is significant because e-commerce could lead to increased competition, greater consumer choice and more innovation, or it could lead to reduced competition, consumer choice and innovation, depending on the impacts of e-commerce on firm and industry organization. The early evidence on the question is mixed and largely anecdotal. Therefore, the objective of this research to provide scientific evidence on the question. It uses theory on firm and industry organization as the conceptual basis for hypothesizing that e-commerce will lead to greater use of market transactions, as opposed to internal hierarchies, to organize economic activities, leading to increased competition and new business opportunities. This project examines the hypothesis through systematic, detailed case studies of the extended value chains of four firms in the PC industry. The computer industry is chosen because it is the leading user of e-commerce and it includes manufacturing, service, and information sectors, thus providing a microcosm of the national economy. The results will not only contribute new knowledge, but also provide a scientific basis for public discussion about the social and economic impacts of e-commerce, and lead to a more extended empirical study.</data>

(Totally funded by the Division of Undergraduate Education in the amount of $165,244)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DLI-Phase 2: Research on a Digital Library for Graphics and Visualization Education &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award. This project focuses on two areas of interest to the development of a national digital library: testbeds and applications for undergraduate education and human-centered and collections-based research. The three goals of the project are 1) to provide a model for the reuse and repurposing of materials in a digital library based upon the Xtensible Markup Language (XML); 2) the improvement of navigation capabilities using information visualization techniques based upon XML and 3D Web graphics; and 3) the creation and development of a collaborative user community. The project uses standard Web-based technologies and is platform independent. It is part of the consortium lead by the COLLEGIS Research Institute (CRI) to develop a federated set of collections with a primary emphasis on education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds upon past ACM Special Interest Group in Graphics (SIGGRAPH) - NSF cooperative efforts, current ACM SIGGRAPH Education Committee projects, and the industry effort to create tools for XML and related applications. It will be a joint effort between ACM SIGGRAPH Education Committee (SEC) and the Hypermedia and Visualization Laboratory (HVL) at Georgia State University (GSU). It focuses on the SEC Digital Library (SECDL) and its community of users. The SECDL contains a large number of peer reviewed multimedia materials and is rapidly growing in size. It is a stable resource fully supported by SEC. Using emerging technologies such as XML, this project enables SEC to realize its vision of a hypermedia learning environment that can be used by the community of students and educators from all disciplines interested in computer graphics and visualization.</data>

      <data key="e_title">A Verification Manager for Adaptive Model Checking</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">With verification taking about two thirds of the development cycle, formal&lt;br/&gt;methods hold great promise of increasing the productivity of electronic&lt;br/&gt;designers. To overcome the limitations of current formal verification&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, this project explores adaptive model checking techniques. Model&lt;br/&gt;checking is a technique for the verification of properties of finite state&lt;br/&gt;systems. Application of model checking to large systems is hindered by the&lt;br/&gt;exponential growth of the number of states with the number of state&lt;br/&gt;variables---a problem known as state explosion. This project addresses the&lt;br/&gt;state explosion problem by a combination of three approaches: verification&lt;br/&gt;management, automatic abstraction/refinement, and binary decision diagram&lt;br/&gt;(BDD) technology. These approaches combine to give adaptive model checking,&lt;br/&gt;in which the verification management component identifies the appropriate&lt;br/&gt;partitioning and abstraction strategies and extracts from the design to be&lt;br/&gt;verified information that guides BDD-based algorithms to efficient symbolic&lt;br/&gt;state exploration.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Dynamic Adaptive Wireless Networks with Autonomous Robot Nodes</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">The Multihop wireless capabilities will enable communication and coordination among autonomous nodes in unplanned environments and configurations. At the same time wireless channels present challenges of dynamic operating conditions, power constraints for autonomously-powered nodes, and complicating interactions between high level behavior and lower level channel characteristics (e.g. , increased synchronized communication will significantly degrade channel characteristics). The major goal of the research is the development, testing and characterization of algorithms for scalable, application driven, wireless network services using a heterogeneous collection of communicating mobile nodes. Some of these nodes will be autonomous (robots) in that their movements will not be human controlled. The others will be portable thus, making them dependent on humans for transportation. While the focus of the work is on the mobile nodes, include immobile computers on the network as well. It emphasize that most (though not all)&lt;br/&gt;of the mobile nodes will have modest sensing, computational and communication resources. The collection as a whole is an example of a sensor network. The chief scientific motivation behind the work is the design of robust, efficient and scalable algorithms. The researchers hypothesize that distributed algorithms that rely on local interactions have many compelling characteristics, resulting in these properties. There is significant overlap between the problems of coordinating the autonomous mobile nodes that carry some of the sensors and the algorithms that direct the f ow of information from source(s) to sink(s) in the network. Both setsof algorithms will be carefully designed to improve robustness, effciency and scalability.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIS-9978138&lt;br/&gt;Canny, John&lt;br/&gt;University of California - Berkeley &lt;br/&gt;$116,863 - 12 mos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PRoPs and Gesturing Avatars: Embodied Robotic Interfaces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award. With the spread of personal computers and ubiquitous networking, computing has become a consumer technology. This growth was fed by demand for a new kind of computing: computers as *communication and information management tools*. But for a variety of reasons, no&lt;br/&gt;current technology is a reasonable substitute for face-to-face communication. The ultimate computer-mediated communication form is telepresence via a robotic proxy. Many aspects of communication are possible only with this medium, and a precise characterization of those capabilities is the subject of this project. The project relies&lt;br/&gt;heavily on concepts from the disciplines of inter-personal psychology and non-verbal communication. The former discipline deals with people&apos;s perception of a communication experience, how accurately they perceived the other person&apos;s intention, disposition, and&lt;br/&gt;emotions. Non-verbal communication studies the role of particular cues, like gaze, gesture and posture, in contributing to a communication experience. In this research, telerobots are called &quot;PRoPs&apos;&apos; for Personal Roving Presence. The name emphasizes the&lt;br/&gt;personal connection between the pilot and the robot, and that the robot is not an autonomous agent, but a manifestation (a presence) of its pilot. The project focuses on telepresence in the workplace, and within that category, on informational (office) workplaces and laboratories (which involve more interaction with objects). The main&lt;br/&gt;research issues to be explored are: (i) generating and controlling non-verbal communication cues, especially spatialized ones such as gaze and gesturing (ii) easy and intuitive navigation and (iii) affective haptics. The social contexts to be explored are (i)&lt;br/&gt;communication (ii) persuasion and (iii) trust-building.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">EIA-9974976&lt;br/&gt;Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;Eigenmann, Rudolf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compiling for Speculative Distributed Microarchitectures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project introduces a novel compiler paradigm called conservative-assumption-free compilation, which breaks the barrier of a conservative compile-time assumption, one of the most severe limitations of current generation of compilers. The new paradigm is enabled by emerging speculative, distributed microarchitechtures. In the proposed project the PIs will implement a full compiler system for such architectures. The effort will complement the already-onging Purdue Multiplex architecture project being investigated by the same PIs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purdue Multiplex combines trends of increasing on-chip integration with aggressive speculative instruction execution. Its distributed, single-chip microarchitecture integrates conventional multiprocessor thread-level parallelism with speculative execution of today&apos;s aggressive superscalar processors. The compiler generates threads, which are not necessarily independent, from a sequential program and the hardware guarantees correctness in case of inter-thread control/data dependencies via speculation and rollback mechanisms. By providing support for thread-level speculation, the hardware relieves the compiler of the burden of guaranteeing inter-thread independence, enabling our conservative-assumption-free compilation paradigm. Our compiler will speculatively parallelize the unexplored domain of non-numeric applications via new analyses and novel transformations. Our compiler will tightly integrate techniques to exploit both instruction-level and thread-level parallelism.</data>

This idea for an integrated computation and information resource called the Computational Power Grid has been described by the recent book entitled The Grid: Blueprint for a New Computing Infrastructure [40]. The Grid will connect the nation&apos;s computers, databases, instruments, and people in a seamless web, supporting emerging computation-rich application concepts such as remote computing, distributed supercomputing, tele-immersion, smart instruments, and data-mining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To realize this vision, significant scientific and technical obstacles must be overcome. Principal among these is usability. Because the Grid will be inherently more complex than existing computer systems, programs that execute on the Grid will reflect some of this complexity. The Grid resources will be useful and accessible to scientist and engineers requiring new software tools that embody major advances in both the theory and practice of building Grid applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Grid Application Development Software (GrADS) Project is to simply distribute heterogeneous computing in the same way that the World Wide Web simplified information sharing over the Internet.

      <data key="e_abstract">EIA-9975018&lt;br/&gt;Rauchwerger, Lawrence&lt;br/&gt;CISE Next Generation Software(NG)&lt;br/&gt;Texas Engineering Experimental Station&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SmartApps: Smart Applications for Heterogeneous Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal proposes to generate SMART APPLICATION code that uses information about its input data, operating system services and architecture capability, to adaptively reconfigure the application and the OS/hardware platform. To enable very aggressive optimizations, we propose to build a two-stage compiler which has a static and run-time component. The run-time component is extremely fast, works in parallel on the target machine and can read all relevant input data, and the operating system and architectural capabilities. Furthermore, to adapt the performance to variable program inputs during execution, we propose to use novel speculative run-time adaptive optimization techniques (for example, the PI&apos;s speculative parallelization and a feedback loop of performance evaluator, predictor and optimizer inputs. All this support will be enabled by a run-time library and the necessary compiler-embedded code in the executable. With this approach, the application can adapt itself and its environment to its needs by issuing appropriate commands. For instance, it is able to control data placement by the OS, control the I/O subsystem, modify coherence protocols and establish network connections. Moreover, smart applications are able to respond to the failures and large performance variations that distributed systems suffer.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The visualization and analysis of animal structure in an evolutionary context has progressed from simple &quot;eyeballing&quot; to traditional morphometrics (multivariate analysis of caliper measurements) and is now entering the new regime of geometric morphometrics. In this approach, the three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of landmarks and intervening lines or surfaces are obtained with a digitizer or from CT or similar scans. Thus, the spatial relationships among these points, lines and surfaces are&lt;br/&gt;expressly preserved. These coordinate data can be visualized as 2D and 3D images, manipulated, and statistically analyzed in high-dimensional shape space. The researchers will develop a set of database, statistical and manipulative tools to allow the rapid visualization and comparison of morphology among individuals and populations, across sex and age differences, including both extant and extinct samples, effectively forming a database of virtual morphology for computerized analysis. Reconstruction of damaged fossils from undistorted relatives, morphing of ancestral species into visualized descendants, exploration of endocranial features, tracing the evolution of brain neurochemical pathways using functional images and stereologic data across species, and combined analyses of brain and bony skull form are among the goals of this project. The focus will be on the skull and brain of the Anthropoidea or &quot;higher&quot; primates (humans, apes and monkeys), but the tools and approaches will be useful to a wide audience of zoologists and paleontologists.

      <data key="e_abstract">Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;99-73518&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neubert/Caswell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transient dynamics of ecosystems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ecological systems are subject to a wide variety of natural and anthropogenic perturbations. For example, consider a lake. On a short time scale, a rainstorm may temporarily increase the amount of nutrients in the lake, producing a brief algal bloom. On a longer time scale, acid rain might produce a permanent shift in the lake&apos;s fauna, including the possibility of species extinctions. The reaction of an ecosystem to a perturbation can have important human health or economic consequences. Ecologists and mathematicians have developed a theory to help them predict how ecosystems will respond to perturbations. While this theory has been useful, it has two principle shortcomings. First, its predictions are only expected to be correct a long time after the perturbation occurs. Second, it assumes that before the perturbation the ecosystem was in equilibrium, i.e., it assumes that none of the ecosystem&apos;s components are changing over time. The investigators on this project will develop a theory that corrects these two problems. This theory will focus on the short-term responses of ecosystems to perturbations and will incorporate non-equilibrium systems. The results of this study will be useful to ecosystem scientists working on a wide range of problems from conservation of biodiversity to global climate change, and in both terrestrial and aquatic systems.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Efficient Indexing for Spatiotemporal Applications</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Indexing spatiotemporal data is an important problem for many applications (global change, transportation, social and multimedia applications). The goal of this project is to provide efficient access methods for data whose geometry changes over time. Two time-varying spatial attributes are considered, the object position and extent. Based on the rate by which these spatial attributes change, the discrete and continuous spatiotemporal environments are identified. In the discrete environment, spatiotemporal data changes in discrete steps. Efficient ways to answer historical queries on any past state of such spatiotemporal data are examined. In particular, selection, neighbor, aggregate, join and similarity queries are addressed using a &quot;partial persistence&quot; methodology. In the continuous spatiotemporal environment, data changes continuously. Instead of keeping the data position/extent at discrete times (which would result in enormous update/storage requirements) the functions by which this data changes are stored. This introduces the novel problem of indexing functions. Using this approach, selection, neighbor and aggregation queries about future locations of moving objects in one and two dimensions are addressed. The methods used in this project are expected to achieve at least 30% improvement over traditional access methods. The applicability of the completed work reaches multiple settings, including Geographic Information Systems, multimedia databases and transportation systems. Dissemination of project findings is provided through the project&apos;s web page: http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~tsotras/spatio-temporal.html.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Although there are tools that allow access to information and data from distributed sources, there is a strong need to develop a semantic layer on top of such tools to deal with the challenging requirements of applications built from distributed software components. This research is investigating the design of an integration rule language and the development of a middle-tier, rule-processing framework for the integration of distributed, black-box components. Integration rules are active, specifying how objects react to events, and declarative, specifying the conditions under which the defined action should be executed. The rules are used within an integration framework that encapsulates the processing logic associated with the interconnection of distributed components. A user interface allows the user to graphically specify the processing logic, which is automatically translated into the appropriate integration rules. Integration rules are executed within a rule engine, which is designed to build on the recognized strengths of distributed object computing with CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) and the Java programming language. The expressiveness and use of integration rules are evaluated by case study comparisons of integrating components using imperative code versus the use of integration rules. The development of such a rule-processing environment has an immediate relevance to the integration of distributed applications, such as electronic commerce, engineering design and manufacturing, and Web-based applications, in general. This integration framework provides a rapid approach to the construction of multi-tiered applications that separate processing logic from client and data sources.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">One of the ways in which advanced network infrastructures are expected to be used in the future is to serve as the backplane for a distributed computational infrastructure. The notion of a national computational &lt;br/&gt;research grid is one of the models that has been proposed. This proposal is being funded in order to provide for planning workshops and small scale prototyping experiments that are intended to determine the requirements that applications expected to use such a grid might have. Results will be used to influence new projects and proposals for the construction of a full scale grid.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIS-9820794&lt;br/&gt;Metaxas, Dimitris&lt;br/&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;br/&gt;$150,658 - 12 mos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coupling Deformable Model and Pixel Affinity Methods for Medical Image Segmentation and 3D Organ Reconstruction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award. This research develops new and efficient methods for segmenting radiological data of internal organs and reconstructing their 3D shape, to improve clinical practice and medical&lt;br/&gt;education. These new methods allow the inclusion of image features such as patterns, textures and contours, to the storage and retrieval of data from the patient databases of the future. The methods we develop do not depend on the imaging modality used and can&lt;br/&gt;be used for any type of internal organ. However, given the focus of our current research, we segment primarily the lungs and the heart and secondarily the brain. Such data are routinely used at the University of Pennsylvania. In particular we develop 1) methods for detecting and segmenting the boundaries of internal organs, 2) methods for detecting&lt;br/&gt;abnormalities in the form of lesions, such as cancers and infections, 3) appropriate user interfaces so that the segmentation results can be superimposed on the radiological image, 4) 3D reconstructions of the shape of the internal organs using deformable models and splines, 5) the necessary evaluation procedures to test the accuracy of the segmentation methods and the efficacy of the user interface.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">The indisputable existence of a racial digital divide calls into question the democratizing potential of new technologies. Evidence that access alone will not be enough to eliminate the divide suggests a consideration of fundamental psychological factors that influence all behavior. The proposed research is a first step in testing a model of computer/Internet use. Its purpose is to develop methods and measures to examine how motivational, affective and cognitive factors influence the computer/Internet use of African Americans, and how use, in turn, influences motivation, affect and cognition. African American participants will receive home computers, participate in Internet interventions during home visits and complete survey instruments needed to test a model of computer/Internet use. Results are expected to be important to understanding why people choose to use or not use computers/Internet and the impact of use on people. Results will also be important to developing strategies for reducing the racial digital divide.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Wireless Technology: Seamless Multitier Wireless Networks for Multimedia Applications</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">In the past decade, the number of subscribers to mobile and wireless communication services has grown at an exponential rate. Concurrently, emerging wireless devices have enabled new modes of communication beyond traditional cellular voice. However, to remain continually &quot;connected,&quot; users face the frustrating task of manually coordinating a vast disarray of services, devices, and wireless technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a platform for truly seamless communication throughout environments as fundamentally different as high-speed indoor wireless and conventional cellular systems. The investigators propose to design, build, and evaluate RENE (Rice Everywhere NEtwork), a multi-tier system that provides network- and application-level services using a single network interface card. The key innovations of the RENE project are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The design of an mNIC (multi-tier Network Interface Card), a novel network interface card that is reprogrammable on-the-fly to different physical- and network-layer standards. The mNIC will support soft handoffs, both horizontally within a tier and vertically among tiers, including transitions from a prototype 100 Mbps indoor wireless LAN protocol to commercial CDMA cellular standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. The building of a proxy file system that enables seamless and consistent access to a user&apos;s home working environment, independent of the user&apos;s location or available network resources. The system will respond to changes in available capacity using transcoders, allow consistent reading and writing of files (even when transcoded), and facilitate network-awareness in unmodified applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. The investigators will perform an extensive measurement and modeling study of proxy traffic using multi-fractal models. Using these results, policies will be devised which enable the proxy to make intelligent decisions on when and to what extent to transcode or store user data to best meet user performance objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. The development of a new coarse-grained approach to resource reservation and admission control that enables users to obtain predictable performance in multi-tier environments. The key technique is to abstract system resources into networks of virtual bottleneck cells such that by provisioning resources in the virtual cells, quality of service objectives can be satisfied in the actual system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be conducted in collaboration with Nokia and Texas Instruments in order to build a complete prototype implementation of the RENE system and demonstrate its capabilities.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Robust Algorithms for Restricted Domains</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Sometimes, restricting the domain of interest makes a hard problem easy. For example, one can find the minimum vertex cover of a bipartite graph in polynomial time even though the general problem is NP-hard. Sometimes, restricting the domain does not make a problem easier. For example, finding the minimum vertex cover of a planar graph is NP-hard. &lt;br/&gt; This project is to study issues relating to problems whose instances come from classes obtained by natural restrictions on more general classes. Many subtleties which arise naturally in dealing with such problems have been glossed over in the literature. Perhaps the most common interpretation of solving a problem on a retricted class is the &quot;promise&quot; version, in which there is a guarantee that the input is in the class, and an algorithm to &quot;solve&quot; the problem need not function correctly (or even terminate) if this guarantee is not met. This research is based on different definition, one in which the algorithm must produce correct output even if the input is not in the restricted class; such output may either be &quot;the input is not in the class&quot; or the correct solution to the problem. &lt;br/&gt; The new definition of solving proglems on restricted domains requires algorithms to be &quot;robust: in the face of invalid input, a more stringent requirement than &quot;don&apos;t care.&quot; Robust algorithms are amenable to manipulation as building blocks of more general algorithms; in contrast, &quot;promise&quot; algorithms are not. Furthermore, there exist problems which are in P in the &quot;promise&quot; version of solving a problem, while being NP-hard under the new definition. Arguments can be made that the hardness results are sometimes more meaningful, necessitating a revamping of the notion of restricted class NP-completeness.&lt;br/&gt; Graph classes provide interesting and natural restricted domains; the project will also study many problems on graph classes which satisfy the twin requirements of being:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Easy to solve given a special and natural representation of a graph (i.e., a &quot;model&quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Open with respect to complexity if the graph is given in a general form such as an adjacency list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While some of these open problems appear to be quite hard, they are not easily classifiable as &quot;really&quot; being hard. This is because the model provides a certificate for the problem to be in NP and in co-NP; consequently, such problems can be NP-hard only if NP = co-NP. An operational notion of intractability is needed for several such problems and the project will investigate possibilities</data>

The grant supports the development, testing and dissemination of web-based courseware derived primarily from research carried out by the Department of Energy ASCI Alliance Center on Simulation of Accidental Fires and Explosions (C-SAFE) at the University of Utah. The courseware is being developed in conjunction with Northern Arizona University and Worcester Polytechnic Institute as dissemination sites. Thus, the course material is being utilized by three very different undergraduate audiences: (1) a Research 1 institution, (2) a private institution whose primary mission is undergraduate education, and (3) a four-year institution serving a significant Native American student population. It is expected that the courseware, combined with research activity, both at the University of Utah and at the national labs, will create a national center for large-scale simulation science and education.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Computation and communication technologies have the potential to improve coordination in dynamic task and team situations. To realize that potential a deep understanding of the coordination processes used by teams is required. This project investigates the coordination processes used by distributed teams of experts operating in a highly dynamic work domain -- a trauma patient resuscitation unit. The main objective is to develop a framework for modeling coordination processes by team members in dynamic, multi-tasking, highly stressful environments. An interdisciplinary team with wide-ranging research backgrounds including team performance, information technologies, medicine, nursing, health care informatics, management sciences, biomedical engineering and ethnography will conduct the project. Qualitative and quantitative methods including ethnographic studies, surveys and interviews will be used to capture coordination processes in situ in trauma center settings. The project will result in a better understanding of the role of various communication media and how each medium is used in dynamic work settings to achieve work coordination and maintain adequate awareness. A set of design principles will be developed that can guide the deployment of communication-computation systems in domains where tasks are highly dynamic and accomplished by multi-disciplinary teams.</data>

      <data key="e_title">Coordination Processes and Awareness Support in Dynamic Work Environments</data>
      <data key="e_abstract">Computation and communication technologies have the potential to improve coordination in dynamic task and team situations. To realize that potential a deep understanding of the coordination processes used by teams is required. This project investigates the coordination processes used by distributed teams of experts operating in a highly dynamic work domain -- a trauma patient resuscitation unit. The main objective is to develop a framework for modeling coordination processes by team members in dynamic, multi-tasking, highly stressful environments. An interdisciplinary team with wide-ranging research backgrounds including team performance, information technologies, medicine, nursing, health care informatics, management sciences, biomedical engineering and ethnography will conduct the project. Qualitative and quantitative methods including ethnographic studies, surveys and interviews will be used to capture coordination processes in situ in trauma center settings. The project will result in a better understanding of the role of various communication media and how each medium is used in dynamic work settings to achieve work coordination and maintain adequate awareness. A set of design principles will be developed that can guide the deployment of communication-computation systems in domains where tasks are highly dynamic and accomplished by multi-disciplinary teams.</data>

      <data key="e_abstract">Lenski et al.&lt;br/&gt;9981397&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators define biocomplexity as the dynamic web of interactions among genes, organisms, and environments. They will investigate the emergence of biocomplexity and examine its consequences for the performance of living organisms and ecological communities. Parallel experiments will be performed with two very different systems, in order to study general principles. One system employs bacteria, and the other system is digital. The latter consists of special computer programs that self-replicate, mutate, and evolve novel sequences of instructions to solve problems. One set of experiments will monitor the evolution of ecosystem complexity, in which a single progenitor diverges into multiple types that perform distinct functions by exploiting different resources. Follow-up experiments will examine the effects of removing member species on the remainder of the community. Another project will develop the software used for studying digital organisms into an educational tool.&lt;br/&gt;This project, which is being supported by the Directorates for Biological Sciences, Computer Information Science and Engineering, Engineering, and by the division of Mathematical Sciences and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, will impact several scientific fields, and the findings may provide basic information useful for both environmental and biotechnological applications. For example, ecologists may find principles useful for improving the performance of beneficial organisms in the environment. Computer scientists may discover computational strategies, evolved by real organisms that can be employed in developing more complex software.</data>
