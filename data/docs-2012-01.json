(i) For dynamics at large timescales, network planning and topology optimization will be investigated based on the concept of algebraic connectivity. (ii) For mid-timescale dynamics, effective load balancing and adaptive multipath routing will be developed.

New \"crowdsourcing\" platforms like Amazon's Mechanical Turk make it easier than ever to harness human computational power by streamlining job posting, tracking, and payment for workers. However, the lack of automation means that crowdsourcing currently does not scale up. Low quality results must be filtered out, but checking human computations can be difficult. Economic incentives and anonymity expose crowdsourcing to fraud. Deciding how much to pay workers for particular tasks and how many workers to hire remains an art.<br\/><br\/>This project introduces crowdprogramming, an approach that fully integrates human and digital computation.

This approach lets programmers focus on programming logic, while the crowdprogramming runtime system manages the critical tradeoffs between cost, time, and data quality. Crowdprogramming will dramatically lower the barriers to harnessing human computational power. It will enable a rich new class of applications that divide labor between digital and human computations, where computers and humans do the work each does best. It will enable complex orchestration of human computations, automatically control quality to maintain high accuracy and avoid fraud, and schedule tasks and adjust payments to maximize speed while staying within budget.

Example sources include various sensors, RFID, computer network traffic, phone conversations, and web searches. Much of this data is noisy, inconsistent, or even erroneous.

Information and coding theories give us a near-perfect understanding of the capacity of networks, such as the Internet or mobile networks, to transmit information.

Yet the Internet's interdomain routing architecture, which requires coordination among domains, remains mired in inflexibility. Indeed, many of the key shortcomings of the Internet's architecture --- including unreliability, inefficient resource allocation, and insecurity --- can be attributed in large part to inflexible routing. The Internet's BGP and IP protocols offer only a single path to each destination, and this path may be broken, inefficient, or insecure.<br\/><br\/>This project is developing an approach to bring flexibility to the Internet's routing and forwarding architecture. To break through the current logjam of inflexible routing, the project is advancing source-controlled routing (SCR) as an architectural approach to enable fundamentally more flexible routing. Rather than embedding the routing decisions within the network, routing decisions are a parameter to the network chosen at the source, i.e., the user's device or one acting on its behalf. That flexibility yields solutions to multiple problems, including reliability, performance, and protection from certain traffic attraction attacks.<br\/><br\/>To achieve a viable SCR architecture, the project is solving three key challenges: policy flexibility of the core architecture; security; and scalability. First, while past SCR architectures gave route control to users, they took away control from network owners and operators. The key need is \"policy flexibility\" in the architecture, to enable SCR without limiting network owners' control. The project is developing a formal theory of policy flexibility and designing an architecture which achieves high policy flexibility. Second, the project is quantifying the vulnerability of SCR architectures to denial-of-service attacks and developing techniques to limit the worst-case damage attackers can inflict. Third, the project is developing techniques for sources to utilize flexible routing in a scalable way, improving latency and reliability of Internet communications.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact.The result of this project will be the theoretical foundations, design, and implementation of an Internet architecture that offers significant gains to areas which are the most critical challenges for the Internet today --- including reliability, performance, and security. The project's theoretically-grounded research methodology, including a novel theory of protocol flexibility, will be integrated with education via development of material for a graduate-level \"Theory of Computer Networks\" course and survey papers.

The improvement in CMOS technology for the past several decades has led to remarkable progress in electronic system capabilities and complexity. As we reach the physical limits of this progress, there is a need to explore radical new technologies and corresponding circuits that will enable similar progress in the future. This project explores the use of magnetic state of electrons, rather than the typical measure of total electron charge, to define the logic states that represent the signal information. Since magnetic state has previously been used only to construct memory or storage devices, its use for logic circuits requires this project to explore and co-optimize novel magnetic devices and new circuit technologies that incorporate them.<br\/><br\/><br\/>Through direct collaboration with industry, the aforementioned novel devices and circuits could enable new electronic products and markets in the semiconductor industry. Furthermore, collaboration is planned with Entrepreneuring Youth (www.eyouthamerica.org), a nonprofit organization in Pittsburgh that designs middle school and high school programs that use entrepreneurial learning and business creation to engage young people in learning. The technical aspects of this work will be used as a platform to expand the coverage of magnetics in the middle schools, high schools and undergraduate college curriculums.","title":"EAGER: Preliminary Studies on Novel Four-Terminal Spin Transfer Torque Devices to Enable All-Magnetic Logic Circuits","awardID":"1146799","effectiveDate":"2012-01-01","expirationDate":"2013-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2878","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CCF"}}],"PIcoPI":[500881,"549747"],"PO":["562984"]},"187107":{"abstract":"Attacks on software applications such as email readers and web browsers are common. These attacks can cause damages ranging from application malfunction, loss of private data, to a complete takeover of users' computers. One effective strategy for limiting the damage is to adopt the principle of least privilege in application design: the application is split into several protection domains and each domain is given only the necessary privileges to perform its task. In this design, the compromise of one domain does not directly lead to the compromise of other security-sensitive domains. The PI proposes to design and implement a framework that makes it easy for software developers to apply the principle of least privilege to their applications. The proposed framework will significantly improve the security of critical software applications. It will benefit the software industry by designing new technologies for building secure software systems.<br\/><br\/>The proposed research combines several novel ideas: (1) user-space protection domains through binary-level enforcement of isolation and information-flow security; (2) a declarative language that allows for flexible configuration of an application's security architecture; (3) a binary-level partitioning tool that automatically splits an application into components of least privilege; (4) a compositional reasoning mechanism that allows developers to perform formal reasoning about an application's end-to-end information security. By staying in the user space, the proposed framework is OS independent, and by working on binary code, it is source-language agnostic, making it more broadly applicable. Developers can use it to partition an application, flexibly configure its security architecture, and reason about its information security. On the education side, the PI will organize a series of activities to increase high school students' awareness of security, privacy, and secure programming. The central activity is a summer workshop that gathers local high-school technology teachers and helps them design lesson plans that can be integrated into their schools' technology curriculum.","title":"CAREER: User-Space Protection Domains for Compositional Information Security","awardID":"1149211","effectiveDate":"2012-01-01","expirationDate":"2016-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"8060","name":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace"}}],"PIcoPI":["517943"],"PO":["564388"]},"192530":{"abstract":"In this proposal, the PIs are planning, organizing, and chairing a National Science Foundation (NSF) workshop on Security of Cloud Computing Services and Systems.

The US network will collaborate with international sustainability research networks (in Australia, EU, Asia) and with a network of practitioners and policymakers in US and global cities. RCN activities will lead to the development of (a) inter-disciplinary systems framework(s) to represent linkages between people, infrastructures and the natural system, from the city-scale to the global scale, that shape sustainability outcomes in cities, (b) harmonized methods and international data standards to operationalize the framework, to report, for example, the carbon footprints of cities, water vulnerability of cities, or to analyze social actors who shape urban infrastructures and consumption patterns toward sustainability, (c) a network of 12 global cities for testing the framework and its component theories and models\/methods in cities with different natural, infrastructural, socioeconomic and cultural characteristics, (d) a virtual collaborative forum to share research methods, experiences and teaching tools across more than 20+ US universities on the common thematic area of sustainable cities. The RCN will provide science based systems analysis tools, much needed by more than 1000 cities worldwide that are developing sustainability plans addressing energy, water and climate change. A unique aspect of this RCN is broad-based integration across urban ecology, industrial ecology, atmospheric sciences, infrastructure engineering, architecture, urban planning, behavioral sciences, public affairs and public health toward the goal of sustainable cities. Cross-discipline integration, coordination of data across scales, and cross-city comparisons are expected to advance the science of sustainable cities. The RCN has potential to impact more than 1200 students in participating US universities and 65 million people in the network of cities where field work will be coordinated.

Research reports published in the CHI Conference Proceedings and the CHI Extended Abstracts are heavily-refereed and widely cited; they are among the most scientifically respected and impactful research publications in the field of HCI. CHI 2012 will focus on the centrality of experience, from the models, theories and practical insights needed to understand and design for user experience to the irreplaceable value of experiencing innovation in the HCI field through hands-on interactivity. More information about the conference is available at http:\/\/chi2012.acm.org.<br\/><br\/>The Doctoral Consortium is a research-focused meeting that has taken place annually at the CHI conference since 1986, and has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding HCI researchers. Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference. Student participants will make formal presentations of their research during the workshop, and will receive feedback from the faculty panel. The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. Student participants will present their work to the doctoral consortium on May 5-6, with follow up activities planned during the technical program of the conference. Extended abstracts of the students' work will be published in the CHI 2012 Extended Abstracts, which has wide print and electronic distribution. SIGCHI's conference management committee will evaluate the doctoral consortium, and the results will be made available to the organizers of future consortia.

Applications are encouraged from all doctoral students whose research is HCI-related, regardless of the fields in which they are earning their degrees. While NSF funds will be used chiefly to support participation by students enrolled in graduate programs in the United States, some international participants may be supported as well in recognition of the fact that the HCI field embraces educational and cultural traditions that vary in different parts of the world. The organizers have undertaken to work to identify and include the broadest possible group of highly qualified participants; as a consequence, the student and faculty participants will constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, which will help broaden the students' horizons to the future benefit of the field.","title":"Workshop: Human-Computer Interaction Doctoral Research Consortium at Association for Computing Machinery Computer-Human Interaction 2012","awardID":"1208510","effectiveDate":"2012-01-01","expirationDate":"2012-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[513299],"PO":["565227"]},"190728":{"abstract":"This award suppors the international travel of 10 US scientists to attend the Grid Computing - The Next Decade workshop that will be held in January 4-6, 2012, in Zakopane, Poland.

The situation is exacerbated by the increasingly widespread use of multicore processors, whose computing power can only be unleashed by concurrent software. Automation of this detection and repair process promises to drastically reduce the time spent in debugging such systems, leading to reliable and secure software as well as fully utilized parallel hardware. The objective of this research is to improve the concurrent software reliability and security through innovations in automated concurrency debugging. <br\/><br\/>This project will investigate new theoretical and algorithmic advances, and tools to fully automate the crucial process of bug detection, diagnosis, repair, and optimization for large concurrent software. The unifying theme of this research is the judicious application of logical constraint based symbolic methods and automated thread interference abstractions.

This suggests that both speakers and listeners efficiently deal with the uncertainty and noise inherent to perception, production, and the environment. This CAREER award investigates how the human brain accomplishes this. A mathematical model of efficient communication based on probability and information theory (the Ideal Speaker model) is tested against data from conversational speech. Specifically, the project investigates how the pronunciation of words in spontaneous speech depends on words' expected confusability in context, the cognitive load the speaker is under and the situational incentive for robust communication. The Ideal Speaker model also predicts that efficient communication with a particular interlocutor requires adaptation to that interlocutor, a prediction that the project tests in behavioral paradigms against task-oriented speech production. <br\/><br\/>The project contributes to our understanding of how humans produce language, why language has the properties it has, and to what extent the neural systems underlying language production can adjust to different communicative task demands. These insights can contribute to the development of better automatic speech recognition systems (this project is limited to the evaluation of such systems). In addition, novel paradigms to gather large amounts of language data are developed that will dramatically cut research costs. Finally, training in the emerging field of computational psycholinguistics is provided to a broad international audience via summer schools and workshops. This will contribute to a new generation of multidisciplinary scientists working across traditional boundaries between computer science, linguistics, and cognitive psychology.","title":"CAREER: Communicative Efficiency and Adaptiveness in the Ideal Speaker","awardID":"1150028","effectiveDate":"2012-01-01","expirationDate":"2016-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0404","name":"Division of BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE SCI","abbr":"BCS"},"pgm":{"id":"7252","name":"PERCEPTION, ACTION & COGNITION"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["554036"],"PO":["565215"]},"187260":{"abstract":"CAREER: Understanding, Representing, and Enhancing Scenes at the Internet-scale<br\/><br\/>Photography has an enormous impact on society -- it is our primary visual history and a medium for storytelling, entertainment, and art. But our visual world is extraordinarily complex which makes it difficult for computer vision to understand photos and for computer graphics to synthesize visual content. However, the emergence of Internet-scale photo collections in recent years enables new research directions. We use scene-based representations to leverage Internet-scale data. Scenes (places or environments) are the context in which all other visual phenomena exist and it seems possible to brute-force the space of scenes -- with millions of scenes, we find qualitatively similar scenes and create massively data-driven algorithms with capabilities that are complementary to typical bottom-up graphics and vision pipelines. The underlying principle of this study is that joint investigations of scene representations and large image databases will advance the state-of-the-art in graphics and vision. <br\/><br\/>First, we are investigating detail synthesis tasks which alleviate camera shake, motion blur, defocus, atmospheric scattering, or low resolution. Scene representations are robust enough to find matching scenes in Internet-scale photo collections even in the presence of dramatic blurring. These matching scenes provide a context-specific statistical model which can be used to insert convincing texture and object detail. Second, we are studying attribute-based representations of scenes. We use crowdsourcing to discover attributes and build large databases for the community. Attributes are a powerful intermediate representation for the next generation of big data imaging research which can have broad societal impact through applications such as robotics, security, assistance to vision-impaired, and vehicle safety. The investigators also are developing a new introductory course for Brown students to explore big data computing across scientific disciplines and are creating an online community for visual computing education to benefit students interested in photography and programming.","title":"CAREER: Representing, Understanding, and Enhancing Scenes at the Internet-Scale","awardID":"1149853","effectiveDate":"2012-01-15","expirationDate":"2016-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7453","name":"GRAPHICS & VISUALIZATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["528661"],"PO":["565227"]},"187150":{"abstract":"As Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) employing mobile nodes continue to integrate into the physical world, ensuring their safety and security become crucial goals.

Such increase in complexity widens the malicious opportunities for adversaries and with many components interacting together, distinguishing between normal and abnormal behaviors becomes quite challenging.<br\/><br\/>The research work in this project falls along two main thrusts: (1) identifying stealthy attacks and (2) developing defense mechanisms. Along the first thrust, a unifying theoretical framework is developed to uncover attacks in a systematic manner whereby an adversary solves Markovian Decision Processes problems to identify optimal and suboptimal attack policies. The effects of the attacks are assessed through different instantiations of damage and cost metrics.

The major intellectual contribution of the efforts proposed in this proposal will be to develop a design software for monolayer devices that is based on fundamental physics yet will exploit the increasing computational capability made available through multi-core architecture and super computing clusters for real time and realistically sized device simulation. The general software will be an integrated tool that describes electron and spin transport in monolayer devices in presence of dissipation mechanisms within a full quantum description and also extend those numerical results to compact models appropriate for circuit and system level simulation. This work will thus, on one hand, advance the fundamental understanding of electronic and spin transport in monolayer 2D materials and on the other, make it possible to take those insights to circuit and system level, thereby fostering disruptive innovation in design and optimization with these emerging materials. <br\/><br\/><br\/>As the Si based CMOS technology runs its course, new materials with novel functionalities will be necessary to continue the growth of electronics that contributes significantly to the US economy and also to ensure US leadership in computing technologies.

A number of UC-Berkeley-run programs will be leveraged to include undergraduate researchers specifically focusing on minority and women.

Towards this goal, a radically new information theoretical framework will be developed with three critical components: (1) an analytical information model to quantitatively measure the number of information bits stored in a given memory system, (2) a number of different circuit implementation options to achieve maximum-information storage, and (3) a comprehensive study of high-level performance metrics (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio) to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed MIMS system in real-life signal processing applications.
