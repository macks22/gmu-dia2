This research will provide a source of primary empirical data through ethnographic inquiry focusing on both the urban homeless and the social service networks that support them; this empirical dataset will be used to drive the creation, deployment, and evaluation of a series of technological interventions that leverage mobile technologies for collaboration between services and their homeless clients, personalized information delivery, and user-generated content creation and dissemination. <br\/><br\/>Research in human-computer interaction has long focused on \"environments of plenty\" such as workplaces with dedicated networks and computers, and trained support staff to ensure that everything works as intended. Recent work, however, has pointed out the degree to which focusing outside this narrow slice can result in innovative technology that is more broadly useful. This research project will substantially contribute to this thread of work by exploring the challenges and opportunities for technological intervention in a community outside the \"environment of plenty\": focusing upon the urban homeless in the U.S. This research will provide important data about the opportunities for technology use among the homeless and those who work with them; it will also lead to the creation of new technology and services to support mobile phone-based information delivery. This research will further broaden our understanding of the role computing can play in under-served communities.","title":"HCC-Small: Technology at the Margins: The Urban Homeless as a Lens on the Needs of Users Outside the Mainstream","awardID":"0915624","effectiveDate":"2009-07-15","expirationDate":"2013-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[408974,"472141"],"PO":["564456"]},"153472":{"abstract":"CIF: Small: Primitives for Cryptography and Communications <br\/><br\/>Principal Investigator: Andrew Klapper, University of Kentucky <br\/><br\/>Pseudorandom sequences and highly nonlinear functions are essential for <br\/>digital communications and information technology.

There are many approaches to robot control, such as teleoperation, handcoding, and planning, speech and gesture instruction, each with strengths and shortcomings. Learning from demonstration (LfD) is a compelling alternative in which robots are programmed implicitly from a user's demonstration rather than explicitly through an intermediate form (e.g., hardcoded program) or task-unrelated secondary skills (e.g., computer programming).

Although existing power management methods have proven to be successful in many IC modules, as structural and algorithmic complexity keep increasing, these methods expose the limitations in the aspects of speed, power consumption and complexity. This project is to conduct a comprehensive study on power computing, modeling, management and optimization. By developing a generic physical model for multi-core systems, the project introduces a concept of using analog computation to solve multi-variable global power optimization problems. Analog computation provides a much faster, more accurate, real-time solution than the digital counterparts. A hardware-based approach, through a multiple-output converter design, is proposed, which works harmoniously with the power optimizer to incorporate converter-consciousness into voltage\/frequency scheduling. Further extension of global and converter-conscious concepts leads to a leakage-aware universal power management solution on a single hardware platform.

The press is filled with articles on information overload, multitasking, fragmented attention, and the accelerating pace of life. And there is a growing body of scientific literature that bears on these issues, demonstrating in particular that multitasking degrades human performance. New technologies are sometimes suggested as a way to alleviate the problem. This study explores a different but complementary approach: training users through meditation to work more effectively and less stressfully with existing information technologies. The PI will offer people training in meditation and then test their ability to perform a set of time-limited information-intensive tasks. While prior studies of the efficacy of meditation have provided experimental evidence that such training helps people maintain focus and reduce interference resulting from distraction, no one has yet attempted to demonstrate such effects specifically in relation to the use of information technology. The PI's goal in this study is to do just this. Human resources personnel in San Francisco and Seattle will be recruited to attend eight weeks of training in either meditation or relaxation. Participants will be given a test of their multitasking abilities (involving the use of e-mail, instant messaging, phones, and face-to-face conversation in an office-like setting) both before and after the training, and their performance will be evaluated along four dimensions: accuracy; time to completion; satisfaction and well-being; and memory for the task. Project outcomes will thus make a contribution both to the growing body of scientific literature demonstrating that multitasking degrades human performance, as well as to the largely separate literature demonstrating that meditation training can help people maintain focus and reduce interference resulting from distraction, and will serve as a bridge between them.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: There is growing evidence that rampant multitasking and accelerated modes of working can result in health problems and diminished effectiveness. If it can be demonstrated that meditation training diminishes some of these negative effects, then the door will be open to creating ameliorative training for both students and adult workers.","title":"EAGER: An Empirical Exploration of Contemplative Multitasking","awardID":"0942646","effectiveDate":"2009-07-15","expirationDate":"2012-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[427132,"522921"],"PO":["565227"]},"151020":{"abstract":"The PI seeks to design and investigate novel features and strategies for use of virtual reality based haptic simulations to retrain impaired motor functions and train new fine motor skills in veterans (medics) with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Previous approaches to haptic simulation design have typically focused on completeness of presentation relative to reality. However, simulators may be used for many different tasks, so completeness may not ensure usefulness. The PIs argue that the role of the simulation for a user and its required functionality are the more important design questions, and that consideration of critical applications like motor skill training in haptic simulation design will promote effective design from a human performance perspective. Thus, they propose a cognitive-oriented approach to haptic simulation design and evaluation. In this project, the PIs will test their ideas by designing and prototyping advanced VR haptic simulators for drawing and surgical tasks. The simulations will be defined in terms of the type and resolution of (medical) data sources used for virtual object modeling, the type of visual and force presentation for motor skill and brain function assessment, and the approach to graphic and haptic rendering of the simulation. Through human factors experimentation with the simulations, the PIs will also assess interventional strategies for motor development, including virtual haptic aids (e.g., force boundaries and potentials) and force graduation across rehabilitation trials. Finally, they will validate the effect of the haptic simulations on neurocognitive and motor performance using behavioral indices and advanced magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Cognitive tasks analyses will be conducted with expert neuropsychologists and surgeons on psychomotor task performance and surgical operations to inform the simulation design process. Simulation design manipulations will include source data reduction through approximation of point-cloud data using graphical methods, development of a haptic-based motor skill training workstation with an effective human-computer interface, and optimization of visual and haptic representation using GPU-based graphics and a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model for reduction of CPU overhead in haptic object rendering with force feedback. The simulation design will also reflect results on baseline motor performance and VR drawing and surgical simulator practice. This testing will be followed by fMRI of subjects in motor tasks in order to examine activation of brain regions mediating motor control. Subsequently, a series of motor training sessions will be conducted using the haptic simulators. Subjects will be exposed to the various settings of the simulation design parameters along with the virtual haptic aids and gradual reduction of force feedback, relative to nominal forces, across sessions. Post-therapy motor and simulator tests, as well as follow-up fMRI scanning, will be conducted. Motor recovery and neuroimaging of brain regions mediating motor performance will provide evidence of the effectiveness of the simulation design and rehabilitation efficacy. The PIs' hypothesize that experience with a haptic simulation design based on motor skill training demands and human performance metrics will accelerate skill development relative to a fidelity-centered approach to design. They also expect that haptic-simulator experience will improve fine motor control and motor planning (praxis), that experience on the drawing-simulation device will generalize to improved performance on the surgical-simulation device, and that brain blood flow will increase in regions mediating motor control.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This work will make contributions to the design of computer graphics and haptic rendering, in terms of better understanding of optimal computational modeling for VR haptic simulation. It will also advance the state of the art in computer-based therapeutic approaches to motor skill development with haptic simulation, and enhance our understanding of brain-behavior relationships governing motor output and the nature of neural recovery following motor rehabilitation. Improvements in existing VR-based rehabilitation strategies for motor and praxis impairment in individuals suffering from TBI will be identified; rehabilitation treatment regimens will be identified that may have implications for various populations suffering from brain injuries (e.g., stroke patients).","title":"HCC: Medium: Haptic Simulation Design for Motor Rehabilitation and Skill Training","awardID":"0905505","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2013-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[402585,402586,"564759"],"PO":["565227"]},"151031":{"abstract":"From Frames to Events: A Statistical Approach to Activity Analysis in Multi-Camera Systems<br\/><br\/>Venkatesh Saligrama and Janusz Konrad, Boston University, MA 02215<br\/><br\/>Unlike other sensors, cameras provide excellent resolution, long viewing range,<br\/>wide field of view and low latency thus permitting pervasive, wide-area visual<br\/>surveillance.

Virtual reality environments rely on a collection of technologies that allow the user to go through a coherent and unified perceptual experience involving multiple senses, such as vision, touch, and sound, while interacting with 3-dimensional data. These immersive, highly visual, 3D environments currently offer a fairly high level of performance for spatially visualizing data. However, the corresponding machinery providing user interaction with these systems has not kept up the same pace of development with the visualization tools. At present some advanced commercial environments offer some user interaction capabilities achieved through wired wearable hardware (such as wired gloves and head mounted displays). This promotes, in turn, an unnatural and cumbersome interaction between the user and the virtual reality environments, curbing the acceptance of the technologies. The syntax and semantics of the hand and finger gestures developed interacts with geometric data, while the implementation relies on the Multi-Touch Surface computing platform as well as on a newly developed gesture tracking and recognition system. The environment should lead to a potent open platform for interacting with virtual geometric data in an intuitive way, without the need for wearable hardware galvanizing the state of the art at the institution in Nano and Design Engineering, Psychology, Computer Science, Structural biology, as well as support research in the Center for Health, Intervention, and Prevention (CHIP).

The goal of this project is to design novel techniques and develop tools to efficiently query and retrieve relevant information in a heterogeneous data environment where flexibility in conditions on both the content, the structure of the data, and the response to a query is desirable. The first main contribution of the project is the design of quality scoring mechanisms that unify content and structure score in an integrated fashion. The scoring techniques take into account the similarity between the query and the answer to assign scores. The second main contribution of the project is the development of heterogeneous data index structures and query processing algorithms to efficiently identify exact and approximate query answers and provide the answers in the order of relevance to a query. The work resulting from this project will be evaluated through an in-depth study of the impact of the scoring strategies on answer quality and performance experiments on the query processing techniques. <br\/><br\/>The results of this project are expected to enable users to identify the data that best fits their needs, in a variety of heterogeneous data environments, without requiring some preexisting knowledge of the underlying data schema or content.

On the acquired database, the research team studies and models the bivariate statistics of luminance, chrominance, range, and disparity . In the eye movement studies, the locations of visual fixations are measured as they land in range space against where they land in luminance, chromatic, and disparity space, making it possible to develop gaze-contingent models of the statistics of luminance, chrominance, range, and disparity. The results of these studies have broad significance in vision science and image processing. To exemplify this, new approaches to computational stereo and to stereo image quality assessment are developed. New computational stereo algorithms are developed using appropriate prior and posterior distribution models on disparity. Further, new algorithms are developed for stereopair image quality assessment using the statistical models that we will develop. These new algorithms dramatically impact the emerging 3-D digital cinema, gaming, and television industries, allowing for automatic assessment of 3D presentations to human viewers.

However, it is still a significant open challenge to understand the complex interactions between an agent's nervous system, its body and its environment. This project focuses on mathematical methods for analyzing the flow of information in models of situated and embodied cognitive agents. Specifically, the investigator will (1) develop new information-theoretic tools that characterize the flow of information over time throughout the system, (2) test and refine these methods on evolved model brain-body-environment systems, and (3) use these techniques and models to explore the unique advantages of embodiment and situatedness for a cognitive agent.<br\/><br\/>The new analysis techniques build on the notion of conditional mutual information between random variables at specific points in time. For example, conditioning the mutual information between a stimulus feature and a state variable at time t on the information that state variable contains about the stimulus feature at time t-1 allows one to compute a measure of information gain. Similar measures can be used to compute the information loss or retention. This basic approach will be extended in several different directions. Information factoring, which builds on the notion of transfer entropy, will allow the interactions between system components to be characterized in terms of directional information flow. Information backtracking will offer a refined portrait of the structure of these interactions by tracing backwards in time from particular informational configurations of the system to determine the flows that produce them. Specific information spectra will be used to explore the informational relationships between particular values taken on by components of the system, allowing the structure of their interactions to be probed at a finer level of detail. These methods will be applied to evolved models of relational categorization, referential communication, and visually guided behavior, allowing the following questions to be explored: How do embodied agents extract, store, and suppress information? How do embodied agents integrate information about multiple features? What is the relationship between informational and dynamical properties? Finally, these techniques will be used to characterize the capabilities of embodied and situated agents, including information self-structuring, information offloading, and embodied information transfer. These analysis methods are expected to have applications not only to brain-body-environment systems, but also to other complex biological and social networks.","title":"RI: Small: The Dynamics of Information Flow in Embodied Cognitive Systems","awardID":"0916409","effectiveDate":"2009-07-15","expirationDate":"2013-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["517345"],"PO":["564318"]},"152550":{"abstract":"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)<br\/><br\/>This research focuses on combining foundational and lightweight formal<br\/>methods to verify the safety, security, and dependability of<br\/>large-scale software systems.

Virtually no practical algorithms exist for synthesizing synchronized sounds automatically. Instead, sound recordings are edited manually for pre-produced animations or triggered automatically in interactive settings. The former is labor intensive and inflexible, while the latter produces awkward, repetitive results. This situation is a serious obstacle to building realistic, interactive simulations (whether for entertainment, training, or other applications), which require sound to be compelling,. In this research the PIs will begin filling this broad void by pursuing fundamental advances in computational methods while solving several particularly challenging sound rendering problems. The goal is to produce some of the first viable methods in this area, upon which many more can be built. Successful implementation of this program will fundamentally transform our relationship with our increasingly convincing simulated realities, because for the first time we will be able to hear them as well as see them. To these ends, the PIs will develop fundamental algorithms that address the problems of simulating the vibrations that cause sound and computing the sound field produced by those vibrations.<br\/><br\/>1) Reduced-order vibration models. Simulating vibration in complex structures is expensive because of the need for both high model complexity and audio-rate temporal resolution. The PIs will develop dimensional model reduction methods to enable efficient sound rendering from complex, nonlinearly vibrating geometry, such as thin shells.<br\/><br\/>2) All-frequency sound radiation. Realistic sound requires computing the radiated sound field from a vibrating surface over the very broad range of audible frequencies. But existing methods are either inaccurate for low frequencies or impractical for high frequencies. The PIs will develop hybrid algorithms based on a broad toolbox and discover which methods are most successful for which problems.<br\/><br\/>Complementing the algorithmic work, the PIs will pursue solutions to a series of difficult, unsolved sound rendering problems that are of value in applications:<br\/><br\/>a) Harmonic fluid sounds. Few sounds are as distinctive as pouring a glass of water or the babbling of a brook, yet no algorithms exist to compute these sounds automatically. The PIs will investigate practical algorithms for harmonic bubble-based sound radiation characteristic of splashing fluids.<br\/><br\/>b) Multi-object sound. Sounds made by collections of objects in contact (think of a bin of LEGOs or a basket of blocks) involve close-proximity effects that are often ignored. The PIs will develop sound rendering methods to approximate multi-object contact sounds with object-object interactions.<br\/><br\/>c) Fracture. Brittle fracture creates distinctive sounds during destructive processes like breakage of glass.

In the future, the methods developed in this project or their successors will completely transform how sound is computed in interactive virtual environments.","title":"HCC: Medium: Sound Rendering for Physically Based Simulation","awardID":"0905506","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2014-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7453","name":"GRAPHICS & VISUALIZATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["448639","508159",402591],"PO":["565227"]},"151054":{"abstract":"Quantum computation has forced a dramatic change in our beliefs about the foundations of computer science, the security of cryptosystems, and the nature of quantum systems. This award focuses on several fundamental algorithmic questions that arise out of this viewpoint. The first is the design of new quantum algorithms. The challenge here is that the major paradigm for the design of quantum algorithms - the hidden subgroup framework - has recently been shown to have severe limitations in its applicability. The center will explore several approaches, including a new framework for the design of quantum algorithms via the quantum approximation of tensor networks, as well as recent work on the use of quantum algorithms for discovering hidden nonlinear structures.<br\/><br\/>Establishing the limits of quantum algorithms is equally important to the possibility of designing efficient classical cryptosystems that are immune to quantum cryptanalysis. Such \"post-quantum\" cryptosystems could have an enormous practical impact well before the first working quantum computer is ever built. For this to happen it is necessary to better understand the quantum hardness of concrete classical cryptosystems such as the lattice-based cryptosystems or the McEliese cryptosystem. A different approach would involve designing novel cryptosystems whose security is based on already established quantum hardness results in the hidden subgroup framework.<br\/><br\/>The center would also study fundamental questions in quantum complexity theory, including the complexity of quantum interactive proof systems. Arguably the most important challenge is proving the quantum analog of the celebrated PCP theorem. This would have wide implications including quantum hardness of inapproximability results, improved fault-tolerance results for adiabatic quantum computing, as well as implications for theoretical condensed matter physics. Another fundamental question is the power of multi-prover quantum interactive proof systems. Resolving whether or not this complexity class is NEXP as in the celebrated classical result MIP = NEXP, is expected to provide important insights into the nature of quantum entanglement.","title":"AF: Medium: Center for Quantum Algorithms and Complexity","awardID":"0905626","effectiveDate":"2009-07-15","expirationDate":"2014-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7926","name":"ALGORITHMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7928","name":"QUANTUM COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[402689],"PO":["565157"]},"158930":{"abstract":"This grant supports student travel to a Doctoral Symposium taking place in conjunction with the International Conference on Software Reuse.

Coupling with other components, such as user interfaces, transactional data and archives will be increasingly important. For stream queries to be robust over extended execution periods, they must have the means to adapt to both internal and external changes. Changes in input rates, time lags and data distributions can cause shifts in internal memory and processing loads. Operators must adapt to these changes both local and in concert with other operators. Variations in client demands create opportunities for improved resource use to which operators must adapt. For a stream processing system to be robust in the face of changing workloads and possible system faults, the architecture must have levels of flexibility and adaptivity not currently existing. The team proposes three approaches to developing the necessary flexibility.

Virtual worlds will become a platform to conduct rigorous research activities in the fields of computational astrophysics and data-intensive astronomy, seeking to determine the potential of these new technologies, as well as to develop a new set of best practices for scholarly and research activities enabled by them, and by a combination of the existing Web-based and the new VR technologies. <br\/><br\/>The central idea behind this project is that immersive VR and VWs are potentially transformative technologies on par with the Web itself, which can and should be used for serious purposes, including science and scholarship. By conveying this idea to professional scientists and scholars, and by leading by example, the project aims to engage a much broader segment of the academic community in utilizing, and developing further these technologies.

The size and complexity of these new types of data pose great challenges for experimental and computational biologists alike. Addressing these challenges has been a primary focus of much research under the umbrella term of systems biology. However, almost no work has been done on providing tools for simultaneous evolutionary analysis of genomic and interactomic data. This project will delineate the signi&#64257;cant impact such a simultaneous analysis can have on understanding and analyzing biological interaction networks, and will explore new methodologies for conducting computational analyses.

Coalescent theory has been one of the central models for establishing the relationships among gene genealogies and species phylogenies. In its current form this theory neither allows for modeling events that arise in genomic studies, such as gene duplication and loss, nor has it been used to explain interaction network evolution.

Today, congestion wastes about 40 percent of travel time on average, unnecessarily consumes about 2.3 billion gallons of fuel annually, and adversely affects the envioronment. These critical issues of transportation are not only collecting a high toll on the economy, they are also changing the way that people live, travel, and work.

Cognitive, software-defined radios are able to adjust link and network resources in order to optimize communications performance. However, high rate, robust communications is often just one of many possible network objectives. For example, in sensing applications, the goal is to maximize coverage, detect important events with high probability, and track objects of interest with high accuracy. These goals are often at odds with those for optimum communications; improved coverage requires more widely dispersed sensors, complicating network connectivity. High resolution sensing requires more bits of information, which in turn place a strain on network throughput. Power devoted to routing or packet forwarding reduces a sensors lifetime. Clearly, a different paradigm is needed when sensing performance is the critical factor, or perhaps most interestingly, when both communications and sensing performance must be considered in tandem. This research effort introduces Cognitive Sensing as a concept dual to that of cognitive communications, and investigates the competing objectives of sensing and communications networks. A cognitive sensor would adaptively adjust its operating parameters in response to the environment it finds itself in so as to optimize sensing performance, or perhaps a dual performance metric that includes both sensing and communications functions. Parameters relevant to sensing performance could include sensor position, speed and heading, antenna beampattern and polarization, transmit waveform type and bandwidth, imaging camera zoom, orientation, resolution, pointing angle, etc. The question of how to allocate such sensor resources is central to this effort.","title":"CIF:Small:Physical Layer Optimization for Cognitive Sensor Networks","awardID":"0916073","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2013-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7936","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING"}}],"PIcoPI":["486561"],"PO":["564898"]},"152463":{"abstract":"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). <br\/><br\/>This research focuses on combining foundational and lightweight formal <br\/>methods to verify the safety, security, and dependability of <br\/>large-scale software systems.

A two-dimensional discrete-time polynomial model for a WDM system is formulated to account for intra-channel and inter-channel linear and nonlinear effects. Multichannel processing algorithms across time and wavelength for interference mitigation are designed and evaluated. Since nonlinear interference limits the performance of networks, constrained coding to diminish this interference is used to trade capacity for performance.

This CAREER research project will construct new foundations for many-core scale architecture analysis, modeling and optimization, including: (1) informative and scalable methods to capture architectural characteristics across many-cores and hardware components; (2) fast and accurate predictive models to forecast the complex behavior of many-core architecture substrates with widely varied configuration parameters and execution conditions; (3) hardware and software mechanisms for efficient mining of architecture characteristics at large scales; and (4) global and cooperative resource and thermal management techniques for many-core architectures. <br\/><br\/>The scalability and sustainability of future many-core processors crucially depends on efficiently and intelligently managing an increasingly large and complex hardware investment. The novel resource management techniques and architecture\/OS support will open the door for a new class of optimizations that cannot be effectively achieved using conventional methods. The integrated education and outreach plan will help the PI to educate a broad spectrum of citizens and students. This includes expanding computer architecture curriculum with new modeling and optimization techniques, interacting with teachers at minority-serving high-schools to boost students? interest in science and engineering, and collaborating with the computing industry to integrate the developed technologies into real-world processor design flow.<br\/><br\/>\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009<br\/>(Public Law 111-5).\"","title":"CAREER: New Foundations for Many-core Architecture Analysis, Modeling and Management","awardID":"0845721","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2014-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7941","name":"COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["550720"],"PO":["366560"]},"143245":{"abstract":"0830550<br\/>Gu, Xianfeng<br\/><br\/>With the solution of Poincar\u00b4e's conjecture and Thurston's geometrization conjecture, it has been proven in theory that all closed 3-manifolds can be decomposed to pieces which admit one of eight canonical geometries. Geometric structures of 3-manifolds play fundamental roles in geometry and topology. The proposal focuses on inventing practical algorithms to compute geometric structures of 3-manifolds. The geometric algorithms combine both numerical and symbolic methods to compute the canonical Riemannian metrics on discrete 3-manifolds.

The computational algorithms on shapes are based on geometric structures of 3-manifolds, either explicitly or implicitly. It is important to understand various geometric structures on 3-manifolds and to design rigorous computational framework to approximate them. The proposal focuses on computing canonical Riemannian metrics on 3-manifold using triangulations, angle structures and the volume functional. In discrete setting, Riemannian metrics are represented as edge lengths, the curvatures are represented as dihedral angles. The symmetry of volumes of tetrahedra induces special volumetric energy form. The critical points of the volume energies correspond to the desired canonical metrics. For hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the volume energy is convex. The global minimal point is unique and reachable using Newton's method. In general 3-manifolds, the volumetric energy is more complicted, there may exist topological obstructions. The proposal studies the formation of the obstructions, and designs different strategies to modify the triangulation to remove the obstruction and reach the canonical metric solutions. The geometric structure of 3-manifolds can be directly applied in comuter graphics, computer vision, geometric modeling and medical imaging and many other fields. The practical computational tool will be helpful for mathematicians and physists in studying low dimensional topology. The visualization tools will be valuable for teaching and propogating the knowledge.","title":"Collaborative Research: CCF-TF: Computing Geometric Structures of 3-Manifolds","awardID":"0830572","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2012-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":["519438"],"PO":["565157"]},"154025":{"abstract":"Project: <br\/>Sparse and Geometric Representations of Images and Multidimensional Signals<br\/><br\/><br\/>Abstract:<br\/><br\/>One of the most fundamental characteristics of natural images and multidimensional signals is the presence of geometric regularities due to smooth boundaries between smooth regions.

Using virtual simulation and a field study, this cyberinfrastructure will be tested on illustrative scenarios for adaptive management of contamination events in water distribution systems. Contamination threat management in drinking water distribution systems involves real-time characterization of the contaminant source and plume, identification of control strategies, and design of incremental data sampling schedules. This requires dynamic integration of time-varying measurements of flow, pressure and contaminant concentration with analytical modules including models to simulate the state of the system, statistical methods for adaptive sampling, and optimization methods to search for efficient control strategies. For realistic distribution systems, the analytical modules are highly compute-intensive, requiring multi-level parallel processing via computer clusters. While data often drive the analytical modules, data needs for improving the accuracy and certainty of the solutions generated by these modules dynamically change when a contamination event unfolds. Since such time-sensitive threat events require real-time responses, the computational needs must also be adaptively matched with available resources. Thus, a software system is needed to facilitate this integration via a high-performance computing architecture (e.g., the TeraGrid) such that the measurement system, the analytical modules and the computing resources can mutually adapt and steer each other.<br\/><br\/>Urban water distribution systems are vulnerable to accidental and intentional contamination incidents that could result in adverse human health and safety impacts. The pipe network in a typical municipal distribution system includes redundant flow paths to ensure service when parts of the network are unavailable, and is designed with significant storage to deliver water during daily peak demand periods. Thus, a typical network is highly interconnected and experiences significant and frequent fluctuations in flows and transport paths. These design features unintentionally enable contamination at a single point in the system to spread rapidly via different pathways through the network, unbeknown to consumers and operators. When a contamination event is detected via the first line of defense, e.g., data from a water quality surveillance sensor network and reports from consumers, the municipal authorities are faced with several critical questions as the contamination event unfolds: Where is the source of contamination? When and for how long did this contamination occur? Where additional hydraulic or water quality measurements should be taken to pinpoint the source more accurately? What is the current and near future extent of contamination? What response action, such as shutting down portions of the network, implementing hydraulic control strategies, or introducing decontaminants, should be taken to minimize the impact of the contamination event? What would be the impact on consumers by these actions? Real-time answers to such complex questions will present significant computational challenges. This project will address these challenges by developing an adaptive cyberinfrastucture that will enable real-time processing and control through dynamic integration of computational components and real-time sensor data. This system will be evaluated using contamination scenarios based on field-scale data from a large metropolitan area.","title":"Collaborative Research\/DDDAS-TMRP: An Adaptive Cyberinfrastructure for Threat Management in Urban Water Distribution Systems","awardID":"0963571","effectiveDate":"2009-07-22","expirationDate":"2010-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7581","name":"ITR-DYNAMIC DATA DRIV APP SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0703","name":"Division of CIVIL, MECHANICAL, & MANUFACT","abbr":"CMMI"},"pgm":{"id":"7481","name":"DYNAMIC DATA DRIVEN APPL SYSTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["455144"],"PO":["565176"]},"151001":{"abstract":"Proposal Title: RI: Medium: Collaborative Research: Explicit Articulatory Models of<br\/>Spoken Language, with Application to Automatic Speech<br\/>Recognition<br\/>Institution: Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago<br\/>Abstract Date: 05\/22\/09<br\/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009<br\/>(Public Law 111-5).<br\/>One of the main challenges in automatic speech recognition is variability in speaking<br\/>style, including speaking rate changes and coarticulation.

There are over two million people in the United States afflicted by such disorders, many of whom could greatly benefit from assistive devices controlled by a BCI. Over the past two years, it has been demonstrated that a non-invasive, scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI paradigm can be used by a disabled individual for long-term, reliable control of a personal computer. This BCI paradigm allows users to select from a set of symbols presented in a flashing visual matrix by classifying the resulting evoked brain responses. One of the goals of this project is to establish that the same BCI paradigm and techniques used for the aforementioned demonstration can be straightforwardly implemented to generate high-level commands for controlling a robotic manipulator in three dimensions according to user intent, and that such a BCI can provide superior dimensional control over alternative BCI techniques currently available, as well as a wider variety of practical functions for performing everyday tasks.<br\/><br\/>Electrocorticography (ECoG), electrical activity recorded directly from the surface of the brain, has been demonstrated in recent preliminary work to be another potentially viable control for a BCI. ECoG has been shown to have superior signal-to-noise ratio, and spatial and spectral characteristics, compared to EEG. But the EEG signals used at present to operate BCIs have not been characterized in ECoG. The PI believes ECoG signals can be used to improve the speed and accuracy of BCI applications, including for example control of a robotic manipulator. Thus, additional goals of this project are to characterize evoked responses obtained from ECoG, to use them as control signals to operate a simulated robotic manipulator, and to assess the level of control (speed and accuracy) between the two recording modalities and compare the results to competitive BCI techniques. Because this is a collaborative effort with the Departments of Neurology and Neurosurgery at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, the PI team will have access to a pool of ECoG grid patients from which to recruit participants for this study.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This research will make a number of contributions in the emerging field of BCI and thus will serve as a step toward providing severely disabled individuals with a new level of autonomy for communicating with others and for performing everyday tasks, which will ultimately dramatically improve their quality of life.","title":"HCC: Medium: RUI: Control of a Robotic Manipulator via a Brain-Computer Interface","awardID":"0905468","effectiveDate":"2009-07-15","expirationDate":"2010-11-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[402561,"563899","557173"],"PO":["565227"]},"152464":{"abstract":"The project seeks to develop design principles for social computing applications in which knowledge is produced by large, loosely coordinated groups of people.

The transformative component of this research is to view haptics as one of the drivers of the dialogue between the user and the robot, and to study its relation to speech and gestures through language processing methods. To adapt to each user, the interpretation of the speech, gestures and haptic signals will be performed by means of RISq (Recognition by Indexing and<br\/>Sequencing), a novel, adaptive and reliable recognition methodology.

These attacks provide a unique and time-limited opportunity to examine and understand the information processing performed by information first responders under conditions that are far from equilibrium.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual merit<br\/>Though critical to emergency response, little is known about the information processing limitations of trained informational first responders and their supporting technology during a severe, novel and unexpected disaster. Early findings suggest that exposure to terrorist attacks impairs memory performance and raises anxiety levels. This study will inform theory about the emergence of information processing limitations in such situations. The simultaneous terrorist operations at multiple sites in this incident provide an opportunity to understand the consequences of multiple streams of information on information processing in these situations.<br\/><br\/>Unlike the 9\/11 attacks in the US, the 11\/26 attacks were an ongoing, drawn out event with the situation unfolding in real time, creating unique decision-making challenges. Further, this proposal looks at information processing within police control rooms in developing countries, an under-studied area with implications for security for US citizens. The project will be completed in collaboration with police research organizations in India. Structural equation modeling will be used to analyze paths and causal relationships from the data. Analysis of variance and covariance, and t-tests would be used.<br\/><br\/>Broader impact<br\/>The broader impact of the research will be to improve society's ability to understand the impact of extreme stress and time pressure on the dimensions of performance of informational first responders. This will help in the development of organizational and technical support systems for processing front-line information to improve our ability to withstand terror attacks and other forms of severe, unexpected disasters.","title":"COLLABORATIVE- RAPID: Information processing under stress: A study of Mumbai police control room first responders during terrorist attacks of 11\/26\/08","awardID":"0926371","effectiveDate":"2009-07-15","expirationDate":"2011-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["563364"],"PO":["543481"]},"154103":{"abstract":"\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009<br\/>(Public Law 111-5).\"<br\/><br\/><br\/>A Resource-Scalable Unifying Framework for Aural Signal Coding<br\/><br\/><br\/>The objective of this project is to achieve a comprehensive, unifying framework and corresponding universal methodologies for the coding of aural signals.

Historical efforts were tailored to narrowly defined signal types and scenarios, such as linear prediction for low rate speech communication versus transform-based music coding for storage and streaming.

The objectives support closer monitoring of weather patterns and may lead to a more detailed understanding of climate change. They also impact a wider range of surveillance applications from microwave landing systems to through-wall imaging. The research program is highly interdisciplinary with signal processing as the bridge between application domains and the mathematics of sequence design.<br\/>Current hardware allows transmission of wavefields that vary across space, polarization, time and frequency and which can be changed in rapid succession. However, sensing resolution is limited, not by hardware, but by the complexity of remote image formation. This research program develops new signal design principles that enable fast and reliable active sensing with minimal receiver signal processing complexity. The basic unit of transmission is a unitary matrix of phase coded waveforms indexed by array element and by pulse repetition interval, where the polarization of constituent waveforms may vary. Golay Complementary waveforms appear as entries of these matrices. Appropriate sequencing of unitary waveform matrices in time eliminates Doppler induced range sidelobes and provides resilience to multipath without compromising the simplicity of signal processing. OFDM signaling of complementary waveforms improves performance beyond conventional matched filtering by introducing nonlinear signal processing that exchanges static sidelobes for more dynamic cross-terms. The development of a new mathematical framework based on group theory enables the systematic construction of new complementary sequences.","title":"CIF: Small: Collaborative Research: Signal Design for Low-Complexity Active Sensing","awardID":"0914915","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2013-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7939","name":"WIRELESS COMM & SIGNAL PROCESS"}}],"PIcoPI":["434205"],"PO":["564898"]},"147943":{"abstract":"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br\/><br\/>The Hope College REU program in Computer Science provides promising undergraduates with an intensive and meaningful research experience that encourages them to consider a career in computer science research.

Unfortunately, however, virtual worlds are not accessible to users who are visually impaired. In this project the PI's goal is to alleviate this deficiency by developing a virtual world interface for visually impaired users called TextSL, which is able to extract a textual representation from a virtual world that can be read with a screen reader. Users interact with TextSL by means of a command-based mechanism inspired by multi-user dungeon games. A prototype of the system that allows for a basic form of access to the popular virtual world of Second Life has shown that such an approach is feasible. But the prototype lacks two of the most important features offered by virtual worlds: the ability to create content, and the ability to interact with interactive objects. Additional problems identified by the PI's preliminary work are that less than half of the objects in Second Life have a meaningful descriptive name, which makes the majority of objects invisible to visually impaired users, and that virtual worlds contain such vast amounts of content that merely converting it somehow into a textual description may easily overwhelm the user. To address such challenges, the PI will develop a game based on the \"games-with-a-purpose\" paradigm that allows sighted users to make virtual worlds accessible to visually impaired users by labeling objects without a name, while also establishing a taxonomy of objects that can be used to provide a more usable form of feedback. He will create a new 3D object recognition algorithm based on the \"bag-of-features\" approach that takes advantage of the unique way objects are represented in Second Life, and which can efficiently and automatically recognize large numbers of objects without a name. And he will also develop techniques that are able to provide feedback on a user's environment without overwhelming the user with large amounts of information, that are able to convey textually a user's interaction with an interactive object, and that support creation of 3D objects using command or haptic based methods.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This research will increase the quality of life for the millions of people who are visually impaired, by allowing them to participate more fully in the information society. In particular, the social interaction offered by virtual worlds will benefit people who are visually impaired as well as other individuals whose disabilities often lead to both physical and social isolation. Furthermore, as virtual worlds are increasingly used as educational platforms, access for all to this technology is doubly critical. The interaction models of virtual worlds resemble those of games, so project outcomes may also provide new insights into how to make games accessible to the visually impaired.","title":"HCC-Small: TextSL: A Virtual World Interface for the Visually Impaired","awardID":"0917362","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2014-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["486609","421302"],"PO":["565227"]},"154268":{"abstract":"Abstract <br\/>The goals of this study are to explore the utility of the emerging immersive virtual reality (VR) technologies and virtual worlds (VWs) for scientific and educational uses in the framework of astrophysics and related fields.

Demonstrating the potential and the utility of these emerging technologies to the academic community at large will help engage and facilitate a broader participation of scientists and educators in these developments. <br\/><br\/>Specifically, the research will explore the following topics: (1) The uses of VWs as scientific collaboration and communication environments, ranging from individual and group discussions, to seminars and scientific conferences and workshops. (2) Novel ways of user interaction and interfacing with numerical simulations, in terms of the setup, adjustments, and interpretation of results, especially in an interactive\/collaborative setting. (3) Immersive and interactive visualization of highly complex, multi-dimensional data sets, for a direct visual exploration, data mining, and as publishable presentations in electronic media. (4) Uses of WVs as a novel, interactive educational and public outreach platform. (5) An initial exploration of the data architectures and structures for the next generation of the Web with a VR user interface, and interaction of human avatars and intelligent software agents. (6) Investigate VW developments in the non-proprietary Opensim\/Opengrid environments. <br\/><br\/>This effort will develop new modalities of scientific research and communication using new VR and VWs technologies in the domain of astrophysics but having positive impacts for comparable fields of science as well.

Moreover, cells containing identical gene sets nearly always are heterogeneous in their epigenetic states, where the effects of stochastic fluctuation of a small number of key regulators (intrinsic noise) and general fluctuation in biochemical machinery (extrinsic noise) critically affect network dynamics. Mathematical methods for tackling these processes are not yet fully developed. In this proposal advantage is taken of a novel synthetic biology approach coupled with interaction modeling by stochastic evolutionary game theory. The latter is an ideal modeling framework for noisy interacting systems where the probability distribution of component states influence one another. Two synthetic genetic networks will be designed and implemented within two separate yeast cells that are otherwise genetically identical (except at the mating type locus). Each of these two networks takes as input a common metabolite and outputs one of two fluorescent proteins that will be measured in single cells by real time imaging techniques. The two networks will be coupled to each other by mating the cells and the coupled dynamics will be monitored. The networks are designed such that they have the opportunity to both cooperate and interfere with each other. The coupling coefficients are tunable. A stochastic evolutionary game theoretic model will be devised to determine agreement with experimental results. Both the theory and experiments proposed here are high-risk: 1) Real-time dynamics of coupling of two synthetic genetic circuits in single cells have never been studied before; 2) The particular gene networks proposed here have not been studied, so there is no guarantee that the observed dynamics will reflect simulated dynamics; 3) Imaging mating cells for single cell gene expression dynamics has not yet been attempted (to our knowledge); 4) Stochastic evolutionary game theory is a relatively new area of research in mathematical sciences and its applicability to gene regulatory network dynamics is uncertain. Given these uncertainties, and given the potential for advancing a new way of thinking about biological network dynamics if the project is successful, this project is deemed suitable for an EAGER submission. Insights learned from these studies will be valuable for understanding how networks communicate in a noisy environment and how modally rational entities with stochastic behavior cooperate or compete in communication networks.","title":"Real-Time Coupling of Gene Networks in Single Cells","awardID":"0941078","effectiveDate":"2009-07-15","expirationDate":"2011-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7931","name":"COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY"}}],"PIcoPI":["551355",426203],"PO":["565223"]},"159339":{"abstract":"The 1st Sino-USA Summer School in Vision, Learning and Pattern Recognition (VLPR2009) is the first NSF-sponsored summer school in China that brings together leading American and Chinese researchers and students in the field of computer vision and machine learning for a week of educational and cultural exchange program.

In these domains, the human \"dependent\" is typically connected to multiple other human \"controllers\" (medical specialists, structural engineers, rescue operations officials, etc.) via the robot proxy for long periods of time. The literature suggests that under these circumstances the dependent will respond to the robot socially, and will become distrustful as well as cognitively confused by a robot that presents a different affect for different controllers rather than a consistent communication strategy. The PIs believe that such a robot would occupy a novel \"social medium\" position within the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) model, and would be perceived as a loyal and helpful go-between who is an advocate for the dependent rather than as a device for accomplishing the goals of the controllers. To explore this hypothesis, the PIs will make use of the Survivor Buddy, a multimedia attachment for a robot which allows trapped victims to engage in two-way video conferencing, watch news, listen to music, etc. Formative experiments will be conducted at Stanford's CHIMe lab, followed by comprehensive, high fidelity experiments at Texas A&M's Disaster City using point-of-injury care scripts developed under prior work with medical doctors and rescue professionals. The paralinguistic aspects of the associated communication strategy will couple the ongoing work by Nass in voice characteristics and mannerisms with research in affective physical mannerisms in non-anthropomorphic robots under development by Murphy; the intellectual merit of the project thus stems from its multidisciplinary merging of communications and computer science. The research will introduce the CASA spectrum of relationships as a complement to robot-centric taxonomies, and will define a new relationship where a human is highly dependent upon a medium for long durations along with a new identity of social medium, which the PIs expect will have a greater impact on integrating robots into society than autonomous social actors and tele-operation. Project outcomes will include creation of a formal and comprehensive communication strategy for HRI, which combines verbal and nonverbal affect; this will unify the theory and practice of social robots, thereby breaking the pattern of ad hoc application of affect currently seen in the robotics literature and establishing the fundamental models and paradigms for continuing basic research in HRI.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This project will ultimately help save the lives of victims of accidents, disasters, and terrorism, and will also generally improve the quality of life for \"shut-ins.\" The concept of social medium is well-matched to the current capabilities of tele-operation and semi-autonomy in civilian and military robotics; thus, the communication strategies developed will be immediately applicable to domains such as law enforcement and emergency response, which currently use robots, as well as to healthcare, where robots have not yet found a strong economic niche but have huge economic potential.

In particular, the PI will extend her prior results on efficient, interactive algorithms for qualitatively and quantitatively accurate interactive lighting simulation, to develop a \"plug in\" for global illumination and visualization that can be seamlessly incorporated into the early stages of design and that will work directly with meshes produced by commonly-used modeling programs. The new tool will be intended for use on a standard desktop computer by an experienced designer, who need not be an expert in daylighting technology or advanced graphical simulations. The PI will also develop, as a companion system, a full-scale, immersive environment in which multiple architectural designers, a designer and a client, or a teacher and student(s) can gather to experience animated visualizations of the natural illumination within a proposed design by controlling the time of day, the season, and the climate. Participants will also be able to interactively redesign the space, by changing the geometry and materials.

Though individual components are often reusable, code that manages interactions between components seldom is. Such code is large-scale itself, and encodes significant amounts of application logic. A potential for communication between components, typically effected by message passing between objects, forms incidental structures in a program. Though such structures are real data structures, they lack an explicit representation in program code and at run time, and are thus difficult to reuse, manipulate programmatically, and reason about. This project focuses on identifying incidental structures that arise in important domains of mainstream programming---human interfaces in particular---and modeling them as declaratively specified explicit software artifacts.

This is an example of Tactual Stereognosis (TS), the ability of people to identify familiar items using touch alone. It is commonplace and uneventful. Yet no programmable haptic interface has ever been developed that would allow people to identify virtual objects using what might be termed Virtual Tactual Stereognosis (VTS). Creating such an interface is a long-range goal of the PIs. VTS has long been out of reach because it depends on active touch, multi-finger interaction, and bare fingertips, which are all difficult to achieve with existing display technology. The PIs' recent research has led to a new class of prototype devices (xPaDs), which address each of these limitations. These devices use friction modulation to control forces between the fingertip and a flat plate. The basic TPaD (Tactile Pattern Display) can create effects such as virtual textures, virtual bumps and holes, and more. More advanced versions such as the ShiverPad and SwirlPad synchronize in-plane vibrations to friction levels in order to generate active pushing forces on the fingertip. It is possible to generate many additional effects with these devices, including virtual edges that can be traced with the fingertip. The xPaD devices thus appear to be well suited to VTS. They are active touch devices that work with bare fingertips (in other words, the xPaD is fixed and the finger slides over it). Moreover, they are very compact, potentially enabling multiple panels to be arrayed over the surface of an object in order to support a multi-finger interface. In this study the PIs will begin exploration of a multi-xPaD interface, by performing experiments on an interface consisting of two opposing ShiverPads with subjects employing a pinch grip (that is, index finger on one ShiverPaD, and thumb on the other), in order to demonstrate \"binding,\" the perceptual fusion of the finger and thumb percepts into an integrated object representation.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Virtual Tactual Stereognosis is an important goal for many reasons. Graphical displays have become an important form of interface in venues ranging from the living room, to the office, to the car, to any place that a person may be. Yet as graphical displays grow more prevalent, natural touch interactions seemingly grow more obsolete. VTS aims to achieve the opposite, to empower future interfaces with sophisticated tactual capabilities that engage perceptual as well as sensory mechanisms in the hand and brain. Imagine a doctor able to simultaneously look at and palpate tissue within the body, a pregnant mother able to caress the ultrasound image of her unborn child, an autistic child able to cooperate with an animated character in a construction task, or a driver able to reach out, find and operate touch screen controls without taking his\/her eyes off the road. VTS would be an enabler for new types of electronic displays for the blind. And it would be a powerful new tool to extend our basic knowledge of haptic perception as it occurs naturally.","title":"EAGER: Preliminary Investigation of Virtual Tactual Stereognosis","awardID":"0941581","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2011-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["541975","541976"],"PO":["565227"]},"148989":{"abstract":"Sound Internet research requires comprehensive network measurements.

This extension reduces off-network traffic through biased peer selection using a lightweight approach based on reusing network information from commercial CDNs, and it has been shown to be highly effective in the wild. In addition to biasing peer selection, the extension allows subscribing volunteers to participate in a monitoring service for the Internet. With over 260,000 volunteer users today (a current growth rate of 200 per day), and distributed in over 150 countries and more than 3000 networks, this system is already the largest-ever monitoring service. On a daily basis, the growing collection of users allow the researcher to record over 100, 000, 000 transfer-rate samples, 1.8 million traceroutes, to over 3.5 million peers spread over 18, 000 ASs. <br\/><br\/>While there are clearly a large number of important research questions that could be answered based on this dataset, the task of collecting, archiving and analyzing this volume of data is a constant challenge. On a single day, we must handle over 7GB of uncompressed data! To address this challenge, the PI will build the P2P Monitoring System, a platform for data collection, archival and off-line analysis of the passively collected network- and application-level traces collected by the participating hosts. The end goals are (a) to reduce the effort currently dedicated to logistical issues related to the management of this data set in order to focus on exploring the many research paths opened by it and (b) to make possible the sharing and long-term archival of this valuable dataset with the wider community through well-established organizations such as CAIDA. <br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: The framework will enable a wide range of research activities, including: (i) explore a new approach to the design and implementation of large-scale distributed systems based on the reuse of previously gathered measurements, (ii) understand the feasibility of a network early warning system that relies exclusively on information passively gathered from P2P systems, (iii) evaluate the evolution and stability of the social network formed by P2P users, (iv) explore the potential for revealing a more complete Internet connectivity graph through the contribution of hundreds of thousands of vantage points worldwide and (v) investigate approaches to diagnose and enhance the resilience of network to natural disasters. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: Access to end-host views of the network is key to the understanding and characterization of the underlying network and to addressing the needs of new emergent Internet services and applications. The framework developed under this project will free researchers from logistical concerns related to the collection and processing of this collected view, allowing them instead to focus on exploring some of the promising research paths opened by it. The availability of this framework and dataset will also help to significantly enhance education at Northwestern through student training and curriculum enhancement. The availability of high-quality measurements is often key to the success of most research efforts. To open the field of sound, measurement-based research to the broader research community, we will continue an ongoing conversation with CAIDA exploring approaches to facilitate the sharing of this dataset and ensure its long-term archival.","title":"II-NEW: Sharing The Perspective of Ten Million Peers","awardID":"0855253","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2012-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7359","name":"COMPUTING RES INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["518224"],"PO":["565090"]},"146459":{"abstract":"Multi-core processing platforms have an increasingly broad range of applications. From consumer multimedia to image processing to defense applications, new designs containing large numbers of embedded cores are emerging. Network-on-Chip (NoC) has emerged as an enabling technology to integrate large numbers of embedded cores in a single die. In spite of all its advantages, a serious performance limitation in a traditional NoC arises from its planar metal interconnect-based multi-hop communication, wherein the data transfer between two distant blocks gives rise to high latency and energy dissipation. These problems can be simultaneously resolved if all or some of the wired links in a NoC are replaced by high-bandwidth single-hop wireless channels. Moreover, wireless links will alleviate the problem of wire congestion in NoCs.<br\/><br\/>Recent research has uncovered excellent emission and absorption characteristics leading to antenna-like behavior in carbon nanotubes (CNTs). This opens up new opportunities for detailed investigations regarding the possibility of building a wireless NoC (WiNoC) with CNT antennas and subsequently making the WiNoC robust against performance uncertainties inherent in nanodevices. The CAREER proposal?s overall research objective will be attained by pursuing two specific goals: 1) Establish design trade-offs and evaluate performance of WiNoC architectures; the proposed WiNoC has the capability to outperform corresponding wireline architectures; 2) Apply error control codes to make the WiNoC robust against possible malfunctions; by incorporating efficient channel coding schemes, the WiNoC will be made robust against varied types of malfunctions. The research proposed here is significant, as it addresses the on-chip interconnect problem from a fundamentally new perspective, namely by developing a wireless network at the nanoscale, as opposed to pursuing incremental improvements of relatively traditional methods of wire-line interconnection.

This ability is compromised in neurological disorders such as Parkinson?s disease and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The PI's long term goal is to build computer-based interactive, agent based systems for remediation of poor affect communication and diagnosis of the underlying neurological disorders based on analysis of affective signals. A requirement for such systems is technology to detect atypical patterns in affective signals. The objective of this project is to develop that technology. Toward that end the PI will develop a play situation for eliciting affect, will collect audio-visual data from approximately 60 children between the ages of 4-7 years old, half of them with ASD and the other half constituting a control group of typically developing children. The PI will label the data on relevant affective dimensions, will develop algorithms for the analysis of affective incongruity, and will then test the algorithms against the labeled data in order to determine their ability to differentiate between ASD and typical development. While automatic methods for cross-modal recognition of discrete affect classes already have yielded promising results, automatic detection and quantification of atypical patterns in affective signals, and the ability to do so in semi-natural interactive situations, is unexplored territory. The PI expects this research will lead to new methods for affect recognition based on facial affective features (with special emphasis on facial frontalization algorithms and on modeling of facial expressive dynamics), vocal affective features, and lexical affective features, as well as to new methods for automated measurement of cross-modal affective incongruity.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The expression of affect in special populations is a largely neglected area in affective computing and robotics; yet, these populations may be among the most important beneficiaries of these technologies. Affective expression impairments afflict many individuals, including those with neuro-developmental disorders such as autism, and those with neuro-degenerative disorders such as Parkinson?s disease. Because these impairments concern a core aspect of human communication and, hence, may cause profound social isolation in these individuals, intervention is highly desirable. However, one-on-one intervention by therapists, if effective, would be available only to relatively few individuals, thereby making computer-based intervention critical for broader access to such treatment. Accurate processing of the affective signal will be of use as a research and diagnostic tool for a range of neurological disorders. The CSLU research team will continue its tradition of disseminating research findings and technology, including speech corpora and software, to the research community.","title":"HCC: Medium: Automatic detection of atypical patterns in cross-modal affect","awardID":"0905095","effectiveDate":"2009-07-15","expirationDate":"2013-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["456647",402216,"438631","483791",402219],"PO":["565227"]},"149308":{"abstract":"This research will explore how concept-oriented design - a methodology for the design and development of complex 3D user interfaces - can be utilized in Lunar Quest, a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) designed to support learning of physics concepts.

The algorithms therefore satisfy the \"downward refinement property,\" resolving a problem that has been open for over 30 years at the heart of AI planning research. <br\/><br\/>By combining hierarchical deliberation, both offline and online, with hierarchical reinforcement learning and apprenticeship learning for low-level physical skill acquisition, the research seeks to enable dexterous human-scale robots to operate in unstructured environments such as kitchens, offices, and environments of still greater complexity. The research promises to yield a deeper understanding of, and better tools for, large-scale decision making in general, with implications in the social, governmental, corporate, and military spheres. <br\/><br\/>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).","title":"RI: Medium: Hierarchical Decision Making for Physical Agents","awardID":"0904672","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2013-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["520938",401938],"PO":["565035"]},"153742":{"abstract":"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br\/><br\/>The primary objective of this research is to formulate a framework for a new paradigm for clustering: discovering all possible non-redundant multiple clustering views from data. Typical clustering algorithms only find one clustering solution, but many real and complex data are multi-faceted by nature. Data can be interpreted in many different ways.

But computers haven't yet permeated the domain that is most intuitive and essential for their users, namely that of three-dimensional space and naturalistic human movement. In this research the PI will test the hypothesis that graded whole-body tactile feedback can help humans learn or relearn important body postures and motions. To this end, she will augment commercial human motion tracking with a suit of modular tactile actuators (tactors) that provide spatially-registered naturalistic real-time feedback on the way in which each limb segment should be moved, emulating the light touch of a physical therapist, teacher, or coach. Through collaboration with a clinical researcher the PI will focus in this project on rehabilitation for apraxic stroke patients. Our current understanding of stroke indicates that these patients cannot accurately estimate the pose of their limbs when performing purposeful movements, so the PI will augment their motion practice with continuous tactile guidance about the 3D location and magnitude of any configuration errors. Determining the efficacy of this approach will advance our knowledge of healthy vs. impaired human motor control, and will also improve our understanding of the way in which humans process certain types of tactile signals. Development of the novel modular tactor system will provide insights on the effectiveness of voice-coil tactors and the range of sensations they can create. In the course of testing the project's primary hypothesis, the PI will employ human-subject experiments to determine which system design methods best succeed at helping stroke patients recover. The project will be organized into low- and high-level thrusts, each of which will be spearheaded by a doctoral student.

While numerous studies have looked at eye motion for conventional displays, there has been very little work on stereo displays. The challenge and the opportunity for eye tracking in stereoscopic displays is that both eyes can be tracked, yielding data on gaze position on the screen and eye vergence, which affords an estimate of where the subject is fixating in three dimensional space (not just in screen space). Such data would shed light on the strategies users employ to explore and interpret information in these displays, which in turn may enable display designers to increase the effectiveness of their displays in transmitting information. This research will include technology development, perceptual experimentation, and visualization system development phases. The PI will initially devise an experimental methodology for binocular eye tracking devices, develop protocols and software, and run preliminary experiments to collect a baseline set of stereo tracking data which establish what tracking precision is possible and provide a basic understanding of how humans perform eye movements on stereo displays. Later, the focus will be on experiments exploring issues in the design of perceptually optimal visualizations on stereoscopic displays; eye tracking will illuminate how users scan such displays, providing insight into the visual strategies used to navigate, interpret, and extract information. Finally, the PI will employ what he has learned to design, construct, and evaluate an eye-tracking enhanced stereo 3D visualization system.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The potential impacts of this project are as broad as the possible application of stereoscopic displays. For example, the visualization of geographic data often requires the display of layered surfaces; studies have shown that when using a stereoscopic display such visualizations can be designed so that the user's perception of the shapes of two overlapping surface layers is well preserved, but we lack empirical stereo eye tracking data at present to inform and guide this design. In the medical domain, stereoscopic displays have been shown to significantly improve endoscopic performance, in terms of laparoscopic precision, of both novice and experienced surgeons, but surgeons generally need to maintain a fixed viewing position in order to maintain stereoscopic integrity, a problem which could be alleviated by measuring positional and vergence eye movements and using them to dynamically adjust the location of the autostereoscopic \"sweet spot.\" This work will contribute to building a perceptual science underlying stereoscopic display technology, which will be critical to its continuing perfection and application in domains such as science, education and training, healthcare, industry, and consumer products.","title":"HCC: Small: Eye Movement in Stereoscopic Displays, Implications for Visualization","awardID":"0915085","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2013-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["515569",408667],"PO":["565227"]},"153445":{"abstract":"CIF: Small: Digital Mitigation of Spurious Tones in Fractional-N PLLs<br\/><br\/>Fractional-N phase locked loops (PLLs) are critical components in most modern wireless communication systems including cellular telephones and wireless local area networks. Unfortunately, the error introduced by conventional PLLs contains period disturbances referred to as spurious tones, which only can be suppressed sufficiently for typical wireless applications with techniques that increase power consumption and cost. Furthermore, these techniques become less effective as integrated circuit (IC) technology continues to scale to smaller dimensions. Therefore, the spurious tone problem negatively affects power consumption, cost, and manufacturability of wireless communication systems, and the problem gets worse as IC technology scales with Moore?s Law.<br\/>The \u00c4\u00d3 modulator in a conventional PLL is the fundamental cause of spurious tones. The spurious tones are induced when the \u00c4\u00d3 modulator?s quantization noise is subjected to nonlinearity from non-ideal circuit behavior in the PLL. The goal of this research is to develop a \u00c4\u00d3 modulator replacement, called a successive requantizer, that avoids this problem. The successive requantizer has a different principle of operation than a \u00c4\u00d3 modulator and its quantization noise is much less susceptible to nonlinearity-induced spurious tones. The research tasks are 1) to further develop the theory underlying successive requantizers to improve their performance, 2) to investigate how PLLs can be optimized at the circuit level to take advantage of the reduced sensitivity to nonlinear distortion offered by successive requantizers, and 3) to develop a proof-of-concept fractional-N PLL IC enabled by the theoretical results of the project that is compliant with a demanding wireless standard such as IEEE 802.16 and exceeds the present state of the art in terms of minimizing power consumption and circuit area.","title":"CIF: Small: Digital Mitigation of Spurious Tones in Fractional-N PLLs","awardID":"0914748","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2013-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7936","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING"}}],"PIcoPI":["560228"],"PO":["564898"]},"153566":{"abstract":"This project aims at developing mathematical models to describe the dynamics of large populations of interacting strategic agents.

This work proposes novel computational models and interactive interfaces, and focuses on whole-body demonstrative gestures for interactive training and assistance applications with autonomous virtual humans. <br\/><br\/>Although gesture modeling has made substantial advances in recent years, less attention has been given to parameterized demonstrative gestures which can be modified to refer to arbitrary locations in the environment. This particular class of gestures is critical for a number of applications. Typical examples of such gestures include pointing to and demonstrating how to operate particular devices or objects. To ensure the system's effectiveness, this project includes cognitive studies for guiding the development of the computational gesture model. To ensure the achievement of realistic results, motion capture data obtained from real performers executing gestures for demonstration tasks within real scenarios will be employed.

The approach constitutes a substantial step toward achieving autonomous virtual assistants which can meaningfully and effectively demonstrate tasks and procedures.

By adding a bit of redundancy to data, and using sophisticated mathematical algorithms to encode and decode, errors in the system can be reduced to an arbitrarily low threshold. This project concerns algebraic geometry (AG) codes, a large and powerful family of codes that includes Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, which are the standard code used in commercial products today. The standard decoding algorithm for Reed-Solomon codes is the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm, which decodes up to the sphere-packing bound. In the 1980's and 1990's, AG codes were discovered that yielded better error correction performance than RS codes, and efficient algorithms generalizing Berlekamp-Massey were developed.

In these domains, the human \"dependent\" is typically connected to multiple other human \"controllers\" (medical specialists, structural engineers, rescue operations officials, etc.) via the robot proxy for long periods of time. The literature suggests that under these circumstances the dependent will respond to the robot socially, and will become distrustful as well as cognitively confused by a robot that presents a different affect for different controllers rather than a consistent communication strategy. The PIs believe that such a robot would occupy a novel \"social medium\" position within the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) model, and would be perceived as a loyal and helpful go-between who is an advocate for the dependent rather than as a device for accomplishing the goals of the controllers. To explore this hypothesis, the PIs will make use of the Survivor Buddy, a multimedia attachment for a robot which allows trapped victims to engage in two-way video conferencing, watch news, listen to music, etc. Formative experiments will be conducted at Stanford's CHIMe lab, followed by comprehensive, high fidelity experiments at Texas A&M's Disaster City using point-of-injury care scripts developed under prior work with medical doctors and rescue professionals. The paralinguistic aspects of the associated communication strategy will couple the ongoing work by Nass in voice characteristics and mannerisms with research in affective physical mannerisms in non-anthropomorphic robots under development by Murphy; the intellectual merit of the project thus stems from its multidisciplinary merging of communications and computer science. The research will introduce the CASA spectrum of relationships as a complement to robot-centric taxonomies, and will define a new relationship where a human is highly dependent upon a medium for long durations along with a new identity of social medium, which the PIs expect will have a greater impact on integrating robots into society than autonomous social actors and tele-operation. Project outcomes will include creation of a formal and comprehensive communication strategy for HRI, which combines verbal and nonverbal affect; this will unify the theory and practice of social robots, thereby breaking the pattern of ad hoc application of affect currently seen in the robotics literature and establishing the fundamental models and paradigms for continuing basic research in HRI.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This project will ultimately help save the lives of victims of accidents, disasters, and terrorism, and will also generally improve the quality of life for \"shut-ins.\" The concept of social medium is well-matched to the current capabilities of tele-operation and semi-autonomy in civilian and military robotics; thus, the communication strategies developed will be immediately applicable to domains such as law enforcement and emergency response, which currently use robots, as well as to healthcare, where robots have not yet found a strong economic niche but have huge economic potential.

Due to quadratic dependence of power on voltage, supply voltage scaling has been investigated as an effective method to reduce power. However, supply scaling increases the delays in all computation paths and can result in incorrect or incomplete computation of certain paths. Besides power dissipation, process variations also pose a major design concern with technology scaling. Supply voltage can be scaled-up or logic gates can be up-sized to prevent delay failures and to achieve higher parametric yield. However, such techniques come at the cost of increased power and\/or die area. Meeting the contradictory requirements of high yield, low power and high quality are becoming exceedingly challenging in nanometer designs. Hence, there is a need for a scalable design methodology in which minimal output quality degradation is achieved under changing power constraints and process conditions. In addition, for a prescribed power consumption level and process, design methodology must take into account the effects of input signal noise and distortion on the fidelity of the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) computation and ensure that graceful output quality degradation is achieved under varying degrees of noise and distortion through proper algorithm and hardware design. <br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/> The research involves development of a systematic methodology for reorganizing (transforming) algorithmic level computations, data and underlying hardware in such a way that minimum performance degradation in DSP systems is achieved under reduced power supply, increased process variations and reduced input signal quality. It has been observed that for DSP applications\/systems, all computations are not equally important in shaping the output response. This information is exploited by the investigators to develop suitable algorithms\/architectures that provide the ?right? trade-offs between output quality vs. energy consumption (supply scaling) vs. parametric yield due to process variations vs. input signal noise. To address resilience to process variations, the investigators identify the significant\/not-so-significant components of such systems based on output sensitivities. Under such a scenario, with scaled supply voltage and\/or parameter variations, if there are potential delay failures in some paths, only the less-significant computations are affected. In other words, using carefully designed algorithms and architectures, the investigators provide unequal error protection (under voltage over-scaling) to significant\/not-so-significant computation elements, thereby achieving large improvements in power dissipation with graceful degradation in output signal quality.","title":"SHF: Small: Collaborative Research: Imperfection-Resilient Scalable Digital Signal Processing Algorithms and Architectures Using Significance Driven Computation","awardID":"0916926","effectiveDate":"2009-07-15","expirationDate":"2013-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7936","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING"}}],"PIcoPI":["551012"],"PO":["564898"]},"148958":{"abstract":"The purpose of this project is to create an internet-accessible testbed to support research and education in advanced network systems. It builds upon and leverages an existing community resource, the Open Network Lab (www.onl.wustl.edu), adding high performance components that can be configured and extended to support a wide range of experimental projects. The project takes advantage of new low cost 10 gigabit Ethernet switching technology, dual quad-core servers and programmable Network Interface Cards (NICs) with multicore network processors. The project requires extensions to the ONL control and management software, the development of software modules for the programmable NICs and a number of extensions to the existing testbed to make it more suitable for clean slate networking research. Effective experimental testbeds are essential for high quality systems research in networking. This is particularly true during the current period of transition in which networking research finds itself. The concepts of overlay hosting and network virtualization developed and demonstrated in research systems, are now showing up in large, commercial data centers. So-called utility computing or cloud computing has emerged as an important delivery vehicle for web-based services. As cloud computing is used for more communication-intensive applications, we can expect to see a growing need for more dynamic and application-oriented networking elements within the cloud infrastructure. There is increasing innovation in layer 2 networking technology, leading to local and metropolitan area networks that exploit commodity Ethernet switches, while moving beyond the limitations that have traditionally constrained Ethernet to the LAN environment. The research community is focused on clean slate network ideas that put aside the constraints of legacy network technologies to develop a better understanding of what might be possible.

The testbed also makes researchers more productive, by providing the necessary tools and infrastructure to allow them to focus on the innovative elements of their research ideas, freeing them from many of the more mundane tasks that typically have to be done before the more interesting issues can be addressed. <br\/><br\/>The Broader Impact of the program will be felt in several ways.

Students who have meaningful laboratory experiences can make a more direct connection between networking concepts and actual network operation, allowing them to learn faster and become more productive.

The growing impact of globalization on the world economy makes it essential for the United States to continue to play a leadership role in the development of new networking technology.

Several algorithms have been developed to model the movement of animal flocks. These investigations are proving useful in modeling and understanding complex phenomena and in developing applications in areas ranging from biology to nanotechnology.

The nodes cooperate with each other through local interactions and adapt their states, and the network topology, in response to data collected at the nodes and data received from their neighbors. Information arriving at a node propagates throughout the network by means of a diffusive process. The diffusion of information results in a form of collective intelligence as is evidenced by improved learning and convergence behavior relative to non-cooperative networks. A closer study of the dynamics of swarm behavior and adaptive networks can suggest alternative techniques for designing adaptive networks and for understanding flock behavior, with potential impact on the applications that can be motivated from these developments.","title":"CIF: SMALL: Explorations and Insights into Adaptive Networks, Animal Flocking Behavior, and Swarm Intelligence","awardID":"0942936","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2012-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7936","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING"}}],"PIcoPI":["448637"],"PO":["564898"]},"150960":{"abstract":"The ubiquity of wireless devices and services and the ever increasing bandwidth demand make it imperative to improve spectrum utilization.

In fact, uncertainty can play a key role successful information<br\/>integration.<br\/><br\/>3) The system relies on general-purpose entity-resolution as a<br\/>fundamental building block of the integration process and the<br\/>integrated information. Furthermore, the system retains both the<br\/>uncertainty and the lineage associated with the entity-resolution<br\/>process.<br\/><br\/>4) The system incorporates powerful lineage capabilities, tracking<br\/>where, when, and how data was produced, how it has evolved over time,<br\/>and how it has been combined and manipulated as part of the<br\/>integration process.

Research and Education Proposal Linear Gaussian models on large data sets computation is characterized by heavy matrix manipulation and iterative methods with slow convergence. Efficiency issues become worse considering the fact that large data sets are stored and retrieved from disk and that in a database system models are manipulated on disk as well. Despite their importance there is scarce research work that attempts to adapt this big family of Gaussian models exploiting database systems techniques. This proposal studies how to improve algorithms for linear Gaussian models to analyze large, high dimensional, data sets, manipulating matrices on secondary storage (i.e. disk), using a small amount of primary storage (i.e. RAM memory). The models studied herein include maximum likelihood factor analysis for dimensionality reduction and mixtures of Gaussian distributions to perform clustering.<br\/><br\/>The educational component of this proposal involves two main activities.

The second activity involves enhancing current research and teaching of data mining at the University of Houston.<br\/><br\/>2. Intellectual Merit<br\/>This research project requires the discovery of common algorithmic principles to perform incremental matrix computations for a family of statistical models, understanding how to summarize large data sets, preserving their statistical properties required by multiple models and proposing new database techniques tailored for such models, capable of performing efficient matrix manipulation on secondary storage. Incremental computations are difficult to attain because methods for linear Gaussian models require iterations on the entire data set. Summarization requires transforming complex matrix equations considering high dimensionality, large data set size and numerical stability, preserving model accuracy. Developing matrix optimizations combining primary and secondary storage is quite different from optimizing a matrix algorithm that works only on primary storage.<br\/><br\/>This research work requires mathematical knowledge to generalize, optimize and transform the computation of linear Gaussian models. On the other hand, it needs database systems expertise on how to organize and index diverse matrices on secondary storage for efficient reading and writing.<br\/><br\/>3.

As scripting languages have become more popular, especially with new programmers, long-term development and maintenance problems affect a growing body of programs at many layer of our computing infrastructure. This project is about smoothing the path from scripts to a more rigorous style of programming by introducing type systems into scripting languages. A type system can offer up-front guarantees about how a program will execute, and it can help isolate the effects of program modifications. Rather than imposing a particular type system, however, this project's goal is to explore a particular way of defining and customizing a type system while introducing it gradually into an existing program. The specific technical approach in this project builds on Lisp-style macros as provided by the PLT Scheme programming language.","title":"SHF: Small: An Extensible Gradual Type System via Compile-Time Meta-Programming","awardID":"0914759","effectiveDate":"2009-07-15","expirationDate":"2013-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7943","name":"PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES"}}],"PIcoPI":["518130"],"PO":["564588"]},"154108":{"abstract":"Computation and communication are physical processes with limits set by the laws of physics.

Two questions are specifically addressed, one concerning the amount of noise that can be tolerated in a quantum computer, and the other about the minimal physical resources required to store quantum information. <br\/><br\/>Noise Thresholds: When talking about circuits to implement quantum algorithms one has to take into account the fact that it is impossible to implement the gates perfectly. In the case of quantum computation this realization is especially relevant as the experimental challenges for implementing quantum gates are significantly greater than those for implementing classical gates. <br\/>It is the theory of fault tolerant quantum computation that investigates the many aspects of this issue. The current project looks at exactly which noise levels the ability to perform quantum computation disappears and how such threshold values depend on the kind of quantum gate and the kind of noise.<br\/><br\/>Information Storage: It seems obvious that to store a bit of information one needs to expend physical resources and that there is a trade-off between these resources such as space and energy.

The traditional connection-based model is built on the premise that the underlying network is connected, and views node mobility as undesirable. The mobility-assisted model considers mobility as a desirable feature, where routing is based on the store-carry-forward paradigm with random or controlled movement of mobile nodes. This research uses node mobility to enhance routing capability in a mobile network. A dual control planes model is presented, which includes the traditional S (stationary)-plane for routing among stationary nodes using connection-based message routing. In addition, a new control plane, M (mobile)-plane, is used for trajectory control of mobile nodes. The focus is on loosely controlled movement of mobile nodes to assist routing. The five goals of this work are the following: (1) Propose a generic framework for routing. (2) Offer flexible trajectory control of mobile nodes to balance several global objectives. (3) Explore the use of unicasting as a basic building block to support collective communication, including multicast, broadcast, anycast, gather, and gossip. (4) Extend the current model in the 2-D Euclidian space to the high-dimensional and non-Euclidian space. (5) Integrate different components in dual control planes and fine tune the system through an empirical study based on a set of well-defined quantitative performance<br\/>metrics.

There is a considerable demand for high-level modeling tools, expressing the user?s intent directly while being capable of handling complex models robustly. Surface optimization techniques unify traditional ab initio modeling of high-quality surfaces and manipulation of existing geometric data in a single natural framework by specifying suitable optimization functionals governing the surface behavior. This framework is conceptually representation-independent: the surface can be approximated by spline patches, subdivision surfaces, meshes or in implicit form.

Designers prototype because \"enlightened trial and error outperforms the planning of flawless intellects\" (David Kelley). While a few leading-edge endeavors have shown the value of prototyping and learning from alternatives, these design successes have been resource-intensive or in niche contexts. Attempts to reach a broader audience have stumbled because they were heavyweight, bespoke, or against the grain of important design practices and values. Consequently, most interfaces today are launched with minimal understanding of alternative design choices and their relative efficacy. In this project the PI will explore, evaluate, and disseminate the techniques necessary to make enlightened trial and error a cornerstone of user interface design. To these ends, the project's technical and empirical research comprises three thrusts which will unearth fundamental principles and evaluate them through software tools that leverage web services<br\/><br\/>Creating Designs Analogically. Programming with traditional API documentation as the sole resource has the same difficulty as creating a meal with only a grocery list. The elements are all there, but none of the context necessary for composing a coherent and complete whole. The PI hypothesizes that tools specifically designed for creation by example modification would look quite different than current tools and yield significantly higher-quality results. The PI will carry out a systematic exploration of the design space for design-by-example tools to identify major design decisions and tradeoffs, and provide a performance and complexity comparison of important design points.<br\/><br\/>Exploring Alternatives Parametrically. Prototyping's concreteness benefit can also be its Achilles heel when it encourages premature commitment. To address this, the PI envisions parametric interfaces, a representation with lightweight semantic structure for fast and broad design space exploration. Design stakeholders and lead users lacking the time or expertise to design interfaces would be able to parameterize and rapidly iterate them, thereby shifting the designers' responsibility from creating a specific artifact to creating a context for participation. The PI's initial research suggests that parametric tools increase both broad exploration and fine-grained tuning. An additional benefit is that parametric interfaces would facilitate appropriate adaptation to user abilities and device characteristics.<br\/><br\/>Designing Pervasive Interactions. How can tools enable the rapid exploration and evaluation of new interactions that combine ubiquitous computing and web services? Such interactions would allow designers to leverage information repositories and data transformation (through web services), while engaging the user in the world instead of in front of the desktop (through ubicomp). While software has almost always been built with the assistance of toolkits and libraries, few software tools have deeply embraced this reality and leveraged it. The PI plans to create tools for designers to work opportunistically by foraging for and combining pre-existing, high-level blocks of functionality.<br\/><br\/>In each of the technical thrusts, the PI will conduct both quantitative and qualitative evaluation comparing the quality of designs produced with and without the technique, as measured by independent raters, and he will also conduct longer-term case studies for a more ecologically valid understanding of their use. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Design has emerged as a critical engine of innovation in today's multi-billion-dollar information technology industry. The software tools resulting from this project will contribute a conceptual understanding of how to most effectively create, manage, and learn from prototypes by leveraging web services, which are widespread yet still evolving. To enable ubiquitous access to enlightened prototyping, all of the software and course materials the PI has created and will create at Stanford are open source and available online. The PI will also serve as an advisor to the Stanford?s K-12 Learning Lab, which is bringing design thinking into public schools.","title":"CAREER: Designing for Enlightened Trial and Error","awardID":"0846167","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2014-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[390884],"PO":["565227"]},"150721":{"abstract":"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).

Internet traffic, speech signals, and biological signals, are a few such examples. Choosing a random process to model such phenomena involves a tradeoff between accuracy versus complexity. This project investigates fast computational methods for modeling random phenomena using a class of versatile random processes called randomly modulated processes. A randomly modulated process consists of two simpler random processes, one which is observable and another which modulates the observable process. By exploiting the structural properties of randomly modulated processes, the investigators are devising efficient and accurate methods to model a wide class of random phenomena. Specifically, the project develops recursive estimators to characterize Internet traffic accurately in real-time. Other important applications of the estimators can be found in speech processing, nuclear medicine, biology, genetics, and finance.<br\/><br\/>The project focuses on the intertwined problems of signal and parameter estimation of randomly modulated processes.

The project also involves the derivation of asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimators for randomly modulated processes.

Milstein<br\/> Abstract<br\/>In today?s communications environment, it is important to have rich media content (images, audio, video) that can scale up or down depending on availability of resources. In quality scalable multimedia, some portions of a bit stream contain information that allows a moderate quality reconstruction of the image or video, and additional portions of the bit stream allow the source to be reconstructed at progressively higher quality. We consider the transmission of scalable multimedia data (image and video) through variable types of channels, with a focus on providing different levels of unequal error protection (UEP) appropriate for different levels of information importance and suitable for the channel conditions. <br\/>There are many techniques for providing protection against errors, including forward error protection (FEC), hierarchical modulation, and leaky and partial prediction in video coding. Our research involves two new techniques for combining hierarchical modulation with either image or video to produce enhanced performance. We consider a MIMO-based technique, in which MIMO space-time coding is used to increase reliability for the most important information in the scalable image or video data, whereas MIMO spatial multiplexing is used to increase data rate for the less important information. This is combined and optimized with existing techniques where unequal error protection is achieved by transmitting different power levels on multiple antennas. The hierarchical approaches for UEP, as well as the MIMO techniques for UEP, are considered in conjunction with FEC and with leaky\/partial prediction mechanisms for scalable video. We also consider UEP for cooperative communications, where a virtual MIMO array is formed out of cooperating nodes. Lastly, we investigate the effects of delay considerations in UEP.","title":"CIF: Small: Scalable Multimedia with Unequal Error Protection","awardID":"0915727","effectiveDate":"2009-07-15","expirationDate":"2013-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7936","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING"}}],"PIcoPI":["507609","507610"],"PO":["564898"]},"153823":{"abstract":"One of the central goals of quantum information theory is to understand quantum systems from the standpoint of computational complexity.

To capture the tunnels, handles, and voids of a volume, homology and cohomology groups need to be computed; to describe the tangling, twisting, and linking patterns among the handles, tunnels, and voids, fundamental groups need to be computed as well.

This finding is especially crucial for highly congested multi-hop wireless networks that are characterized by frequent failures, e.g. ad hoc and sensor networks. Since the retransmission-based failure recovery is at the core of the existing networks, this new phenomenon sets the basis for many more discoveries in this domain along the vertical (protocol stack), temporal and spatial network dimensions. Furthermore, this research also investigates how widely deployed fair resource sharing mechanisms come with a price since they may be responsible for spreading the long-tailed delays to the entire network. Finally, based on the critical study of the exiting protocols, the investigator pursues careful redesign of network protocols that are shown to cause or spread long delays and instabilities.

Models of the articulators<br\/>(such as the lips and tongue) can succinctly represent much of this variability. Most<br\/>previous work on articulatory models has focused on the relationship between acoustics<br\/>and articulation, but more significant improvements require models of the hidden<br\/>articulatory state structure. This work has both a technological goal of improving<br\/>recognition and a scientific goal of better understanding articulatory phenomena.<br\/>The project considers larger model classes than previously studied. In particular, the<br\/>project develops graphical models, including dynamic Bayesian networks and<br\/>conditional random fields, designed to take advantage of articulatory knowledge. A new<br\/>framework for hybrid directed and undirected graphical models is being developed, in<br\/>recognition of the benefits of both directed and undirected models, and of both<br\/>generative and discriminative training. The project activities include major extension of<br\/>earlier articulatory models with context modeling, asynchrony structures, and<br\/>specialized training; development of factored conditional random field models of<br\/>articulatory variables; and discriminative training to alleviate word confusability.<br\/>The scientific goal addresses questions about the ways in which articulatory trajectories<br\/>vary in different contexts. Existing databases are used, and initial work in manual<br\/>articulatory annotation is being extended. In addition, the project uses articulatory<br\/>models to perform forced transcription of larger data sets, providing an additional<br\/>resource for the research community. Other broad impacts include new models and<br\/>techniques with applicability to other time-series modeling problems.

The new generation of mobile and humanoid robots still lacks basic ?hands? that can reliably grasp objects. Robot hands have been traditionally built as anthropomorphic, high degree-of-freedom (DOF) mechanisms that are expensive and difficult to control. The research team is developing technologies based on defining hand mechanisms that capture two key features of human grasping, versatility and low dimensionality of hand postures. Reducing complexity brings major benefits. Determining the minimal number of hand joints, sensors and actuators can reduce costs and speed research as low-complexity hands can be easily fabricated, designs can be quickly iterated, and control can be simplified. These ideas are used to build a low-cost, low DOF grasping device that is based on hard human grasping data. Further, the new hand designs are being tested in simulation so as to build hardware that is functionally proven for robotic grasping tasks. Important research outcomes include: development of a new low-dimensional, low-cost robotic hand; experiments to gain insights from human grasping and adaptive compliance; and machine learning algorithms for grasping. Broader impacts include: collaboration between neuroscience and robotics; hardware design methods and computational tools for hand researchers; providing robust grasping capabilities in real environments such as robots for home care and assistance for the elderly and disabled; establishing links between neural control and prosthetic devices based on dimensionality reduction; and dissemination of modeling and simulation grasping software.","title":"RI: Medium: Collaborative Research: Robotic Hands: Understanding & Implementing Adaptive Grasping","awardID":"0904514","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2013-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["518026"],"PO":["543539"]},"150900":{"abstract":"The phenomenal advance in computer technology in terms of processing<br\/>speed and capacity, closely described by Moore's law, in the last four<br\/>decades has been outpaced by the explosive amount of data that are used<br\/>to describe more realistic models in scientific computing.

Among the vast information theoretic literature, most of the results are based on the assumption that the channel inputs are Gaussian distributed. However, Gaussian inputs can never be realized in practical systems. The inputs are usually taken from finite alphabets, which can significantly depart from Gaussian distribution. A large nonlinear gap exists between the theoretical capacity and practical achievable rate. This nonlinear gap indicates that Gaussian-input assumption may not provide a realistic design guideline to practical systems. Maximizing mutual information over channels with finite alphabet inputs will benefit not only bandwidth efficiency but also bit error rate performance. However, much less work has been done for this important topic. This is mainly due to lack of closed-form solution and high computational complexity.<br\/><br\/>The project investigates the direct maximization of mutual information and throughput over multi-user channels with finite alphabet inputs. The computational complexity problem is tackled by developing mathematically tractable and practically accurate algorithms via employing graph-based message-passing techniques. Shaping matrices are introduced to the maximization of mutual information. Parameterized approaches are developed to solve optimal shaping matrices which lead to the global maxima of the mutual information. Research efforts focus on multiple access channels, broadcast channels and interference channels, which are the fundamental channel scenarios of multi-user communications. The channel state information and\/or channel covariance information are made available to the transmitter and receiver for the maximization of mutual information. Both frequency-flat fading and frequency-selective fading channels are explored.","title":"CIF: Small: Signal Processing for Multi-user Communications under Finite Alphabet Constraints","awardID":"0915846","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2013-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7936","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING"}}],"PIcoPI":["523556"],"PO":["564898"]},"153806":{"abstract":"The practical application of 3D virtual environment technology has made significant progress over the last decade, as advances in the computer industry allow for faster, more complex operations to be accomplished with much less hardware and at decreased cost. As a consequence, applications once limited to experimental laboratories are reaching the design phase for mainstream deployment. However, successful integration of 3D virtual environments into the daily activities of the full spectrum of society is hindered by the fact that such systems do not yet provide an environment in which human performance matches performance in the natural world. One of the limiting factors is the failure to properly take into account the human psychological and sensorimotor systems, and how these systems change with age. It is well known, for example, that vision is the dominant source of sensory information, and that changes in sensorimotor processing and perception result in alterations in the use of vision for motor control at various stages of the lifespan. That human-computer interaction is significantly affected by such changes where standard computer interfaces are concerned is well documented, but there is a paucity of information on human-computer interaction across the lifespan in 3D virtual environments. The PI argues that to succeed in the creation of valid 3D virtual environments for the full array of potential users, age-specific sensorimotor requirements must be systematically determined. To this end, the PI will in this project seek to establish sensory feedback parameters for motor control in a desktop 3D virtual environment. A multi-disciplinary approach based on methodologies from human motor control, biomechanics and neuroscience will be used. Specifically, the PI will investigate the quantity, quality, and timing of visual feedback employed in simple tasks. Further inquiry into the interaction of task difficulty and sensory feedback will be undertaken. Finally, for each of the basic experimental investigations, the between subjects factor of age group and the within subjects factors of manipulated sensory feedback will be analyzed. Basic motor control measurement and predictive modeling techniques will be employed to understand how sensory feedback is used, to quantify the negative effects of lag, and to develop methods for improving the presentation of sensory information to users of various age groups. These developments will then be incorporated into the system, and experiments will be extended to more complex and functional tasks. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: By gaining a comprehensive understanding of the role of graphic information for interaction in computer-generated environments across the lifespan, this research will establish evidence-based recommendations to designers of virtual environments regarding how to provide the most effective sensory feedback to users of all ages.","title":"The role of sensory information for performance in virtual environments across the lifespan","awardID":"0916119","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2014-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[409291],"PO":["565227"]},"153718":{"abstract":"\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009<br\/>(Public Law 111-5).\"<br\/><br\/>Recently, the new field of compressive sensing has emerged with the <br\/>promise to revolutionize digital processing broadly.

Due to quadratic dependence of power on voltage, supply voltage scaling has been investigated as an effective method to reduce power. However, supply scaling increases the delays in all computation paths and can result in incorrect or incomplete computation of certain paths. Besides power dissipation, process variations also pose a major design concern with technology scaling. Supply voltage can be scaled-up or logic gates can be up-sized to prevent delay failures and to achieve higher parametric yield. However, such techniques come at the cost of increased power and\/or die area. Meeting the contradictory requirements of high yield, low power and high quality are becoming exceedingly challenging in nanometer designs. Hence, there is a need for a scalable design methodology in which minimal output quality degradation is achieved under changing power constraints and process conditions. In addition, for a prescribed power consumption level and process, design methodology must take into account the effects of input signal noise and distortion on the fidelity of the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) computation and ensure that graceful output quality degradation is achieved under varying degrees of noise and distortion through proper algorithm and hardware design. <br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/> The research involves development of a systematic methodology for reorganizing (transforming) algorithmic level computations, data and underlying hardware in such a way that minimum performance degradation in DSP systems is achieved under reduced power supply, increased process variations and reduced input signal quality. It has been observed that for DSP applications\/systems, all computations are not equally important in shaping the output response. This information is exploited by the investigators to develop suitable algorithms\/architectures that provide the ?right? trade-offs between output quality vs. energy consumption (supply scaling) vs. parametric yield due to process variations vs. input signal noise. To address resilience to process variations, the investigators identify the significant\/not-so-significant components of such systems based on output sensitivities. Under such a scenario, with scaled supply voltage and\/or parameter variations, if there are potential delay failures in some paths, only the less-significant computations are affected.

Furthermore, translation of advanced STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) topics into American Sign Language (ASL) is far from standardized, and often requires discussion between students and interpreters to devise consistent signs. Better access to classroom activities and a consistent, conceptually clear signing system for STEM topics are both vitally needed in order for deaf and hard of hearing students to advance in the sciences. Thus, in this project the PI will design, implement, and evaluate two distinct yet interconnected technologies. The first of these is ClassInFocus, a classroom platform to help students access remote interpreters and captioners, avoid visual dispersion, and facilitate interaction in the classroom. ClassInFocus will utilize the existing high bandwidth internet connections at multiple universities to create more opportunity for finding the best qualified interpreter or captioner for specific STEM topics. Designing, implementing, and evaluating technological solutions that best meet the educational needs of deaf and hard of hearing students is a challenging research problem; this immersive technology that brings many different technical and human resources into the classroom in an accessible and unobtrusive way is new to the field. ASL-STEM Forum, the second thrust of this work, will be an on-line video forum to facilitate discussion about signing for STEM topics. Visual collaboration between members of the community, in this case the Deaf Community, is important to ensure natural, conceptually correct, and community approved language progression. Designing, implementing, and evaluating a cyberinfrastructure solution to facilitate discussion about ASL vocabulary and grammar for STEM content, that will eventually serve as a resource for students, teachers, and interpreters involved in ASL for STEM fields, is another challenging research problem. Using social networking techniques to engage the deaf and hard of hearing community in discussions about ASL topics and vocabulary in STEM fields is entirely new to the field. This research will involve collaboration with the National Technical Institute for the Deaf at Rochester Institute of Technology, Gallaudet University, and the Shodor Education Foundation.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The new technologies to be developed as outcomes of this research will enable deaf and hard of hearing students to better access the STEM fields by improving the learning environment and the linguistic access to STEM content. Not only does this increase the likelihood that deaf people will attain college and graduate degrees, it will increase the participation of deaf and hard of hearing people in the development and research of new technology. Other students may also benefit from this technology, as digital notes and captions provide alternative access for students with learning disabilities and create opportunities for searchable archives of class content.","title":"HCC-Small: DHH Cyber-Community - Supporting Deaf and Hard of Hearing Students in STEM Fields","awardID":"0915268","effectiveDate":"2009-07-15","expirationDate":"2014-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["523760","491887","485574"],"PO":["565227"]},"150804":{"abstract":"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br\/><br\/>A recent study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) documented over 32,000 mostly surgery-related deaths, costing nine billion dollars and accounting for 2.4 million extra days in hospital in 2000. At the same time, economic pressures influence medical schools to reduce the cost in training surgeons. The success of simulation-based surgical education and training will not only shorten the time involving a faculty surgeon in various stages of training (hence reducing cost), but also will improve the quality of training. Reviewing the state-of-the-art research, there are two research challenges: (1) to automatically rate the proficiency of a resident surgeon in simulation-based training, and (2) to associate skill ratings with correction procedures. This award will explore a machine-learning-based approach to computational understanding of surgical skills based on temporal inference of visual and motion-capture data from surgical simulation. The approach employs latent space analysis that exploits intrinsic correlations among multiple data sources of a surgical action. This learning approach is enabled by the simulation and data acquisition design that ensures clinical meaningfulness of the acquired data. <br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: <br\/>The intellectual merit of the proposed work lies in the exploration of the answers to two key research questions: (1) how to develop a computational understanding of surgical-skill-defining criteria (high-level knowledge) from low-level, raw sensory observations; and (2) how to efficiently perform temporal inference from correlated data sources of disparate nature with unknown structures. Expertise related to motion is a well-observed phenomenon but the task of inferring motion expertise patterns from captured data especially video is largely unexplored. This award presents a controlled methodology to extract expertise patterns from raw sensory data. This interdisciplinary team with collaboration from medical professionals is well positioned to address these fundamental research issues.<br\/><br\/>Broad Impact: <br\/>The broad impact of the proposed work is threefold. First, the ability of the proposed system to create descriptive, mathematical models from recorded video and other data in surgical training opens up the possibility of new paradigms that can significantly improve current practice in surgeon education and training. Second, the proposed approaches may enable development of lower-cost surgical training systems. Third, the novel formulation of and solution to the fundamental problem of expertise inference from disparate temporal measurements with intrinsic correlation can find many other applications such as sports (e.g., baseball and golf training), rehabilitation, and surveillance. The impact of the interdisciplinary project on education manifests in its direct contribution to better training and education of surgeons and to nurturing a new generation of students who possesses strong interdisciplinary background and skills. <br\/><br\/>Key Words: Surgical Simulation, Surgical Education and Training, Complementary Feature Selection, Visual and Temporal Inference, Learning in Latent Space.","title":"III: Medium: A Machine Learning Approach to Computational Understanding of Skill Criteria in Surgical Training","awardID":"0904778","effectiveDate":"2009-07-15","expirationDate":"2013-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["517806","527025","438517"],"PO":["565136"]},"150947":{"abstract":"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br\/><br\/>Interoperability of heterogeneous data is a critical problem faced by every modern enterprise that is concerned with data analysis, data migration, and data evolution. The fundamental goal in data interoperability is to facilitate and make transparent to end-users the extraction of information from multiple heterogeneous data sources that reside in different locations. At the heart of achieving data interoperability is the design and management of schema mappings. A schema mapping is a specification of the relationship between two database schemas. Schema mappings are the essential building blocks in specifying how data from different sources are to be integrated into a unified format or exchanged (i.e., translated) into a different format.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit of this project is the development of a solid foundation and a suite of techniques and tools for designing, understanding, and managing schema mappings. Earlier foundational work on schema mappings has mainly focused on the semantics and algorithmic issues of some of the basic operators for manipulating schema mappings with emphasis on the composition operator and the inverse operator. While the composition operator is well understood by now, much more remains to be done in the study of the inverse operator. One of the main goals of this project is to investigate in depth the inverse operator and also the difference operator, which remains largely unexplored to date. This project addresses several fundamental questions for the inverse and the difference operators, including the following: What is the right semantics for these two operators? What is the exact language for expressing these operators? Are there efficient algorithms for computing the result of the inverse operator and the difference operator? A parallel goal of this project is the development of a set of concepts and techniques for optimizing schema mapping and transforming more complex schema mappings into simpler, yet equivalent, ones. The final main goal of this project is to study the problem of using data examples to explain and illustrate schema mappings. The design of schema mappings between two schemas has been known to be one of the most costly and time-consuming tasks in achieving data interoperability. Prior studies have suggested that (familiar) data examples can be extremely powerful aids in designing schema mappings. This project addresses the following questions: What is the right notion or notions of illustrative data examples for schema mappings? How easy or difficult it is to compute small examples for illustrating schema mappings? How can one illustrate large and complex networks of schema mappings with data examples? How can one depict the similarities and differences among multiple schema mappings?<br\/><br\/>The broader impact of this project is the development of human resources in science and engineering through the teaching, mentoring, and research training of graduate and undergraduate students on the foundational and system development work of this project.

However, current haptic devices lack integrated tactile feedback, which communicates contact and sliding between fingertips and an object. Although a variety of tactile displays have been developed, most are large bench-top devices and are impractical to place at a user?s fingertips while exploring a virtual object. Simpler, more compact devices will solve this problem and provide a means to create a more compelling virtual touch experience. The overarching objective of this research is to significantly improve the quality of touch feedback obtained with haptic interfaces by improving both the mechanical interface to virtual worlds and the supporting computational methods that generate touch sensations. These advances will be informed by and validated through a progression of human subject experiments that will culminate in two application-based evaluations in the areas of medical bone palpation and virtual assembly.

These affordances determine which actions a robot may perform when interacting with a given object, and thus define the capabilities of the robot at any given time. For example, a doorway affords the possibility to leave one room and enter another, and a handle attached to an object affords the ability to grasp it. The approach being developed leverages a graphical model approach to learn visual categories ? to learn the world contains entities such as doors and handles ? that provide a powerful intermediate representation for affordance prediction and learning.

In this project the PI and his team will, within the context of a Master?s course in information system design, construct and test a series of exercises aimed at promoting innovative designs, inspired by thinking about creative processes in general and the information technology design process in particular. Information design is an ideal platform for the study and promotion of creative processes, because the topological structure of information systems allows development of tools for objective representation of the accuracy, variability, and similarity of designs. Three increasingly broad and sophisticated sets of exercises will be developed and tested. The first set will use exploratory play with the elements of IT design (nodes and links) and priming of fundamental topological structures (trees and hubs) in order to elicit more advanced and creative solutions for initial design problems. The second set will use techniques that encourage abstraction to enable students to transfer designs across domains. The third set will employ perceptual manipulation of design topology and conceptual comparisons of design topologies to increase the variability of design solutions students invent. The tool for representing and comparing designs will be turned into a tool for encouraging the generation of varied and novel designs. Because the experiments will be embedded in a design course, the exercises will benefit both the students and the research. Such an undertaking requires a team with expertise across several disciplines. Collectively, the PI and his team have expertise in human comprehension and production of diagrams, research design and evaluation of educational methods, and the design of software-intensive information systems.

Improvements in the education of designers may be amplified by their efforts in practice and in mentoring other designers over the length of their careers. Although there are many methods recommended for teaching systems design, few of these have been empirically tested. This research is novel in that it will look at the intermediate product of IT design, topological sketches, in order to understand the cognitive processes of creativity. From this, the PI will construct methods to assess and to increase design innovation that will be useful to other researchers and instructors.

The PI and her team of technologists, choreographers and artists will work together to define an evolving system that assists in the design and production of interactive dance performances with real-time audience interaction. The Dance.Draw system will enable dancers' motions, tracked via small RF transmitters worn in satin cuffs, to act as input streams that can be flexibly applied as control parameters for interactive visualizations. The system will log dancers' motions and will be able to composite video of the dancers with different visualizations, enabling post-hoc analysis of the choreography and exploration of prospective mappings between the motion and the projected media. This will allow choreographers to explore interactive dance without always having a full cast of dancers present. In addition, it will enable other stakeholders, such as artists and musicians, to experiment offline with their media and adjust how these interplay with the choreography. The system will be extended into a Web-based \"DanceTube\" application that will allow the public to engage in interactive dance choreography. In addition to using the dancers' movements on stage and the motion of their bodies in place, the PI plans to allow the Dance.Draw system to use input from the audience to provide a feedback loop between the audience, dancers and visualizations. To this end her team will build dual-channel, wireless audience response devices; these handheld meters will allow the audience to explicitly indicate levels of engagement using a knob or slider while simultaneously collecting implicit biometric arousal information via galvanic skin response, both to help evaluate audience response to interactive dance performances and potentially to provide input as well. The aggregate audience response or random individual responses can be mapped to specific types of visualizations, which the dancers can react to, making each performance unique and giving the audience an expanded role in the interaction. Finally, the PI will develop a new standardized survey mechanism to help evaluate the Dance.Draw interface as a creativity support tool; this survey will be applied in user studies throughout the project, and thus will itself be thoroughly tested as an evaluation mechanism.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This interdisciplinary project will promote mutual understanding among artists, choreographers, dancers and technologists. Project outcomes will include new technologies to support human creativity, as well as increased understanding of creative processes during physical, embodied, collaborative activity. The Web-based \"DanceTube\" application will allow the public to experience the process of interactive dance design. The PI will further organize dance camps for school-aged children, in which the new technology will be featured. The results of this research will be disseminated broadly through scientific conferences such as CHI, UIST, and CSCW, and also via dance festivals and dance-related conferences and venues. The PI will make the Dance.Draw application and source code available through a public repository such as Sourceforge.","title":"Dance.Draw: Embodiment as Input for Collaborative, Creative Expression","awardID":"0855882","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2013-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7788","name":"CreativeIT"}}],"PIcoPI":["373254","563995","563991"],"PO":["565227"]},"148061":{"abstract":"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br\/><br\/>This is a renewal of the previously funded REU Site NSF Award No. 0552758.

In addition, technical advances have made it possible to monitor the activity of populations of neurons in human subjects. The volume of data generated by multiple-neuron recordings poses significant challenges for data analysis. The development of new statistical techniques is necessary to provide a meaningful basis for testing hypotheses about the nature of neural coding. One concrete example is in the area of neuronal synchrony. The coordination on a short time scale of neuronal populations has been suggested as the basis for multiple neural processes such as attention and feature binding. However, the co-variation in firing rates among neurons, especially on a short time scale, poses significant practical challenges to specifying appropriate data analysis and statistical methods.<br\/><br\/>This award provides support for an international symposium on the topic of Statistical Modeling and Data Analysis for Neural Coding to be held in conjunction with the International Statistics Institute's biennial meeting at Durban, South Africa, August 2009. This symposium will bring together several statistical experts on neural coding to discuss a range of approaches to this problem. These approaches include both the generation of surrogate data sets and new statistical methods. These statistical methods may also have value for other scientific areas where multiple elements show short time scale temporal co-variation. The symposium is part of a large meeting of statistical experts. In addition to bringing together the symposium speakers to address this issue, the symposium will expose the larger statistical community to these questions and to the new statistical approaches.

The need for multi-resolution makes it difficult for wavelet-like transforms to sparsify local discontinuities, while being invariant to rotations and translations without significant redundancy. The limited ability of wavelet-based sparse reconstruction algorithms to account for this redundancy limits their performance in challenging practical applications. In this context, there is a strong motivation to develop multidimensional image sparsifying operators that are invariant to translations and rotations and is competent in representing edges. This research leads to fundamental advances in several areas of multidimensional signal recovery. Specifically, the investigators apply the framework to significantly accelerate the acquisition of dynamic and spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.<br\/><br\/>The main highlight of this proposal is the generalization of the gradient to obtain a new family of multidimensional operators. The use of these operators results in higher degree total variation (HD-TV) image recovery schemes that (a) are rotation and translation invariant, (b) can represent polynomials of arbitrary degree, and (c) minimize ringing artifacts. To fully exploit the power of this framework in MRI applications, the investigators also develop stable and efficient optimization algorithms and a computational scheme to derive robust sampling patterns. The proposed research projects involves a mix of theory and computation, focused on solving challenging practical problems. The research modules are tuned to provide direct, hands-on experience for graduate and undergraduate students in the processing of multidimensional image data.","title":"CAREER: Efficient Image Sparsifying Operators: Theory, Algorithms and Applications","awardID":"0844812","effectiveDate":"2009-07-01","expirationDate":"2014-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7936","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING"}}],"PIcoPI":["503850"],"PO":["564898"]},"159372":{"abstract":"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION<br\/>Proposal Abstract<br\/><br\/>Proposal Title: Collaborative Research: 1st Sino-USA Summer School in Vision,<br\/>Learning, Pattern Recognition VLPR 2009<br\/>Institution: Princeton University<br\/>Abstract Date: 05\/21\/09<br\/><br\/>The 1st Sino-USA Summer School in Vision, Learning and Pattern Recognition<br\/>(VLPR2009) is the first NSF-sponsored summer school in China that brings together leading American and Chinese researchers and students in the field of computer vision and machine learning for a week of educational and cultural exchange program.

This project explores creativity in the context of an artificial artist -- a system that produces visual representation for the purpose of communicating an internal concept to the viewer. Viewers that experience a connection to the artist via this communication are implicitly and powerfully influenced to attribute creativity to the artist. Since creators are seen to be (or not to be) creative through the perceptions of others, a significant aspect of creativity is the ability of the creator to convince others, explicitly or implicitly, that he or she possesses the attribute. <br\/><br\/>Initially, the project will focus on constructing a system that autonomously creates visual art based on a subject image and markets itself by explaining its selection of subject, choice of style, etc. and possibly the concept the artefact is intended to convey. Eventually, the project will work from an internal concept model to produce an artefact intended to implicitly communicate that concept. The successful completion of the project will result in a computational system to which creativity can be attributed and will explore the role of creativity in understanding and communicating concepts through visual metaphor. The project will involve work in a broad variety of fields including computer vision, natural language processing, cognitive science, design and art, suggesting the potential for interesting advances at the intersection of several of these areas. The project also initiates a dialogue with the artistic community regarding whether artificial systems can successfully establish this kind of abstract communication with human recipients; for example, we have established a collaboration with one of the largest and best attended art museums in the Mountain West, and they have indicated a willingness to pursue a significant exhibition event.","title":"Pilot: Art(ificial): Generation of Creative Visual Metaphor for Communicating Intension","awardID":"0856089","effectiveDate":"2009-07-15","expirationDate":"2013-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7655","name":"ITR-CreativeIT"}}],"PIcoPI":["493953"],"PO":["565227"]},"149255":{"abstract":"Current undergraduate computer science curricula do adequately prepare students to communicate and interpret technical skills to other technical disciplines.

For many applications, this approach can yield significant performance improvement at a relatively low cost. The most significant challenge for heterogeneous computing is the task of matching an arbitrary program to an effective co-processor architecture. This project investigates top-down design automation techniques for analyzing and adapting existing software to the heterogeneous execution model.<br\/><br\/>When adapting scientific software to a heterogeneous computing platform, the software?s most expensive computation is performed on the co-processor, which is usually a custom-designed architecture implemented on an FPGA. This computation, referred to as the kernel, is usually a well-known numerical method or signal transformation. Scientific applications that rely on more exotic or obscure algorithms are rarely adapted for heterogeneous execution. One reason for this is that such applications may not have a well-defined kernel computation, making it difficult to determine which portions of the software, when mapped to the co-processor, will result in the highest overall performance improvement. Another reason is that manually designing special-purpose hardware that performs complex, iterative behavior requires a high level of design effort as well as a high level of expertise in both hardware design and in the specifics of the target application. To address these problems, this research develops a set of systematic techniques for analyzing the runtime behavior of software to determine which components of the software perform the most computation using the least volume of input and output data.

The main conventional approaches to enable such coexistence are: (i) Underlay\/ overlay\/ interweave strategies, which enforce strict constraints on the secondary behavior in order to avoid interference to the primary; and (ii) System-wide dynamic spectrum allocation.
