The design, development, and maintenance of a system can be greatly helped by good documentation of its architecture, that is, of how it is structured into meaningful subsystems or components, and how those subsystems are glued together to form the overall system. A key unresolved problem is the interoperability problem, namely, how the architectural pieces and their multiple and possibly heterogeneous semantic descriptions corresponding to the different views fit together to make a coherent whole, and how these different descriptions impose constraints on each other. The main objectives of this collaborative project are (1) developing mathematical foundations for integrating and interoperating in a coherent and mathematically rigorous way diverse architectural descriptions, formal specifications, and executable prototypes of object-based distributed systems and (2) based on such foundations, developing a methodology for system design, development, and evolution that supports a seamless integration of the different formal and informal system descriptions and makes explicit the constraints that these different views of a system impose on each other. The development of mathematical foundations will be driven by substantial case studies and will begin with an in-depth study of a wide range of notations and formalisms and of their mutual relationships that seem particularly promising for describing systems at different levels. Rewriting logic will play an important role, not only as an executable specification formalism, but also as a reflective metalogical framework in which the chosen formalisms and their relations can be formalized. These formalizations can be executed using the meta tools developed in the Maude language, an implementation of rewriting logic. It is expected that these foundations and experimental methodology will advance the state of the art in software development and evolution, and will lead to new tools and methods that, when used properly, will substantially reduce the cost and effort of software development and maintenance.","title":"NSF-CNPq Collaborative Research: Mathematical and Engineering Foundations for Interoperability via Architecture","awardID":"9900334","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["550264"],"PO":["397849"]},"39095":{"abstract":"Abstract<br\/><br\/>IIS-9900115<br\/>Zabih, Ramin<br\/>Cornell University <br\/>$150,000 - 36 mos.<br\/><br\/>Dynamic Contextual Recognition of Moving Objects<br\/><br\/>This is a standard award of three years.

This career plan consists of a tightly coordinated set of research, education, and mentoring activities designed to address the NII interface and educational needs of individuals with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>Within the broad objectives, the specific research activities of this plan focus on the development of rendering algorithms that will allow individuals with visual impairments access to multidimensional data through haptic and tactile means. Information that is multidimensional, such as complex mathematical expressions or recorded sensor data, is generally displayed in an inaccessible visual form. While tactile and haptic hardware technology continues to advance and can be brought to bear on this problem, relatively little research has been applied to the development of rendering algorithms for the effective display of information. This research will address the following fundamental issues:<br\/><br\/> Optimal data decomposition for low-relief tactile and dynamic haptic display - Methods for extracting data features, including edges, contours, region boundaries, and textures that faithfully represent the underlying data will be developed.<br\/><br\/> Optimal feature and multiresolution display - Display methods that are optimized for the low tactile and kinesthetic bandwidth will be developed.

The proposed techniques feature a tight integration of abstraction techniques and modular verification; they include: (1) Modular Deductive Model Checking: environmental assumptions needed to complete modular proofs are derived as part of the proof.

The proposed research will allow the partial verification of open systems, before their components are fully specified or their environment is known. Since these methods require less interaction, it is feasible to perform more checks on early versions of a system being designed. The techniques will be applicable to general infinite-state reactive systems. In particular, they will be applied to the challenging problems posed by hybrid systems.

Multiple versions of a telecommunications package written in C have been acquired. The data for the proposed research consist of numerous versions of 155 files of C code. The effect of repeated maintenance on each of the files is investigated. Special attention is paid to maintenance activities that precede reimplementation in order to determine precisely how a portion of a software product becomes unmaintainable. In particular, when reimplementation of a portion of a product has occurred, the coupling within that portion is examined over the lifetime of that portion, both before and after the reimplementation. The hypothesis that is tested is that suboptimal coupling is a major cause of poor maintainability.

The basic idea of the Monte Carlo filter is to sequentially generate random samples from the distribution of the current state of the system. Compared with traditional filtering methods, simple, flexible, yet powerful Monte Carlo techniques provide effective means to deal with complex dynamic systems. The investigator studies four specific topics in this research. Topic (I) studies a special Monte Carlo filter called Mixture Kalman filter for the conditional dynamic linear models, a class of widely encountered systems in practice. This filter utilizes the `marginalization' operation to improve efficiency. Topic (II) studies a partial rejection control operation, an operation aimed to generate more efficient random samples in Monte Carlo filters. Topic (III) studies methods to deal with dynamic systems with unknown system coefficients, an important but difficult problem. Topic (IV) is devoted to several applications of Monte Carlo filters, including tracking multiple maneuvering targets in a clutter environment; Bayesian receivers in digital wireless communications; on-line estimation of the market volatility in financial time series analysis; and stochastic system control with non-Gaussian innovations.<br\/><br\/>Dynamic systems are widely used in almost all fields of applications. Examples abound in radar or sonar surveillance systems, in mobile telecommunications, in economic and financial data analysis, in computer vision, in medical diagnostics, in speech recognition, in feed-back control and guidance systems, and in Internet traffic monitoring and control, just to name a few. Most of them are nonlinear and non-Gaussian. One of the main challenges in dealing with dynamic systems is that they usually require on-line (in real time) estimation and prediction (filtering) of the ever-changing system characteristics, given the continuous flow of observations and information from the system. The investigator studies and develops Monte Carlo filters for nonlinear and non-Gaussian dynamic systems. The basic idea of the Monte Carlo filter is to sequentially generate random samples to represent the status (distribution) of the current state of the system. Modern computing power has made it feasible to use Monte Carlo methods as filtering methods in application. Compared with traditional filtering methods, simple, flexible, yet powerful Monte Carlo techniques provide effective means to deal with complex dynamic systems. This research enriches the toolkit of on-line filtering for nonlinear and non-Gaussian dynamic systems. Faster and more effective filtering techniques will certainly have significant impact on a wide range of important applications in real life and make significant contributions to advancing science and technology. It also promotes the interdisciplinary research between engineering and statistics.","title":"Monte Carlo Filters for Nonlinear and Non-Gaussian Dynamic Systems","awardID":"9982846","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0304","name":"Division of MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES","abbr":"DMS"},"pgm":{"id":"1269","name":"STATISTICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0504","name":"Division of MICROELECTRONIC INFOR PROCESS","abbr":"MIP"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["478395"],"PO":["517983"]},"46095":{"abstract":"EIA-9977815<br\/>Chaudhary, Vipin<br\/>Guy, Edjlali<br\/>Wayne State University<br\/><br\/>MRI: Acquisition of a Cluster of Symmetric Multiprocessors<br\/><br\/>The purpose of this proposal is to set up a high performance computing cluster consisting of symmetric multiprocessors connected by a high speed switched network to support research and training in an advanced parallel programming environment.

As client access bandwidth further increases, the demand for high-quality audio\/video streaming will grow. Emerging applications include orchestrated media applications, such as distance learning, that combine audio, video, images, and text from one or more sources. Other challenging multimedia applications are on the horizon, including virtual reality and distributed interactive simulation. These applications involve both constant-bit-rate and variable-bit-rate streams of varying popularity, and different degrees of support for user interactivity, such as VCR or branching operations.<br\/> These emerging high-quality multimedia applications will pose serious challenges to the network infras-tructure. A common thread among these applications is the so-called \"continuous\" nature of their data. In continuous media (CM), strict timing relationships exist that define the schedule by which CM data must be rendered (e.g., a video displayed or audio played out). In a network setting, the playout timing constraints, the rate variability of specific CM such as variable bit rate (VBR) video, the possibility of packet loss and delay within the network, and the desire to use network resources efficiently combine to make the delivery of CM data an exceptionally challenging problem. The challenge of delivering high-quality audio and video is further complicated by the fact that a single network service provider typically does not control the entire path from the source to the end client(s). One promising approach to addressing these challenges is to deploy proxy services within the network. Proxies can hide heterogeneity, reduce user start-up latency, lower the network resource usage, and adapt to fluctuations in network performance properties.<br\/> In this proposal, the project director outlines research whose goal is to develop and evaluate proxy services that improves the perceived quality of CM streams seen by clients while providing low startup latencies. The project will focus on the development of the services themselves, the underlying resource management mechanisms required at the proxy, the programming interface required so that these services access the resource management mechanisms, and characterizations of the workloads and access patterns typically encountered by such proxies.

The latter support a goal-directed proof search, but the former are superior for logics with equality and similar domains. The most spectacular success for theorem proving to date---the solution of the Robbins problem was obtained with a saturation method.<br\/><br\/>In saturation-based deduction, redundancy is a key concept. Formulas or inferences are redundant if they either do not contribute to any derivation of a contradiction, or else contribute in ways that allow for alternative, but simpler derivations. If all inferences from a set are redundant, the set is called saturated and is inconsistent only if there is an explicit contradiction. Saturation thus provides a basis for checking for inconsistency. An inference can always be rendered redundant by adding its conclusion to the current set of formulas, but techniques that avoid the generation of redundant formulas are indispensable for efficiency reasons. The objectives of this project are to develop further insights into this process and to advance theorem proving technology by focusing on three key technique---saturation, extension, and combination.<br\/><br\/>Approximation refers to techniques such as unification and constraints that connect inferences at different levels, for variable-free and general formulas, respectively. The performance of saturation provers often depends on the subtle interaction between approximation and redundancy techniques. The extension of a formal language by new symbols has different uses in automated deduction, e.g., in congruence closure algorithms. This research aims at developing a theory of congruence closure as saturation-based decision procedures, to include not only standard congruence closure, but also extensions to richer theories and elimination methods for translating back to the original language.<br\/><br\/>Saturation techniques have been implicitly used in computer algebra methods such as Buchberger's algorithm or Wu's method for proving theorems in geometry. The plan is to reformulate these methods in logical terms so as to integrate them in general-purpose provers and apply theorem proving techniques to obtain optimized or extended decision procedures.","title":"Saturation-Based Theorem Proving","awardID":"9902031","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2876","name":"DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":[100902],"PO":["321058"]},"39364":{"abstract":"9900909 Volpano, Dennis M.

The main reason is the prohibitive cost of the hardware, which puts optical networks out of reach for all but a few users.<br\/>The research proposed here takes aim at some of these prohibitive costs and is intended to help network designers answer some questions related to dimensioning and component-sizing that can help reduce hardware costs.<br\/><br\/>The proposed research takes as a starting point an all-optical circuit-switched multifiber avelength-routing ring, a tested technology, and asks the question ``Can high performance be obtained with less hardware?'' While many aspects of a network (ranging from manufacturability to higher-level software design) make up the overall cost, this project focuses on reducing costs by limiting the complexity (crosspoints) of optical switches and from more effectively using available bandwidth by time-slotting.<br\/><br\/>Three types of resource allocation problems that arise from these cost considerations will be investigated and algorithms that perform resource allocation will be designed and evaluated.<br\/><br\/>The first type of problem involves limiting the flexibility of fiber-to-fiber switches in an effort to reduce the cost of manufacturing switches. Preliminary results indicate that near-optimal throughput can be obtained even with significant reduction in the connectivity of the switch. Some research questions that will be addressed in this case are: how does performance vary quantitatively with limitations in switching to fibers? does wavelength allocation differ fundamentally with these restrictions?<br\/><br\/>The second type of problem involves constructing larger networks from smaller rings. Research questions for this problem include: how should all-optical multiple rings be connected in a cost-effective manner, especially by using fiber-switching limitations? how should wavelengths be partitioned (if at all) for inter-ring and intra-ring sessions?<br\/><br\/>The third type of problem involves efficiently scheduling multi-rate sessions in an optical network with slots (time-division multiplexing). The practical feasibility of this technology has already been demonstrated. The focus here is on resource allocation problems that, by more effectively using bandwidth with fiber-switching limitations, reduce overall network cost.<br\/><br\/>Finally, an integrative approach will be taken to study network performance when all three types of design features are present. The research results are intended to be applicable in the near future, and therefore the initial approach will use a combination of simulation and modeling, whereas later the PIs will aim for a deeper theoretical understanding of the problem.","title":"Improving the Cost Effectiveness of WDM Optical Networks","awardID":"9973098","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["531651","564881"],"PO":["234222"]},"39640":{"abstract":"CCR-9901689<br\/>\"Graph-Based Mobile-Code Representations for High-Performance Portable<br\/>Software\"<br\/>Michael Franz<br\/><br\/>This project investigates machine-independent program representations <br\/>for mobile-code applications.

However, given that the number of flows in a backbone routers can be on the order of hundred of thousands, the complexity incurred by per-flow management mechanisms may prevent them from being effectively implemented and widely deployed.<br\/><br\/>To address these problems, the principal investigator (PI) proposes an architecture, called Scalable Core (SCORE for short) in which the network is partitioned in continuous regions, called islands. Within each island the PI distinguishes between edge and core nodes. While the edge nodes perform per flow management, the core nodes do not. Since edge nodes manage fewer flows and at the limit an edge node can be a host, this architecture is highly scalable. The main goal is then to use the SCORE architecture to approximate a reference island in which all nodes perform per flow management. In this way it is possible to provide<br\/>efficient support for a wide variety of resource management policies.<br\/><br\/>To approximate the reference network the PI introduces two schemes. In the first scheme, each ingress node labels every packet as it enters the network with the state of the flow (e.g., rate) to which it belongs. Further, each core node processes the packet based on its label and the node state (e.g., utilization). In the second scheme, the states of all nodes on the flow's path are aggregated and sent to the edge nodes. Based on this information and the flow state, the edge routers decide how to process an incoming packet (e.g., forward or drop it).<br\/><br\/>The PI plans to develop an integrated set of algorithms within the SCORE framework to support congestion control for best-effort service, end-to-end QoS guarantee, and differential services.

However, unlike the geometric growth of cellular (voice) wireless, wireless data has languished. There are many possible reasons, but the most striking is one of high cost. It therefore makes sense to reconsider some of the basic assumptions about wireless systems such as fixed proprietary infrastructure and licensed bandwidth which tend to raise the costs. Specifically, there is a need to understand at a fundamental level how systems can peacefully coexist when they mutually interfere in unlicensed bands (such as the recently allocated 5GHz U-NII bands) and may even co-inhabit the same areas. Thus, the proposed work will carefully explore an extremely simple design precept for use in such seemingly chaotic multi-system environments -- adjust transmitted waveforms and reception techniques to avoid interference -- \"interference avoidance\" for short.<br\/><br\/>Specifically, the emergence of programmable digital radios prompts the consideration of wireless systems comprised of elements which can vary both their output waveforms and received-signal processing. It has already been shown that ensembles of adaptive transmitters communicating synchronously with a single receiver can OPTIMIZE their use of the wireless medium by practicing interference avoidance. The proposed work will deepen and extend the theoretical understanding of interference avoidance by considering asynchronous systems, dispersive channels, multi-element antenna arrays and probably most important, systems with multiple receivers. At each juncture, information theoretic bounds will be sought since these provide clear bounds on performance.

Tsividis, Columbia University<br\/><br\/><br\/>ABSTRACT<br\/><br\/><br\/>The context of this work is fully integrated systems involving a computer plus an analog signal processor. The latter is often a necessary part of the interface to the physical world in such fields as telecommunications, computers, multimedia, automotive systems, medical instrumentation, and robotics. When the overall requirements are stringent, attempts to implement the required analog signal processor using conventional circuits can result in very large power consumption and chip size, making the entire system impractical. This can be traced to fundamental limitations of linear circuits. To bypass such limitations, this research deals with input-output linear signal processors which are permitted to be internally nonlinear. This allows the internal signals to have, for a large input signal range, a magnitude well above that of noise and interference, while at the same time remaining safely below overload levels. The result is adequate signal integrity over the entire range, without requiring large power consumption and chip size. This approach extends the use of companding (compressing\/expanding) techniques, commonly employed in signal transmission and recording, to signal processing.<br\/><br\/><br\/>The first phase of this research was a study of the signal and noise properties of externally linear, internally nonlinear signal processors, as well as of signal-noise interactions. Based on the results of this phase, a study of appropriate architectures and appropriate choice of internal nonlinearities is being undertaken, with low power dissipation and practicality of implementation in mind. For these architectures and nonlinearities, appropriate circuit design techniques are being developed. Both syllabic and instantaneous companding are being considered, along with combinations thereof. The final phase of the project will be a demonstration of the results obtained using test chips, meant to satisfy a relevant set of stringent specifications. Since the processors are internally nonlinear, special attention will be given to extensive measurements for their characterization, particularly of input-output linearity, noise, signal-noise interaction, and dynamic range.","title":"Low-Power, Wide Dynamic Range Companding Analog Signal Processors","awardID":"9902781","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["526881"],"PO":["564898"]},"58385":{"abstract":"","title":"RUI: Minority Research and Education in High Performance Computing","awardID":"0096056","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4080","name":"ADVANCED COMP RESEARCH PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"4066","name":"PART FOR ADVANCED COMP INFRA"}}],"PIcoPI":[150030],"PO":["565272"]},"45075":{"abstract":"Future networks are expected to offer solutions for the communication needs of a wide variety of applications. The goals of the proposed research are to address the issues related to the design of future optical networks. In particular, the design of scalable architectures and algorithms to manage, control, and deliver the required level of service efficiently is the primary goal. The proposal is based on the use of optical fiber technology, wavelength division multiplexing, wavelength conversion, and wavelength sharing. The objective is to develop solutions that will support a contract between source, destination, and network, and allow the use of gigabit bandwidths for user applications. The proposal is based on the sharing of a limited number of wavelengths among multiple users, the utilization of limited wavelength convesion capability in the network, and the use of multi-fiber links to support loss- and conflict-free communication for individual users by allocating dedicated resources to each connection. Specifically, the following research issues will be addressed. The balance between the minimum granularity of allocatable resources that can be supported by the available technology of WDM, wavelength sharing, wavelength conversion, multi-fiber links, and user needs will be indentified. Using this information base, new architectures and corresponding algorithms for resource allocation policies that efficiently utilize network resources will be developed. The architectural solutions will include spare capacity to tolerate single-fiber failures. When wavelength sharing is employed, different sources may transmit in a controlled manner such that they achieve their average rates. However, depending on the sharing mechanism, delay may be an important factor. Minimizing session blocking probabilities and delays in data delivery are the main issues in setting up session requests. An aim of this proposal is to develop effective solutions for this problem. Distributed routing algorithms that minimize both of these metrics in setting up an end-to-end request will be developed and evaluated. The results of the proposed research are expected to make significant advances towards the use of WDM-based all-optical technology. The initial approach to solve the proposed problems is to evaluate the proposed architectures using analytical models and simulations. The results of the initial studies will be used in developing alternative architectures and sophisticated routing algorithms.","title":"Collaborative Research: Exploring Architectures and Algorithms for Optical Networks","awardID":"9973102","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2004-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["521840"],"PO":["565090"]},"39520":{"abstract":"99-01321<br\/>Siewiorek, Daniel<br\/>Koopman, Philip<br\/>Carnegie Mellon University<br\/><br\/>CISE Experimental Partnerships: Processing\/Communication\/Interface<br\/>Tradeoffs to Optimize Energy Locality in Mobile Systems<br\/><br\/>As computers continue to shrink, research and commercial interest in mobile\/wearable computing is rapidly growing. Unlike traditional desktop computing in which the user is required to come to the computer, mobile computing brings the computer to the user. One of the key problems with mobile\/wearable computing is energy consumption. Battery weight for mobile\/wearable computers often exceeds the weight of all other components combined. In order to make mobile\/wearable computing widely applicable, major advances in reducing power consumption and battery weight are needed. In this research a testbed, Infocator, is being developed to study energy issues in mobile\/wearable computing.<br\/><br\/>Mobile\/wearable systems are typically comprised of both computing and communications systems. While power consumption required by the computing component is rapidly decreasing, power consumption required by the communications component is not keeping pace. It is estimated that by the year 2001, nearly 80% of the power consumed by mobile\/wearable will be due to communications.<br\/><br\/>Trading off energy-expensive communication for energy cheap computation through effective partitioning of control and data can result in significant energy savings. Methods for determining the ideal control\/data<br\/>partitioning are being developed and codified in a Theory of Energy Locality. To realize the partitioning and facilitate control movement, a generic application independent framework for proxies is also being<br\/>developed. <br\/><br\/>To maximize the effectiveness of wearable systems in mobile computing environments, the interface design ust be carefully matched with user tasks and balanced against energy consumption. Many complex and interrelated issues determine the balance between ease-of-use and power consumption. Simply trading off ase-of-use for lower per operation power consumption may result in higher task energy consumption due to the increase in the number of operations needed to traverse a less intuitive interface. The effect of user interface on energy consumption is also being evaluated by developing several different interfaces for nfocator and measuring and comparing the ease-of-use and energy consumption.","title":"CISE Experimental Partnerships: Processing\/Communication\/ Interface Tradeoffs to Optimize Energy Locality in Mobile Systems","awardID":"9901321","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4725","name":"EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEMS\/CADRE"}}],"PIcoPI":[100253,"492191"],"PO":["241298"]},"38673":{"abstract":"Rapid advances in information technology have led to increased demand for the storage, management, access, and use of multimedia objects.

This research seeks to understand shape-aware robotic manipulation in order to improve the versatility of robots interacting with their environments. As robots become more human-assistive, they will need to manipulate a large variety of novel objects of varying shapes and sizes. Key to recognizing and manipulating these objects will be the integration of numerous passive and active sensory modalities. This research focuses on the information content of active tactile manipulation strategies. For instance, when grasping an object of known shape and dynamics but unknown pose, the time history of the contact points on the fingers often provides enough constraint to reveal the orientation of the object. More difficult is the task of picking up an object of unknown shape and unknown dynamics. Again, the finger configurations required to touch the object provide constraints on the possible shapes of the object. As the fingers move and the object slips in the fingers, these constraints evolve over time, thereby permitting reconstruction of the shape of the object.<br\/>The difference between theses tasks lies primarily in the number of fingers required to touch the object, the degree of active manipulation, and the character of internal models. In between these extremes of known and unknown shape lie more typical tasks, in which<br\/>partial shape information exists. For instance, a human or robot may know the rough shape and pose of an object from visual inspection; grasping strategies then reveal the fine shape and dynamics. The impact of this research lies most directly in manipulation, with possible additional impact on haptic displays and industrial automation. The shape-sensing routines produced by this research will make it easier to program robots. Rather than requiring a robot programmer to measure object shapes and locations precisely, this<br\/>research will provide automatic methods for extracting that information during robot manipulation. Such automatic methods will facilitate robotic aids. Moreover, understanding the nature of the shape information produced during manipulation will facilitate the design of better haptic devices.","title":"Designing Robotic Desktop Assistants Using Dynamics-based Shape-Sensing","awardID":"9820180","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["196088"],"PO":["234178"]},"36321":{"abstract":"IIS-9820224<br\/>Carlo Tomasi<br\/>Stanford University<br\/>$250,043 - 36 mos<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>The Sensitivity of Structure-from-Motion: A Comprehensive Theoretical and Experimental Study<br\/><br\/><br\/>This is a three year standard award. The PI will carry out a general theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation of the sensitivity of structure-from-motion (SFM). This task requires the development of techniques that extend the state of the art not only of computer vision but also of statistical parameter estimation. Specifically, methods for propagating full densities from measurements to unknowns will be developed for nonsquare problems (more measurements than unknowns), and standard covariance propagation techniques will be extended to constrained optimization problems with implicit formulations. New techniques will be developed for the decomposition of ill-posed problems into solvable and unsolvable components. Using these techniques, the sensitivity of standard formulations of SFM will be analyzed systematically, and without the use of noise generators. In addition, the effects of nonlinearities will be understood more completely than in previous studies. Comparison with experimental results, made possible by newly proposed calibration methods, will validate the theoretical conclusions and will lead to a clear delineation of which SFM computations are possible with a given level of camera quality and for a given performance requirement. The decomposition of SFM problems into solvable and unsolvable components, as well as the partition of performance space into feasible and infeasible problems, will lead to a new algorithm that combines successful special-case algorithms in a principled and general way.","title":"The Sensitivity of Structure-From-Motion: A Comprehensive Theoretical and Experimental Study","awardID":"9820224","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["513187"],"PO":["564456"]},"46012":{"abstract":"EIA-9977540<br\/>Weinberg, Martin D.<br\/>Auerbach, Scott M.<br\/>University of Massachusetts Amherst<br\/><br\/>MRI: Acquisition of a High-Performance Parallel Computer to Support an Interdisciplinary Computational Science Center for Physical Science, Mathematics and Engineering<br\/><br\/>This is a proposal to construct a high-performance computing platform to enhance the state of scientific computing at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.

The purpose of this project is to advance our understanding of tapping as a mode of manipulation. Tapping, in its most basic form, consists of striking an object, imparting some initial velocities, and then<br\/>letting it slide until it comes to rest due to friction. The goal of this project is to develop general motion planning algorithms and stable feedback control techniques for positioning tasks using tapping. The main focus of this research is understanding the role of part shape and actuator constraints in these problems. Part shape affects both the mechanics of sliding and how the object can be struck to generate initial velocities. Actuator constraints, such as using fixed-position tapping actuators, limit the taps that can be applied to the object. Motion planning and feedback control must account for both types of constraints in order to create and execute robust tapping plans. This work will be evaluated experimentally by building a \"tapping micropositioning cell\" which will precisely position a part by repeatedly sensing its configuration and firing one of the<br\/>fixed-position tapping actuators about the perimeter of the cell.","title":"Motion Planning and Control For Tapping","awardID":"9977562","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["121542"],"PO":["234178"]},"46397":{"abstract":"First and second generation wireless networks have had a remarkable success in providing voice services with global coverage. Building on this success, third and fourth generation networks are envisioned with more emphasis on flexible data rather than voice services. Such an infrastructure will enable the implementation of advanced and diverse wireless services which are perhaps not yet imagined. One of the thorniest technical challenges in implementing high speed wireless data networks is that of multiplexing variable-bit-rate data users over the wireless channel. Classical solutions like TDMA, FDMA, or even CDMA are not appropriate, since they adhere to a connection-oriented, rather than packet-based, connectionless philosophy. Random access techniques on the other side offer the required flexibility, but suffer from severe throughput\/delay penalties under heavy traffic. In order to handle the anticipated diverse traffic mix, novel Medium Access (MAC) schemes have to be developed. As the NSF 99-68 initiative underlines, there is growing consensus that such novel solutions require breaking away from the traditional layered approach to network design, moving towards integrated design across multiple layers.<br\/><br\/>The goal of this research is an integrated approach to wireless packet network design that cuts across the medium access and physical layers. Starting from a recently introduced MAC protocol (termed NDMA for Network Diversity Multiple Access) which utilizes MAC-level network resources to create a synergy between the physical and MAC layers, the investigators study joint collision resolution, blind beamforming, and power control in packet radio networks, with the goal of demonstrating substantial throughput-delay performance gains over traditional layered designs.

Blind schemes in turn are desirable in fading multipath environments where frequent changes in the channel dynamics, makes training signals very wasteful. Most of the blind Fractionally Spaced Equalization literature has been devoted to linear channels. Yet many channels such as satellite and microwave channels with nonlinear amplifiers, underwater and magnetic recording channels are inherently nonlinear. This is particularly so if the amplifiers operate in their most power efficient regimes. Further, in fiber optical communications, having an abundant bandwidth, the greatest challenge, is posed by dispersive nonlinearities in the channel.

Three trends in scientific computing suggest that this important matrix operation will have an increasingly greater role to play in the future. First, the application areas where Kronecker products abound are all thriving. These include signal processing, image processing, semidefinite programming, and quantum computing. Second, sparse factorizations and Kronecker products are proving to be the preferred way to look at fast linear transforms. Researchers have taken the Kronecker methodology as developed for the fast Fourier transform and used it to build exciting alternatives. Third, as computers get more powerful, researchers are more willing to entertain problems of high dimension and this leads to Kronecker products whenever low-dimension techniques are \"tensored\" together. Moreover, Kronecker products are a useful way to keep track of data motion in memory hierarchies that are the hallmark of advanced machines. <br\/><br\/>In light of these developments, the goal of this project is to widen the use of the Kronecker product in numerical linear algebra.

All of the algorithmic work will culminate in production of Matlab and C++ libraries. The research will heighten the profile of the Kronecker product throughout the field of matrix computations and thereby make it easier for researchers to spot Kronecker \"opportunities\" in their work.

One lesson of cellular telephone network operation is that effective radio resource management (power control, channel assignment and handoffs) is essential to promote the quality and efficiency of a system. Radio resource management will be equally, if not more, critical in systems that include high-speed data signals. This research focuses on developing a new framework for radio resource management in wireless data networks. The new approach considered here relies on using microeconomic theories that take into account notions utility (level of satisfaction of a user) and pricing (cost charged to a user) in developing distributed radio resource management algorithms for wireless data services. This research will make fundamental contributions that impact knowledge and technology in the currently evolving third generation of wireless systems. <br\/><br\/>A model for the utility of a data user is developed that is based on the number of useful bits that a wireless terminal can transfer over the lifetime of its battery. Based on such a model for the utility wireless data user derives from using the system, distributed power control algorithms that maximize utility are considered. Formulating these algorithms as noncooperative games, conditions for feasibility of such power control as well as existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium achieved by the non-cooperative game are investigated. The resulting equilibria are shown to be Pareto inefficient, thereby motivating the introduction of pricing to achieve Pareto improvements in efficiency. The goals of this research are to investigate utility and pricing functions that will drive distributed resource management schemes (optimization algorithms) to Pareto efficient operating points. Specific issues to be considered include noncooperative games based on power and rate optimization, utility maximization under delay constraints, information theoretic notions of utility and corresponding games, and dynamic pricing under energy-constrained transmission.

Not only will more devices of increasingly diverse types compete for wireless media, but new applications based on wireless technology will also make more intensive use of this scarce resource, with strict requirements for Quality of Service (QoS) attributes such as throughput, security, and reliability. Despite technological advances, however, certain key features of wireless systems are expected to remain unchanged. For instance, wireless systems will continue to operate in an exceptionally dynamic execution environment in which bandwidth and other resources can vary significantly over time. The diversity of available resources (e.g., power, CPU speed, memory, transmission power and bandwidth) at the wireless devices and the wired base stations will also undoubtedly persist. This project proposes a wireless architecture that uses fine-grain configurability and fast coordinated adaptation as fundamental cornerstones for providing QoS for applications in such a diverse and dynamically changing environment. Fine-grain configurability allows the software on each device to be customized to the characteristics of that device, the executing application, and the current execution environment, while fast coordinated adaptation allows the configuration to be changed dynamically at runtime. Unlike current efforts, the focus on adaptability is on coordination across multiple layers and among multiple devices to support more global optimizations and the need for dramatic changes in the networking software. The latter could be used, for example, in a natural disaster to alter the network routing protocols used by affected wireless systems to compensate for the loss of fixed base stations.<br\/><br\/>The starting point for this work is Cactus, a system for constructing highly-configurable network protocols and other services from fine-grain software modules that interact using an event-driven execution paradigm. Cactus will provide the implementation framework for the various components on different system layers, ranging from device drivers to applications, as well as the basis for realizing the adaptive behavior within each component. The proposed wireless architecture also adds new system components that coordinate adaptations across different system layers and different devices in a wireless network. The overall architecture offers a platform where a system is constructed of highly adaptive system layers and the adaptations of different layers are optimized locally for the specific requirements of each application and globally to meet broader system requirements. Thus, it has the potential to serve as a good platform for new wireless applications with strict QoS requirements. The goals of the proposed research include the design of the overall system architecture, development of adaptation mechanisms, construction of example adaptive protocols, investigation of adaptation and coordination policies, and experimental validation. Two different prototyping environments will be used. The first is an existing cluster of 64 Pentium PCs, where wireless communication is simulated over a wired 100 Mb Ethernet. This platform makes it easy to experiment with issues such as failures of base stations, location-aware protocols, and vertical handoffs between different wireless networking solutions. The second testbed is a collection of portable PCs with a selection of different wireless networking hardware and GPS receivers for location-aware computing.","title":"WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY: Coordinated Fast Adaptation in Wireless Systems","awardID":"9979438","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2004-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":[118484,118485],"PO":["250082"]},"36640":{"abstract":"Intelligent systems and simulated environments require intuitive interfaces for man-machine interaction.

Perhaps most importantly, it is the principle underlying most of the key diagnostic imaging modalities including x-ray Tomography (CT), PET and SPECT, certain forms of MRI, and emerging techniques such as electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and optical tomography. Tomography is also the fundamental principle in numerous other problems and applications in science and engineering -- from electron microscopy of subcellular structures and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) in manufacturing, through geophysical exploration and environmental monitoring, to remote sensing by synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The most widely used technique for solving the tomographic problem is known as Filtered Backprojection (FBP), and is ubiquitous in the realm of medical x-ray CT. But the FBP method is slow, and new technologies are making data acquisition possible at rates that cannot be handled by the FBP method and existing computer technology. This research involves new ways of solving the tomography problem that use a very small fraction of the effort required by the FBP.<br\/><br\/>The investigator is studying a number of promising techniques for accelerating the FBP reconstruction algorithm. He has discovered that the Radon transform can be factored in a special way, and that this new factorization leads to an O(N^2 log N) method (for reconstructing an N X N image from N projections) for solving the tomographic problems, as opposed to the FBP method, which is an O(N^3) method. For large N, as are typically encountered in third or fourth generation x-ray CT systems, this represents a speedup of nearly two orders of magnitude. This research also involves the use of this factorization to accelerate solutions to more complicated tomographic problems, in which data are missing or distorted.","title":"Fast Algorithms for Tomography","awardID":"9972980","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["551068"],"PO":["564898"]},"36586":{"abstract":"CCR-9820896<br\/>Vazirani<br\/><br\/>This project pursues research in the following areas:<br\/><br\/>1.

The difficulty of learning can vary in different learning models. The models represent different conditions under which learning might take place. A major goal of this project is to distinguish, in a variety of learning models, between classes of Boolean functions that are efficiently learnable and classes that are not.<br\/><br\/>Among the learning models that will be studied are query models and attribute-efficient models. In query models, the learning algorithm can obtain information about the function being learned by asking queries. Query models represent situations in which the learner has access to a teacher or expert, or can perform experiments and observe outcome. In attribute-efficient models, the learner is expected to learn efficiently even in the presence of a lot of irrelevant information. The presence of irrelevant information is a common complication in applied machine learning problems such as automatic text categorization.<br\/><br\/>Another major aspect of this project concerns characterizations of classes of Boolean functions. The project aims to discover connections between characterizations of Boolean function classes and the complexity of learning and recognizing functions in those classes. This approach is inspired in part by work in graph theory. The characterization of Boolean function classes has not been studied as extensively as the characterization of graph classes. A goal of the project is to do for classes of Boolean functions what has been done for classes of graphs: to establish connections between characterizations of classes and the complexity of problems involving the classes. A focus of this project will be on classes of Boolean functions that are closed under basic operations, such as permutation of variables, and substitution of constants for variables. The motivation for restricting attention to such function classes is to obtain elegant results in learning and complexity, results that may not hold for all Boolean function classes.","title":"On Learning and Characterizing Classes of Boolean Functions","awardID":"9877122","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2004-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["518057"],"PO":["543507"]},"46068":{"abstract":"EIA-9977717<br\/>Khatib, Oussama<br\/>Roth, Bernard<br\/>Stanford University<br\/><br\/>MRI: Design and Development of a Testbed for a New Generation of Robots for Human Environments<br\/><br\/>The goal of this project is to develop a testbed for safe, compliant, and compact robotic arms suitable for the emerging generation of robots destined to operate in human environments.

Such optimization problems include and are closely related to semidefinite programming (SDP) and quadratically constrained <br\/>quadratic programming (QCQP). In the first part, general techniques for both degeneracy properties and their impact on numerical behavior of various algorithms will be studied thoroughly. Particular attention will be given to the problem of dealing with absences of strict complementarity which thus far has eluded satisfactory numerical behavior in all known algorithms. Next, the process of extending special proof techniques and tools which were originally developed for analysis of the semidefinite and convex quadratically constrained quadratic programs, to the more general venue of symmetric cone optimization will be carried out. The techniques developed by interior point researchers will be extended to all symmetric cone optimization problems. A potential impact of this aspect of the research will be unification of various efforts in <br\/>interior point studies, especially the primal-dual methods, to the more general area of symmetric cone optimization which includes linear, semidefinite, and quadratically constrained quadratic programming as special case.<br\/> <br\/>Next, the central problem of using the optimal solution of an SDP (or a QCQP) to \"warm start\" another SDP (or QCQP) that differs from the original by one or few new constraints or variables will be investigated . This effort is central in order to make SDP or QCQP serious tools for solving large integer or mixed integer programs via branch and bound, cutting planes or similar techniques. A particular goal is to invent new dual based active set methods to carry out this goal. The project will start with perhaps the easier problem of investigating QCQP both in its own right and in order to gain insight in the <br\/>effort to tackle SDP and ultimately general symmetric cone optimization problems. Also there is a puzzling gap in using QCQP problems as relaxation of integer programs. While LP and SDP relaxation abound, the QCQP approach has been use only on limited problems such as plant location and Steiner trees. A general scheme to relax any (zero-one) integer program to QCQP is missing. A goal of this effort is to design such a general relaxation. The impact is potentially significant. While SDP at least in principle seems to be more powerful than LP to as a relaxation of integer programs, the difficulty of solving large scale problems, especially lack of satisfactory techniques to solve sparse problems, has so far limited its wide scale use. The limitations on QCQP are much less severe and a general relaxation scheme to these problems could have significant <br\/>impact on at least some integer programming problems.<br\/><br\/>Next new relaxation of integer program to more general convex programs than the traditional linear programming or SDP will be studied. A particular scheme based on using norms more general than the Euclidean norm will potentially yield new class of cones to which one can extend SDP relaxation. This work will be <br\/>theoretical and fundamental at the outset.<br\/><br\/>Numerical study and in particular use of sparse structure encompasses another aspect of the project. In particular unlike semidefinite programming and somewhat like linear programming there is an significant opportunity in taking advantage of sparsity in order to solve large scale QCQP problems with primal-dual interior point methods. The details are different than linear programming and present considerable challenge in designing numerically stable and efficient algorithms. <br\/><br\/>Software development will also be a central part of the investigation. Especially due to the vast variety of formats that SDP and QCQP, and in general symmetric cone optimization problems arise in applications, a user friendly interface will be essential if the software will be of wide applicability. <br\/>Therefore, in addition to implementing and fine tuning the \"solver engine\", an elaborate shell around the engine is planned. This interface ill be designed to accommodate various problems form eigenvalue optimization to sum of norms constraints. As much as possible format conversions will be automated. Interface to popular public modeling languages such as AMPL is planned. In addition WEB based interaction between users and software (such as web based submission of data, or cross platform interaction between user's data and the software) is planned.

Ethernet<br\/>networks are rapidly transitioning from half-duplex CSMA\/CD to full-duplex switched operation. While much of the current research in ATM networks is relevant to both types of networks, there are significant remaining problems in the area of Ethernet networks that urgently need to be addressed. These problems include:<br\/> 1. The traffic characteristics of future gigabit applications have not yet been predicted. Current traffic<br\/>models may not be applicable for gigabit applications. Therefore, better knowledge of traffic from<br\/>expected gigabit applications is needed to be able to predict network performance.<br\/> 2. For high-speed networks, memory speed limits output buffered and shared memory switch architectures to low port densities. For this reason, scheduling algorithms which achieve high throughputs for input buffered only ATM switches have been the subject of recent research. Yet, there do not exist scheduling algorithms or switch architectures which accommodate variable length packets and Quality of Service (QoS) in input buffered only switches and full-duplex repeaters.<br\/> 3. While switched operation will likely be predominant in future networks, inefficiencies in gigabit half-duplex CSMA\/CD Ethernet still remain and need to be addressed.<br\/> The objective of this four year CAREER program is to address these problems. Existing traffic models are<br\/>largely based on time series analysis of traffic traces resulting in a limited understanding of the causes of observed traffic characteristics. New knowledge will be gained by instrumenting application and protocol implementations to study the user behavior, source data objects, and application and protocol behaviors of expected gigabit applications. Using the resulting traffic models as input to performance models that will be developed, methods for highly scalable, input buffered only switches to provide high throughput and efficient support for bursty, best-effort data traffic and guaranteed-service traffic streams will be advanced. The hypothesis is that by using traffic shaping at each input port, the scheduling algorithm can be made simple and scalable. The applicability of packet bursting and spacing, priority queueing, and selective PAUSE flow control will be studied. To support CSMA\/CD on large span, half-duplex Gigabit Ethernet networks with high-data rates, the current minimum 64-byte packet size must effectively be increased to 512 bytes to allow for correct collision detection. The IEEE 802.3 Gigabit Ethernet standard uses packet bursting to transmit small packets. A more efficient and interoperable method of operation whereby late collisions are permitted, can be detected, and handled correctly will be studied.<br\/> A systems and experimental approach will be used to tackle the problems. A laboratory of Gigabit Ethernet<br\/>attached personal computers and servers will be built. This laboratory will be used for direct perimentation, as a facility for parallel execution of simulation models, and for related educational activities at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. A tool for parallel independent replications of simulation models will be developed and made generally available. Much more significantly, new ideas in traffic modeling, new knowledge in switch scheduling for variable length packets with support for QoS, and new methods for using CSMA\/CD in large span, half-duplex Ethernet networks will be presented in appropriate conferences and journals, and to standards bodies. To solicit input and generate external participation, a WWW site with a bulletin board will be established for researchers and developers from academia and industry to share software tools, new ideas, and findings.

The PIs plan to adopt a broad, generic approach to understanding the co-evolution of knowledge networks. Knowledge networks may share important common structural properties across levels, or may develop in similar ways. Where that proves to be true, theories at one level can be expanded to apply to networks at several levels; where network properties diverge, existing theories will be modified and new ones developed. The theory generated by this research, the computational models tested and the statistical techniques developed will have important scientific implications beyond the substantive research findings of this project; they will be applicable to human networks in other contexts as well as to a variety of knowledge and network issues in society, and will also significantly enhance future statistical analysis of many forms of networks.","title":"KDI: Co-evolution of Knowledge Networks and 21st Century Organizational Forms: Computational Modeling and Empirical Testing","awardID":"9980109","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8877","name":"KDI-COMPETITION"}}],"PIcoPI":["288738","532398"],"PO":["495796"]},"46586":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>EEC-9980291<br\/>SNYDER<br\/><br\/>This continuing award funds the multi-university Industry\/University Cooperative Research Center (I\/UCRC) for Advanced Computing and Communications for a second five-year period (in accordance with Announcement 97-164).

This abundance of data demands new and highly accurate computational analysis tools to explore these sequences and maximize the scientific knowledge gained from them. This interdisciplinary project combines the latest techniques in data modeling and data mining with knowledge of molecular biology to find genes and other scientifically significant patterns in DNA sequence databases. The Glimmer system uses Interpolated Markov Models (IMMs) to finding genes in microbial genomes. This tremendously successful system has found over 98% of the genes in the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, syphilis, tuberculosis, and others. This project is developing new systems to find genes in the much more complex DNA of higher organisms, and at the same time advancing the state of the art for the underlying IMM technology. Specific foci of the project include: developing improved probabilistic models for gene finding; developing algorithmic methods for identifying laterally transferred genes and other unusual DNA sequences; and developing IMMs and other probabilistic techniques for analyzing DNA in higher organisms including plants and mammals. This project will dramatically improve our ability to discover genes and other biologically significant features in a wide range of organisms, leading to the development of new antibiotics and vaccines and to a better understanding of how DNA directs the functions of a living cell.

Simulation remains the method of choice for network<br\/>designers, researchers, and managers for many analysis problems. However, modern simulation<br\/>tools are typically limited to analyzing tens to hundreds of network nodes, while studies of<br\/>current and future networks such as the next generation Internet call for analyses of thousands to<br\/>millions. New, practical approaches to network modeling and simulation are needed to address<br\/>this growing problem.<br\/> Two frequently heard problems with simulation technology today are (1) the excessive amount<br\/>of time required to construct a model for a large network, and (2) the inordinate amount of<br\/>computer time required to execute the resulting simulation program. This project, called<br\/>COMPASS (COMposable and PArallel Simulation of internetworkS), will attack the first<br\/>problem by defining and realizing an approach to enable rapid construction of network models<br\/>by reusing model components developed by others, possibly using different simulation software<br\/>packages. The second problem will be attacked through execution of the model on parallel<br\/>and\/or distributed computers. In this regard, this project will focus on realizing a practical,<br\/>flexible, approach to parallelization that can be widely exploited by the networking community.<br\/>This approach, based on composing (federating) autonomous simulators executing on different<br\/>processors, cleanly separates the parallel and sequential portions of the simulation, allowing<br\/>concurrent optimization and refinement of each. A related problem that will be studied concerns<br\/>execution of models over a geographically distributed area in situations where model<br\/>components cannot be easily co-located.<br\/> To demonstrate this approach, an optimized parallel\/distributed implementation of the ns2<br\/>simulator will be realized as part of this project.

The VRD has full color and a broad luminance range for high contrast, even in bright ambient daylight; the mechanism will eventually be miniaturized to fit on a spectacle frame, making wearable displays feasible. Because of these attributes, and the fact that VRD parameters can be configured in various combinations to alter characteristics of the perceived image such as field of view, resolution and the size of the scanning aperture, the VRD holds great promise for enhancing vision in the partially sighted. The goal of this research is to investigate how best to realize this promise. The small exit pupil of the VRD allows clear images to be seen by users with corneal distortions and\/or partial opacities of the lens such as cataracts. For central retinal diseases such as macular degeneration, the VRD can be configured to direct high contrast, large feature images to the peripheral retina. For peripheral disorders, where only a small central area may remain functional, the display can be configured with a high-resolution narrow field of view. Pilot tests of subjects with partial loss of vision indicate that even non-optimized images from the VRD can usually be seen better than CRT images. The PIs will conduct psychophysical visual testing with partially sighted users, and systematic comparison with standard computer displays (CRTs and LCDs), to determine for a variety of visual disorders the appropriate VRD scanning and modulation characteristics for optimal image resolution, contrast sensitivity, color perception and absence of flicker. The ability of users to view text, see video images and use common computer applications such as word processors, spreadsheets, and web browsers will also be assessed.

The goals of the proposed research are to address the issues related to the design of future optical networks. In particular, the design of scalable architectures and algorithms to manage, control, and deliver the required level of service efficiently is the primary goal. The proposal is based on the use of optical fiber technology, wavelength division multiplexing, wavelength conversion, and wavelength sharing. The objective is to develop solutions that will support a contract between source, destination, and network, and allow the use of gigabit bandwidths for user applications. The proposal is based on the sharing of a limited number of wavelengths among multiple users, the utilization of limited wavelength conversion capability in the network, and the use of multi-fiber links to support loss- and conflict-free communication for individual users by allocating dedicated resources to each connection. Specifically, the following research issues will be addressed. The balance between the minimum granularity of allocatable resources that can be supported by the available technology of WDM, wavelength sharing, wavelength conversion, multi-fiber links, and user needs will be indentified. Using this information base, new architectures and corresponding algorithms for resource allocation policies that efficiently utilize network resources will be developed. The architectural solutions will include spare capacity to tolerate single-fiber failures. When wavelength sharing is employed, different sources may transmit in a controlled manner such that they achieve their average rates. However, depending on the sharing mechanism, delay may be an important factor. Minimizing session blocking probabilities and delays in data delivery are the main issues in setting up session requests. An aim of this proposal is to develop effective solutions for this problem. Distributed routing algorithms that minimize both of these metrics in setting up an end-to-end request will be developed and evaluated. The results of the proposed research are expected to make significant advances towards the use of WDM-based all-optical technology. The initial approach to solve the proposed problems is to evaluate the proposed architectures using analytical models and simulations. The results of the initial studies will be used in developing alternative architectures and sophisticated routing algorithms.","title":"Collaborative Research: Exploring Architectures and Algorithms for Optical Networks","awardID":"9973111","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["564881"],"PO":["234222"]},"39777":{"abstract":"Determining a structure preserving reduced rank approximation to a given structured matrix has many important applications such as signal processing, image processing, system identification, and control <br\/>processes.

It broadly examines exploiting prediction and speculation, heretofore limited to processor cores, in processors, memory, and the interactions between them. A driving focus of the work is multicast snooping, a new cache coherence approach that uses prediction to both increase effective bandwidth over a classical symmetric multiprocessor and reduce latency over a traditional directory-based system. Multicast snooping uses prediction to \"guess\" which processors have copies of a block and multicast address transactions<br\/>to those processors. A novel network organization combines simultaneous multicasts to disjoint multicast sets while still providing ordering guarantees.

Such specifications focus on message exchanges among communicating entities in distributed software systems. Recent standardization of syntax and semantics (MSC'96 or Z.120) by ITU and integration into modern object-oriented software engineering methodologies such as UML, lead us to believe that scenario-based specifications will play an increasingly important role in design of concurrent systems. This research aims to develop new language features, methodologies, analysis techniques, and tools for effective use of scenario-based requirements in software design. We propose to pursue two complementary research directions. The first goal is to develop new techniques to employ scenario-based requirements for automatic validation. For this purpose, we will develop algorithms for model checking and test-case generation based on specifications given by message sequence charts. The second goal is to develop new constructs to allow specification of complex behaviors. For this purpose, we will investigate constructors that are particularly suitable for abstraction, and for specification of mixed discrete-continuous behaviors. We propose to investigate foundational research questions related to the above issues, and develop an integrated toolkit for specification, analysis, and testing of scenario-based requirements.","title":"Specification, Analysis, and Testing of Scenario-Based Requirements","awardID":"9970925","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2004-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}}],"PIcoPI":["497082"],"PO":["564388"]},"45563":{"abstract":"EIA-9974979<br\/>Javier Arroyo-Figueroa<br\/>University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez<br\/><br\/>Next Generation Software: ERF: An Event-Rule Framework for Supporting Heterogeneous Distributed Systems <br\/><br\/>This proposal presents a plan for research and development of an Event-Rule framework (ERF) which comprises of a set of services and tools for supporting the development of heterogeneous distributed systems (HDS).

What kinds of signaling must they use? What role if any, do currents, vortices, or other local environmental disturbances play in this process? Are there universal principles of coordinated group motion and if so what might they be? How might they be used to design a school of autonomous submerged vehicles, or a group of ground-based or airborne mobile robots to collectively accomplish a useful task in a coordinated manner? In broad terms, these are the questions to which this research will be addressed.<br\/><br\/>More specifically, we propose to mount a cross-disciplinary assault on the joint problems of understanding how fish schools coordinate their collective motion and how schools of autonomous submerged vehicles might be designed to move in a coordinated manner. We propose to address these problems experimentally, theoretically and by means of computer simulation. At the theoretical level, our aims will be to develop models, which are biologically plausible, and, in addition, operating strategies will enable coordinated group motion of engineered systems. Our ultimate goal is not to derive analytical models nor to develop computer simulations, which are visually satisfactory, but rather to discover the underlying concepts upon which the coordination of group motion might depend. Thus, for example we would hope to develop concepts which, on the one hand might help to explain how fish maintain their spacing and, on the other might serve as guidelines for the design of groupings of man-made autonomous vehicles of all types.<br\/><br\/>The experimental thrust of this research will proceed in two distinct but parallel directions. With the objective of gathering the world's first data-base documenting the long-term, three-dimensional motions of individual fish within a large school, we will take timed sequences of stereo video images of actual fish schools living in a large {1000 gallon or more} tank. We will image the responses of schools to various stimuli and under various conditions. Using advanced image\/vision processing techniques, we will transform this data into a form suitable for verifying the validity of proposed behavioral and analytical schooling models. This database together with full documentation will be made available to the science and engineering communities via the World Wide Web.<br\/><br\/>With the objective of trying out candidate group coordination strategies in a reasonably realistic setting, we will develop an experimental test facility consisting of a school of approximately a dozen, identical miniature underwater vehicles. These experiments are expected to be useful for both the biological and the engineering perspectives; we will be able to test robotic versions of hypothesized biology models not possible in a fish tank. Experiments with this man-made school will be carried out in an Olympic-sized swimming pool, which is available at Princeton University. Our first goal will be to instrument these vehicles so that they can function autonomously, without remote control. We will then experiment with a variety of maneuvers including group formation, cruising, bifurcating, avoiding obstacles, and changing group shapes. We will implement various biologically inspired goal-seeking strategies such as foraging as well as gradient climbing tasks relevant both to biology and to numerous engineering applications.<br\/><br\/>The research we are proposing will be carried out by a cross-disciplinary team consisting of experimental and theoretical biologists together with experts in computer vision, control systems and robotics. It is our view that by means of this multi-pronged assault consisting of theoretical analysis, computer simulation, and experimentation with both natural and man-made groups, we can attain an understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing the coordinated motion of natural and man-made groups.","title":"KDI: Coordinated Motion of Natural and Man-Made Groups","awardID":"9980058","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2004-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"8877","name":"KDI-COMPETITION"}}],"PIcoPI":["27602","323756","519250","355639","552050"],"PO":["564898"]},"36510":{"abstract":"Abstract<br\/><br\/>IIS-9820709<br\/>Wen, John<br\/>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute<br\/>$64,414 - 12 mos.<br\/><br\/>Analysis, Synthesis and Control for General Parallel Robotic Systems<br\/><br\/>This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award.

Existing methodologies for the design and management of wireless network resources are grossly inadequate for dealing with the demands projected for future networks that will need to deliver high-quality voice and multimedia services to large numbers of mobile subscribers.

These include time-varying multipath, inter-user interference, and extra-network interference. Spatial diversity is among the most important mechanisms within wireless networks for effective interference management, and this investigation stresses use of this form of diversity in a globally efficient manner. Several specific and interrelated research themes are under study. These include the design and exploitation of \"virtual arrays\" that combine physical resources across cellular boundaries to enhance overall network performance, the management (i.e., the control and allocation) of interference, and the creation and exploitation of content-specific characteristics in multimedia traffic (primarily through space-time coding) for the enhancement of overall network throughput.

The central problem in propositional proof complexity is to understand which tautologies have efficient proofs in standard proof systems. There are many interconnections between these two lines of research, and in the last decade exciting new results have been obtained by combining and mixing ideas from both fields. The overall aim of this research project is to make progress in both of these areas (circuit complexity and proof complexity) with emphasis on proving lower bounds for propositional proof systems. A focus is the complexity of algebraic proof systems: these are natural proof systems derived from the Grobner basis algorithm. To illustrate their fundamental nature, there have already been several applications of algebraic lower bounds, including lower bounds for NP-search problems, lower bounds for bounded depth Frege proofs, and new algorithms for satisfiability testing. Related problems investigated include: the complexity of random formulas, the proof-theoretic strength required to resolve the P=?NP question, and connections to algebraic circuit lower bounds.<br\/><br\/>A complementary facet of the theoretical work described above is to build good algorithms for satisfiability testing. There has been an increasing trend to solve many problems, particular in AI domains, with heuristics for satisfiability. These algorithms are typically variations of standard proof search methods (i.e., randomized versions of resolution) and perform quite well empirically. However, almost no analytical results are known as to how, why and under which conditions the heuristics work well. A goal of this research is to provide analytical results that are meaningful, and to develop new algorithms for SAT and SSAT (stochastic SAT) that improve upon existing state-of-the-art algorithms.","title":"Studies in Proof Complexity and Circuit Complexity","awardID":"9820831","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[92118],"PO":["279077"]},"35345":{"abstract":"Abstract <br\/><br\/>IIS-9817432 <br\/>Smith, Terence <br\/>University of California, Santa Barbara <br\/>$1,080,000 - 12 mos.<br\/><br\/>DLI Phase 2: Alexandria Digital Earth Prototype<br\/><br\/>This is the first year funding of a five year Cooperative Agreement award.

This will allow users to routinely perform simulations of such phenomena as cometary x-ray emission, the Earth's magnetosphere, and coronal mass ejections on current and future generations of massively parallel computer architectures. These MHD simulations are performed by block-based hierarchical adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) techniques for which the investigators have developed a highly efficient parallel implementation. Future applications to resistive MHD, however, require a more sophisticated time integration procedure to effectively deal with the large disparities of time scale associated with convection, magnetosonic and Alfven waves, and thermal transport. The researchers will investigate parallel implementations of both implicit Newton-Krylov-Schwarz (NKS) and full approximate storage (FAS) multigrid strategies in this context. In summary, the combination of robust finite-volume discretization of the governing equations, block-based AMR, domain decomposition, and parallel implementation of implicit NKS and\/or multigrid strategies should yield an efficient, reliable, and powerful numerical method for large-scale simulation of MHD flows on high-performance parallel machines. Moreover, the resulting method should represent a significant improvement over the current generation of space plasma simulation tools and permit the study of a wider class of problems.","title":"Parallel Implicit Solution-Adaptive Schemes for Space Weather and Geospace Environmental Modeling","awardID":"9876943","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4080","name":"ADVANCED COMP RESEARCH PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"06","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES             ","abbr":"GEO"},"div":{"id":"0604","name":"Division of OCEAN SCIENCES","abbr":"OCE"},"pgm":{"id":"1523","name":"SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0707","name":"Division of INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION & PARTNE","abbr":"IIP"},"pgm":{"id":"5750","name":"MAGNETOSPHERIC PHYSICS"}}],"PIcoPI":[98087,98088],"PO":["551992"]},"58467":{"abstract":"","title":"The Back of an Envelope: An Architecture for Knowledge Based Design Environment","awardID":"0096138","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2001-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6845","name":"HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["538656"],"PO":["565227"]},"36577":{"abstract":"This award supports a workshop that will foster interdisciplinary collaboration between two scientific communities -- economics and multi-agent systems.

The research is to investigate analytically and experimentally into problems of workpiece fixturing and related problems of object gripping. Prior efforts in automated fixture planning have largely been based on rigid-body models or ad-hoc models of compliant contact. These models are too inaccurate for manufacturing operations that involve large forces and precision deflection tolerances. The first goal of this research is to extend work on compliant contact modelling to include other important contact phenomena, such as the effect of friction in nonlinearly compliant contacts, and global deformations in workpieces with slender internal structures. Further, the PI plans to integrate the<br\/>relevant contact phenomena into a single effectively computable model. A second major goal is to construct a comprehensive experimental system that will be the first to measure the complete range of physical phenomena underlying the fixturing problem. These experiments should not only validate and refine the models, but also help convince the community of fixturing researchers and practitioners that nonlinear compliance models are to be preferred over currently used ad-hoc models. A third goal is to develop automated fixturing and gripping synthesis procedures that are based on the extended models. These algorithms will be able to automatically generate fixture arrangements that guarantee meaningful performance criteria, such as deflection tolerance, in the presence of externally applied loads. The PI also wishes to include design parameters, such as surface curvature and the minimal number of fixtures needed to guarantee task<br\/>performance criteria, that have not previously been addressed in the fixture synthesis literature. In the long term, the PI's team plan to use these results to study active control of the fixture loading process so as to inherently ensure accurate part localization. Since fixturing is closely related to gripping, these results should have a longer-term impact on the deployment of more sophisticated gripping devices.","title":"Experiments, Modeling, and Automatic Planning for Fixturing and Gripping","awardID":"9901056","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["301111"],"PO":["234178"]},"38348":{"abstract":"This research involves a heretofore unsolved signal reconstruction problem called phase retrieval. A signal--such as an electrocardiogram, an image, or video--can be represented in terms of magnitude and phase information.

The objective of this research is to further develop new multiresolution-based phase retrieval methods and to transfer them directly into practice and into the engineering classroom. The principal investigator is also applying these multiresolution-based techniques to image compression--an essential technology for wireless communications, digital image libraries, multimedia over the Internet, etc. Furthermore, the educational initiatives of this research include: incorporating research-based projects into undergraduate and graduate courses; utilizing collaborative learning and web-based teaching tools; and, conducting activities designed to recruit and retain women in engineering. <br\/><br\/>Phase retrieval has important applications in several areas of engineering and applied physics, such as: antenna design, astronomy, instrumentation design, electron microscopy, and x-ray crystallography.

However, the phase information is necessary for reconstructing the transmitting antenna's aperture field distribution. Thus, the reconstruction of phase from only the measured magnitude information enables potentially low cost antenna measurements. This research extends the investigator's new phase retrieval methods that provide solutions to previously unsolvable problems through their novel multiresolution approach.

Moreover, it introduces the powerful tools of fractals, chaos and non-linear systems for additional applications, like forecasting, time-sequence data mining, buffering and prefetching, for large database applications. Typical questions can be as diverse as: \"In a real set of points, like cities of the world, estimate the average number of neighbors within 10 miles from New York city\" in a GIS (Geographic Information System) setting, and \"Given the history of past disk page requests, what can we forecast for future requests\" in a disk scheduling setting. Deriving estimated answers to such questions is notoriously hard, because of the non-uniformities that real datasets exhibit. Although unrealistic, the uniformity and independence assumptions have been traditionally used in past efforts, mainly because of their mathematical tractability and because of the lack of anything better. The current project proposes to replace them with the assumption of self-similarity, leading to much more accurate estimates. Current estimates with the uniformity assumption lead to up to 179 per cent error; with fractals, we expect the error to go down to 10 per cent or less.

In the Bio-Networking Architecture, services and applications are implemented by a collection of multiple entities called cyberentities (as a bee colony consists of multiple bees). These cyberentities have functionality related to their service or application and follow simple behavior rules (e.g., migration, reproduction, energy exchange, mutation, death) similar to biological entities. In the Bio-Networking Architecture, useful emergent behaviors (e.g., adaptation, evolution, security, and survivability) result when individual cyberentities interact.

Construction of the service or application is<br\/> simplified because only relatively simple behaviors at the cyberentity level<br\/> need to be designed.

Until recently, the approach for service differentiation in the Internet has focused on providing QoS guarantees to individual traffic flows. This per-flow model has not been widely embraced, largely due to the vast amount of state information that needs to be maintained in the network. As a consequence, the network community is currently redefining the notion <br\/>of QoS for the Internet, leading to a new service model where guarantees are made to appropriate flows, rather than to individual flows.<br\/><br\/>The notions of aggregate QoS which are being defined, e.g., by the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) working group in the IETF, are very different from traditional networking concepts and require novel <br\/>algorithms for traffic control and provisioning. The objective of the proposed research is to give fundamental insights into the nature and delivery of QoS to traffic aggregates, henceforth called aggregate QoS.<br\/><br\/>A central feature of service models for aggregate QoS is that there is no requirement for users to specify the composition or the destination of traffic. This significantly complicates the provisioning of network resources and suggests that new, feedback-intensive traffic control algorithms must be developed to <br\/>mitigate uncertainty about network loading. At present there is little or no theory available to guide the development of such algorithms.

The success of model checking procedures rely on the efficiency of the data structures used to represent the states of the system. In this project a composite model will be developed for combining multiple type-specific representations so that all variable types can be represented efficiently during the state space search.

Multiparty<br\/>communication refers to any type of information exchange among a group of participants, including<br\/>conferences, advertising, electronic voting, remote monitoring, and meta-computing.<br\/>Multicast, or one-to-many communication, has received the most attention from network proto-<br\/>col designers and has been implemented on a subset of the Internet known as the MBone. Several<br\/>obstacles to the universal deployment of multicast remain, such as high cost and lack of robustness.<br\/>Moreover, some multiparty applications are not able to operate, or operate less efficiently, because<br\/>multicast is a poor match for their style of communication. Large-scale electronic voting, for exam-<br\/>ple, could use a many-to-one network service, with balloting results partially tabulated on the way<br\/>to a central reporting service.<br\/> Research from the fields of graph theory and parallel and distributed computing has solved many<br\/>of these problems, albeit for environments that differ greatly from that of the Internet. The key to<br\/>applying these results to Internet protocols is the use of a virtual topology that maps a theoretical<br\/>substructure onto the physical network. As with the MBone, the links in the virtual topology could<br\/>consist of some physical links and some virtual links implemented by encapsulation tunnels.<br\/>The proposed research first addresses limitations in current multicast routing protocols. The researchers<br\/>propose to investigate the use of spanners as a virtual topology for densely-populated multicast<br\/>groups, thus improving the efficiency of the periodic ooding used in this domain. For sparsely-<br\/>populated groups, we propose to apply hypercube message passing algorithms used in parallel<br\/>computation to the design of a more efficient and fault-tolerant multicast protocol. The researchers then plan<br\/>to apply the techniques used for multicast virtual topologies to other multiparty communication<br\/>paradigms. The researchers have identified promising research directions for reduction (many-to-one), subcast (one-to-some), and multi-source multicast (few-to-many).<br\/> The project will progress in three main stages: analysis, protocol design and evaluation. The<br\/>analysis stage is intended to identify virtual topologies that are good candidates for multiparty com-<br\/>munication protocols. The analysis will include definition of formal models of the virtual topologies<br\/>used, definition of appropriate metrics and statistical evaluation of random samples of the topologies,<br\/>and discussion of complexity status of the relevant exact and approximate optimization problems.<br\/>The protocol design stage will build on our analysis by using virtual topologies as the basis for<br\/>communication protocols. Our emphasis will be on protocols that are feasible and practical to<br\/>implement and will be based on simulation studies of the static properties of proposed graph struc-<br\/>tures. Evaluation of the new protocols will utilize dynamic simulation to look at traffic capacities,<br\/>delay, and fault tolerance recovery. Eventually, the developed protocols will be implemented and<br\/>evaluated on a network testbed built with prior NSF support.<br\/> The major contributions of this work will be a methodology for applying virtual topologies to<br\/>Internet protocol design, formal models for these topologies, and new protocols for multicast rout-<br\/>ing, reduction, and other communication paradigms. Further outcomes of our work will include<br\/>a database of topologies used in our simulations, methods for modeling dynamic group member-<br\/>ship and group distribution, and techniques for evaluation of fault tolerance properties of virtual<br\/>topologies and protocols. The contributions to education will consist of training of graduate and<br\/>undergraduate students in network theory and engineering, and development and dissemination of<br\/>curriculum materials for the design and evaluation of multiparty communication protocols.","title":"Virtual Topologies for Multiparty Communication","awardID":"9977524","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2004-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["343534",117139,"343535","410042"],"PO":["292741"]},"35357":{"abstract":"Abstract <br\/><br\/>IIS-9817527 <br\/>Myers, Brad <br\/>Carnegie Mellon University<br\/>$150,000 - 12 mos.<br\/><br\/>Using the Informedia Digital Video Library to Author Multimedia Material <br\/><br\/>This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award.

The PIs' previous work has established that speakers are more likely to delete certain sounds (e.g., the final \"t\" in \"about\") in a variety of situations: if the next word starts with certain consonants; if they are speaking quickly; if the word is unsurprising (has a high trigram probability); if they are young and male; if the word is not followed by a pause or a word-repetition; or if they are speakers of certain dialects. They have further shown how confidence metrics can be used to identify inaccurate dictionary pronunciations based on actual pronunciations in speech. This project will extend and combine both of these lines of research, by using phonetic-confidence models to identify words with incorrect pronunciations that contribute to word-error, and then building statistical (decision-tree) models of pronunciation variation for these words. The PIs' model provides a general engine which they will apply to several specific classes of pronunciation variation, including dialect and speaker type, embedded in the Sphinx-II speech recognizer. The application of computational models to the study of pronunciation variation is an important new research area in linguistics and cognitive modeling, with implications for and potential benefits to many areas of science and pedagogy, including universal access.","title":"Modeling Pronunciation Variation for Universal Access to Speech Understanding","awardID":"9978025","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2004-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6845","name":"HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"V083","name":"CIA-KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY TO NSF"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"W295","name":"CIA-KNOWLEDGE DISC & DISSEMIN"}}],"PIcoPI":["551123","517444",117703],"PO":["246649"]},"39757":{"abstract":"The data structure that is frequently used in image processing is based upon the Euclidean Fourier analysis and lacks projectively covariant characteristics.

This harmonic analysis is well-suited for developing algorithms for storing and processing visual information that can be used in automated systems for pattern recognition independent of different perspectives between planar objects (i.e., patterns) and the imaging systems. In particular, the analysis allows reconstruction of any perspective distortions of a pattern by using only the projective Fourier transform in the noncompact picture of the original (undistorted) pattern, which was demonstrated in numerical tests. Moreover, the convolutions in both pictures can be used to develop algorithms for projectively-invariant matching of patterns.<br\/><br\/>This project will develop<br\/>- a fast algorithm for rendering any perspective distortions of a pattern using efficiently computed projective Fourier transforms in the non-compact picture of the original pattern; and<br\/>- a fast algorithm for computing projective Fourier transform in the compact picture.<br\/><br\/>Algorithms for efficient computation of the convolutions in noncompact and compact pictures would follow from the both fast projective transforms and their inverses.","title":"Computing Projective Fourier Transforms and Rendering Projective Distortions of Patterns","awardID":"9901957","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":[100808],"PO":["179846"]},"42793":{"abstract":"The objectives of this conference, jointly sponsored by the IEEE Communications Society, IEEE Region 8 (Europe, Middle East, Africa), and the Russian Popov Society, are to communicate to the most current knowledge about Internet technologies and services, and stimulate information exchange and collaboration among members of the Internet technical communities Russia, Europe as a whole, and North America.

Since I\/O resources belong to the slowest level of memory hierarchy, their efficient management becomes critical for high performance.<br\/><br\/>The proposed research focuses on the development of an allocation framework that integrates the management of computational and I\/O resources in parallel systems. This research is facilitated, firstly, by previously obtained quantitative data on the processing and I\/O requirements of parallel scientific applications. Additionally, recent studies on processor scheduling that explicitly consider the I\/O demands of parallel scientific applications demonstrate performance trends that differ significantly from previously observed trends where only processor allocation is considered.<br\/><br\/>The proposed plan considers a systematic exploration of coordinated allocation strategies of both processor and I\/O resources and investigates issues that have not been addressed in traditional processor scheduling or I\/O research in parallel systems. The primary objectives of this project are: 1) the development of an analytic model that effectively captures the scalability of I\/O intensive applications under different data distributions on the disks and under different assignment of computational resources, 2) the analysis of the relative advantages and disadvantages of new dual resource allocation strategies through modeling and experimental measurements, and 3) the development of a unified framework that allows the processor scheduler and the parallel file system to operate jointly towards the common goal of sharing the parallel resources amoung the various executing applications in order to maximize overall system performance. The proposed work will be experimentally verified on a variety of parallel platforms and the dual resource allocation algorithms will be implemented so as to ensure their portability across these platforms.","title":"Next Generation Software: Coordinated Allocation of Processor and I\/O Resources in Parallel Systems","awardID":"9974992","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2004-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"4080","name":"ADVANCED COMP RESEARCH PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2884","name":"NEXT GENERATION SOFTWARE PROGR"}}],"PIcoPI":["518455"],"PO":["301532"]},"46435":{"abstract":"9979448<br\/>Van Veen<br\/><br\/>An integrated program of research is proposed for exploiting all available modes of diversity in the wireless channel. This requires the development of novel antennas for transmitting in diverse modes, digital receivers for exploiting these modes, and dynamic resources allocations for assigning them. <br\/><br\/>The primary challenges in this research are to manage and exploit the complex and time varying nature of the wireless communication channel, while meeting the power and bandwidth constraints of mobiles, base stations and networks. Hence, the work emphasizes integration of digital receivers for multiaccess communication with smart antennas and dynamic resource allocation. The smart antenna excites the temporal, spatial, and polarizational modes in the wireless channel. The multiuse receiver uses these modes to decode mobile users and to estimate channel parameters, which are used by the dynamic resource allocator to provide the required QoS to end users.<br\/><br\/>The design of a high frequency (e.g., 30 Ghz), high bandwidth radiating and receiving antenna which is agile in space, time, and polarization will involve numerical modeling, device construction, and testing of a prototype, based on prior experience with millimeter wave lens antennas. The design of multiaccess receivers which exploit available degrees of freedom will be based on actual device characteristics and on realistic scattering models for the channel. These receivers will be designed and implemented in reduced dimension subspaces. These subspaces are generated by resolving the real channel into a parallel combination of virtual diversity channels, using a special canonical space-time coordinate system. The designs will be evaluated using the software radio testbed currently under development at Eurecom.. The innovative aspect of the proposed dynamic network allocation work is the shared use of information at the physical and network layers to jointly optimize the use of channel and network resources for ensuring QoS. Dynamic resource allocation will exploit all the channel modes made available by the antennas and receivers. Estimates of signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and bit error rate (BER) will be shared between the physical and network layers to dynamically allocate power and bandwidth across different channel modes, while keeping signaling and receiver complexity manageable. This integrated research program will influence the conception, development, and implementation of future wireless communication networks.<br\/><br\/>A key element of this project is the integration of student and faculty research activities at three universities: the University of Wisconsin, the University of Colorado, and Eurecom in France, the later a recipient of an IEEE Education Award for its innovative integration of mobile wireless, multimedia, and networking. The likelihood of success I this collaborative program is high, because working relationships between the three schools have been established through prior visits, sabbaticals, and collaborations.<br\/><br\/>The management plan is built around regular visits between laboratories at the participating schools, and joint advising of students working at technology boundaries. The integrated perspective developed in this research program will be incorporated into a new undergraduate wireless communication laboratory, a graduate colloquium course, and a wireless communication reading course.

This project is developing new techniques for processing database triggers that are fast and can support many times more triggers than can be handled now. Current database trigger processing systems are synchronous. In other words, triggers run inside the same transactions that are updating the data. This project is developing scalable trigger processing capability in a number of ways, including: (1) testing trigger conditions and running trigger actions after database update transactions complete; (2) developing special algorithms and data structures for fast trigger condition checking; (3) applying parallel processing on shared-memory multiprocessor computers to test trigger conditions and run trigger actions more quickly; and (4) developing a timer-driven trigger capability that checks trigger conditions periodically rather than after each update.

TriggerMan is being implemented as an extension module to a commercial, object-relational database management system, a driver program, and an application programming interface library.

The PI addresses the problem of manipulating an object using a succession of contacts with simple robotic devices that may have discrete or continuous degrees of freedom. The problem of planning the overall object trajectory is reduced to constructing a sequence of atomic robot motions between equilibrium states of the system. The proposed approach is based on constructing the capture region of each equilibrium, i.e., the maximal subset of the object's configuration<br\/>space such that any motion starting within this subset is guaranteed to end up in the equilibrium configuration. In particular, contact is not assumed to maintain during the execution of the manipulation task; nor is there any attempt to predict the object motion between equilibria. This approach will be applied to three problems: (1) grasping and in-hand manipulation in the presence of frictional effects and large position uncertainties, (2) motion planning for mobile robots pushing an object while avoiding obstacles, and (3) re-orienting parts by dropping them on a simple mechanism reminiscent of Pachinko machines. Progress will be assessed by conducting experiments with actual robotic devices, including four Nomadic Super Scout II mobile robots and prototypes of the reconfigurable gripper and of the proposed Pachinko machine developed at the University of Illinois. The main applications of the proposed research are in manufacturing, including part feeding and industrial assembly.

The techniques developed in this research result in a new framework for the virtual discovery of new pharmaceuticals or materials. The basic idea is to utilize large existing pharmaceutical databases as input for a new type of structure\/activity correlation methodology in order to calculate a large set of new and traditional descriptors to create improved Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models that characterize and predict important biological responses. Once the descriptors have been determined and a predictive model has been built, thousands of new potential molecules, chemically similar to those of the benchmark data set, are scanned from large databases and are evaluated for their chemical properties based on the predictive model. The aim is to target a few novel molecules with potentially attractive pharmaceutical properties that can then be tested further in the traditional way in the laboratory. Computationally intelligent data mining techniques are vital to extract the information necessary to select these novel molecules. This research applied novel machine learning paradigms such as semi-supervised learning with capacity control. These algorithms predict desired biological responses and generate QSAR models using both known (labeled) and unknown (unlabeled) biological responses. This project involves the development of an infrastructure of computationally intelligent computer codes that allow for the virtual design of novel pharmaceuticals or the improvement of existing pharmaceuticals. The proposed methodology is applicable to most pharmaceuticals for which a database of responses is available. The ultimate pay-off of this methodology is expected to lead to the rapid invention of new drugs for new or known society threatening diseases where a very fast response is warranted.","title":"KDI: Automated Design and Discovery of Novel Pharmaceuticals using Semi-Supervised Learning in Large Molecular Databases","awardID":"9979860","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2004-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8877","name":"KDI-COMPETITION"}}],"PIcoPI":[118790,"421604","554109"],"PO":["563751"]},"44456":{"abstract":"9970980 Launchbury, John Oregon Graduate Institute<br\/>Multiple Interpretations of Domain-specific Languages<br\/><br\/>Recently, domain-specific languages (DSLs) have become a popular topic of research. Their promise is in their expressiveness. The programmer becomes concerned with specifying what computation is to be performed, and not with low level detail such as storage, or the order in which to perform computation. When a DSL is defined, the designer will have a primary interpretation in mind. For hardware description languages, for example, the primary interpretation may be a description of how individual gates and primitive circuits are to be wired together. However, DSLs also often have secondary interpretations. Again, a hardware description language may have simulators that provide it with a different semantics: an execution<br\/>semantics, which allow for testing circuits before they are committed to silicon. For these two distinct meanings to be useful, they must be coherent in some precise sense, perhaps expressed by a commuting diagram. This research investigates the principles and practice of multiple interpretations of DSLs. The expected outcomes include techniques for providing multiple coherent interpretations to DSLs; application of these techniques in the context of Hawk, a domain-specific language for specifying microprocessor microarchitectures; and a demonstration of the value of multiple interpretations by obtaining new results in microarchitecture verification.","title":"Multiple Interpretations of Domain-Specific Languages","awardID":"9970980","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2003-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}}],"PIcoPI":["133791"],"PO":["564388"]},"36624":{"abstract":"The PI will study practical algorithms for approximation and exact solutions of some network design problems such as finding a lowest cost. spanning subgraph of a weighted graph that provides k-connectivity between all nodes.

This throughput limitation must be overcome in order to meet the growing desire for instant information accessibility regardless of one's location around the world, sometimes referred to as \"global seamless roaming\". Until recently, it was believed that the primary obstacle to higher data rates in wireless systems was due to multipath -- the scattering of a signal along many different paths due to objects between the transmitter and receiver. However, remarkable new research suggests just the opposite; in particular, it has been demonstrated that if multiple antennas are used on both ends of a multipath-rich communications link, and appropriate digital \"space-time\" codes are employed, then dramatic increases in throughput can be achieved. Intuitively, this is because each propagation path offers a separate ``independent'' channel over which data can be transmitted. To take advantage of these spatially and temporally diverse channels, antenna arrays are required on both the receive and transmit ends of the link.

In future integrated services networks, congestion phenomena are likely to be quite different in nature than those in more traditional systems such as the Internet. The reason is that, at the cell level, the phenomena of long-range dependence and high variability are going to play a major role in the way we analyze, design and provide services over a network. While these phenomena have already been observed and statistically analyzed in existing systems, integration of services is expected to amplify them. The first part of the proposed research deals with<br\/>a further justification of the investigator's recent findings that explain how Levy processes arise as<br\/>macroscopic models of certain types of long-range dependent traffic. The justification is done by rigorously deriving macroscopic approximations of the probability distributions of the traffic processes. In addition, comparison with and further analysis and simulation of fractional Brownian motions is also proposed.<br\/>The investigator also proposes to explicitly study the consequences of these models (and, in particular Levy processes) to performance and control. He proposes to use sample path formulas and conservation laws in order to derive explicit solutions of solvable systems. Networks in tandem with stable-Levy motions inputs are promising candidates for explicit solvability. In the sequel, and in order to deal with non-solvable situations, he proposes to examine extremes of distributions and delays. The tasks involved here call for extensions of large deviations results and applications to networks with feedback. The impact of this study will be the understanding of the way that congestions occur in highly variable environments and will,<br\/>as in risk theory, help prevent catastrophes in networks. The proposed control methods involve stochastic<br\/>differential equations that can also be explained as arising from long-range dependent systems. By studying<br\/>optimal control problems, the investigator proposes to tackle buffer management schemes. Finally, he proposes to examine the impact of imposing deterministic or shaping regulatory constraints on stochastic traffic, derive worst-case scenaria and combine statistical and deterministic descriptors. The impact of this study will lead to further standardization of descriptors for next generation networks. Such descriptors<br\/>are invaluable for the provision of services and the design of correct pricing schemes.

They require tremendous resources including CPU, memory, storage, and audio\/visual devices, and they have substantially different characteristics, performance goals and system interactions than traditional scientific applications. For example, they have extremely irregular and unpredictable data access needs and workload distributions, they interact more dynamically and with many more types of input\/output sensors and devices, they involve dynamic user interaction and steering, and their goal is to deliver the best possible quality at a fixed output refresh rate rather than a solution of fixed quality in the minimum possible time. As computer architectures become more complex, it becomes increasingly difficult to develop such applications to achieve the desired performance. Three properties are critical: (i) high performance for rich interactive behavior, (ii) adaptability and isolation in all layers (i.e. the complexity, and unpredictability demand that each layer of application or system software must adapt to the layers above and below it-through performance modeling and through runtime feedback and adaptation-and should try to shield the neighboring layers from each other's complexity), and (iii) performance portability across component upgrades and across the different major types of platforms that may be used in such environments.

The regions of the program<br\/>representation that are changed by an improving transformation are<br\/>typically quite small.

The robot will emulate an animal foraging for resources while avoiding threats. Foraging search is a general-purpose search method applicable to finding sparse resources in a vast, dynamic and non-stationary environment. The specific approach to this problem involves learning causal relations between neutral cue stimuli and affective stimuli from resources (or<br\/>threats). In this study the PI will statistically evaluate learning efficacy as it effects success in finding resource objects in a large arena when those resources are movable and relations are non-stationary. Learning is based on a unique, multi-time scale learning mechanism, the adaptrode, which has previously been shown to solve the destructive<br\/>interference problem. In this problem, new knowledge may overwrite or interfere with previously learned knowledge. In non-stationary environments relations may change over time causing a learning system to eradicate knowledge of older relations. But, in such environments, the old relations might prove to be valid over longer time scales. With<br\/>destructive interference, the learner has to relearn what it had previously known. The adaptrode can maintain short-, intermediate- and long-term memories, even of contrary relations. The research project will involve at least three undergraduate students in all phases of the work.

It is a contention that the potential<br\/>for this trend to continue is almost unlimited, which suggests the question: what are the important properties for routers in the next generation Internet? The projects answer is a new router architecture, which they<br\/>call a general purpose router (GPR), that supports arbitrarily complex forwarding logic. The GPR architecture has six unique features:<br\/><br\/> Performance: Provides the throughput required by the next generation Internet.<br\/><br\/> Extensible: Easily extended to support new forwarding functions without compromising performance.<br\/><br\/> Scalable: Scales to relatively large sizes, on the order of a hundred of Gbps ports.<br\/><br\/> Open: The hardware and software should be open so anyone can build or extend a router.<br\/><br\/> Commodity Components: Implemented using commercially available components.<br\/><br\/> Robustness: Robust enough to tolerate programming mistakes and malicious attacks.<br\/><br\/>The bottom line is that the project recognizes a need for routers to move from being closed, special-purpose network devices to being open, general-purpose computing\/communication systems. The central challenge<br\/>in making this shift is to simultaneously support increasing complex forwarding logic and high performance, while using commercial hardware components and commercial operating systems. The GPR architecture<br\/>achieves this through two key innovations.<br\/><br\/> Better integration of the router's switching capacity and compute cycles.

Multimethods, as found in a few object-oriented languages, offer several advantages in uniformity, flexibility, reusability, and extensibility. However, multimethod in current languages suffer from several weaknesses compared to traditional object-oriented languages, including a lack of modular approaches to static typechecking, a lack of strong encapsulation mechanisms, and poorer run-time performance for message dispatching. This project seeks to solve these problems. A flexible model for<br\/>dispatching is being developed that subsumes single dispatching, multiple dispatching, and functions defined by pattern-matching, along with a classless object model and a static type system. A module system is being added to this base, to provide encapsulation and to define the units of separate static typechecking. New implementation techniques for efficient message dispatching are also being developed. To assess this research, the design is being embodied into both a small core language suitable for theoretical study (named Dubious) and an extended language suitable for practical programming (named Diesel), and the Vortex optimizing compiler infrastructure is being modified to include the new dispatching algorithms.","title":"Towards Practical, Expressive Multimethods","awardID":"9970986","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}}],"PIcoPI":["332082"],"PO":["397849"]},"46405":{"abstract":"First and second generation wireless networks have had a remarkable success in providing voice services with global coverage. Building on this success, third and fourth generation networks are envisioned with more emphasis on flexible data rather than voice services. Such an infrastructure will enable the implementation of advanced and diverse wireless services which are perhaps not yet imagined. One of the thorniest technical challenges in implementing high speed wireless data networks is that of multiplexing variable-bit-rate data users over the wireless channel. Classical solutions like TDMA, FDMA, or even CDMA are not appropriate, since they adhere to a connection-oriented, rather than packet-based, connectionless philosophy. Random access techniques on the other side offer the required flexibility, but suffer from severe throughput\/delay penalties under heavy traffic. In order to handle the anticipated diverse traffic mix, novel Medium Access (MAC) schemes have to be developed.

Existing methodologies for the design and management of wireless network resources are grossly inadequate for dealing with the demands projected for future networks that will need to deliver high-quality voice and multimedia services to large numbers of mobile subscribers. Thus, in providing a basis for significant improvement in network throughput and flexibility, the theory and methods developed under this study provide crucial elements for the development future generations of commercial communication networks.<br\/><br\/>This research is focused on the development of algorithms for dynamic, network-level, and content-specific management (i.e., allocation, control and mitigation) of the various forms of interference that ultimately and severely limit wireless network performance. These include time-varying multipath, inter-user interference, and extra-network interference. Spatial diversity is among the most important mechanisms within wireless networks for effective interference management, and this investigation stresses use of this form of diversity in a globally efficient manner. Several specific and interrelated research themes are under study. These include the design and exploitation of \"virtual arrays\" that combine physical resources across cellular boundaries to enhance overall network performance, the management (i.e., the control and allocation) of interference, and the creation and exploitation of content-specific characteristics in multimedia traffic (primarily through space-time coding) for the enhancement of overall network throughput.

New applications such as computer-supported cooperative work systems are appearing on these platforms, and parallel scientific and engineering computations have long used parallelism for high performance.

However, they often use intertwined and complicated protocols that make them difficult to build and reason about. This project studies structured approaches to managing this complexity, which view the system at different levels of abstraction and as parallel compositions of interacting components. The particular approach used to do this is the I\/O automaton model, which has previously been used to describe and verify distributed algorithms and distributed system designs. The model has a simple notion of external behavior based on linear traces of external actions of the components, and allows the components (automata) to be composed and related using simulation relations. The new research here will develop parts of the IOA programming language and toolset to support distributed and parallel programming using I\/O automata.

Although originally applied to hardware systems, finite-state verification (FSV) techniques (e.g. model checking) are emerging as the front-runner in the race to automate high-quality assurance of modern software.

The model and a property to be verified are given to a FSV tool, and verification is performed by mechanically enumerating all reachable states in the transition system and checking that the property holds at each state.

While archaic states have emerged in various parts of the world, the relative isolation of the valley has allowed the process of social evolution to be more visible there. To this end, extensive surveys of the valley have been made by the Oaxaca Settlement Survey in the 1970's and 1980's. The locations and features of over 3,000 archaeological sites have been documented. These data and the extracted knowledge are used here to construct a distributed, knowledge-based model of state formation in the valley. The model is then used to test various hypotheses concerning the emergence of complex social systems.

Our approaches rely on the use of Turbo coding and iterative decoding principles which were first introduced in 1993. Turbo codes are remarkable because they can operate very close to the channel capacity (a theoretical limit on the maximum data rate for reliablecommunication over a given channel). In this research, we are investigating the use of Turbo coding in conjunction with bandwidth-efficient modulation schemes that are suitable for satellite and land mobile radio communications. Such schemes make efficient use of the limited bandwidth resources, while at the same time allowing communication at very low power levels, thereby conserving the battery power in mobile and portable terminals. We are also investigating the application of Turbo codes to channels that exhibit time dispersion, such as wire-line channels used for voice band telephony and wireless channels used for cellular radio communications. We are devising new signaling schemes and receiver structures, and performance analysis tools when Turbo codes are used on these types of channels.<br\/><br\/>Many practical systems like mobile satellite communications and land mobile communications employ non-linear amplifiers at the receiver and, therefore, require a very small peak-to-average power ratio for the modulated signal. Continuous phase modulation (CPM) is an attractive technique for such systems<br\/>because of its constant envelope and compact power density spectrum. We are investigating the use of Turbo codes in combination with trellis coded modulation (TCM) and CPM. Our objective is to achieve large coding gains without bandwidth expansion and a constant envelope for the modulated signal,<br\/>making our schemes ideal for use in power and bandwidth limited communication systems. Also many physical channels exhibit inter-symbol interference (ISI), including static (wire-line telephone) ISI channels, and fading (cellular and PCS) ISI channels. It is important to devise techniques to either combat<br\/>the effects of ISI through efficient equalizer structures, or, mitigate the effects of ISI through the use of techniques like orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Recently, iterative equalization and decoding has been considered by some researchers and shown to provide large coding gains on static ISI channels. We are considering the application of Turbo codes to fading ISI channels and developing analytical tools to evaluate the performance of Turbo coding on ISI channels.

To overcome the long communication latencies associated with general purpose switches, it is proposed to combine the multithreading and communication co-processor capability. In this approach, each processor of a dual-processor PC has itself a dual role, acting both as a computation processor and a communication processor. Using software-enabled fine-grain multithreading, the duality of each processor allows the overlap of computation with communication, thus masking the long communication. The proposed architecture is designed to provide performance scalability and cost scalability. The principal result of the proposed research will be a cluster of PCs which can be used either as a powerful parallel computer to provide capabilities for computational science and engineering problems, or as a stable, scalable Web server as would be suitable for electronic commerce, and which at the same time can be used as a desktop computer for daily computing needs.","title":"MRI: A PC-based Multithreading Environment for Solving Grand Computational Problems in Science and Engineering","awardID":"9977508","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1189","name":"MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION"}}],"PIcoPI":[117117,117118,117119,117120,"225459"],"PO":["557609"]},"46505":{"abstract":"EIA 9979833<br\/>Kurose, James F.<br\/>Univ of Massachusetts, Amherst<br\/><br\/>CISE Educational Innovation: Creating a flexible undergraduate program in computer science: curriculum, educational technology and pedagogy<br\/><br\/>This CISE Educational Innovation project provides funds to develop a new undergraduate curriculum that facilitates rapid inclusion of research, incorporates advances in educational technology, and encourages innovation in teaching and in student learning.

The project aims to develop the theoretical basis of view management based on the notion of value order functions that imposes an order among a number of stored views. Value order functions can be defined by users employing a declarative language based on various properties of stored views. In this project, a prototype view management system is developed, called CAVES. It integrates view use and management functionalities into a single module with the help of two interconnected agents. The view use agent allows programmers to link view re-use methods to a database that helps CAVES maintain various statistics about the stored views. The view management agent applies general value ordering rules and optimization functions to this database to decide which views should be kept in storage. The effectiveness of different storage management policies and the performance of the system are tested with the help of a simulation model built on top of a high-performance parallel discrete-event simulation executive. The CAVES system will be used to improve the response time of client-server database systems by storing views that are computationally expensive or have high data shipping requirements at a client machine. The system will demonstrate that a dynamic collection of storage management protocols can outperform any static caching policy.

Essentially,<br\/>stratified systems are systems which can have multiple physical contacts (such as robotic hands or legged robotic locomotion), which results in a generic structure characterizing the configuration space for the robot. This generic structure can be exploited for control purposes. This project will implement coordinated manipulation of objects by multiple robotic manipulators allowing for intermittent engagement of the objects by some or all of the manipulators. The novelty of the approach is that it is formulated in sufficient mathematical generality so that the control algorithms are applicable to a broad class of objects to be manipulated. The PI has previously developed motion planning algorithms for stratified systems; however, they are fundamentally open loop. Because of the difficulty of accurately modeling the mechanics of a manipulator engaging or disengaging an object, very fine and precise motion will be difficult with a purely open loop control methodology. Also, because of the highly nonlinear nature of stratified systems, small initial errors in motion will tend to grow with time making accurate large scale motions difficult as well. The goals of the experiments are to determine the practical extent and nature of these difficulties and to incorporate sensory information<br\/>(both vision and contact sensors) in a discrete feedback control sense to improve the effectiveness of the stratified control methodology. Additionally, adaptive control methodologies will be used to supplement the stratified motion planning algorithms to enhance their robustness.","title":"REU: SGER: Stratified Robotic Manipulation Experimental Platform","awardID":"9910602","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2000-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["161696"],"PO":["475621"]},"45957":{"abstract":"EIA-9977387<br\/>Costello, Daniel J.<br\/>Collins, Oliver<br\/>University of Notre Dame<br\/><br\/>MRI: Acquisition of Instrumentation for an Experimental Radio Facility in Support of Wireless Digital Communications Research<br\/><br\/>A team of researchers proposes to construct a facility to provide two-way digital communications capabilities which will consists of two base stations, a number of mobile units and all test equipment necessary to effect narrowband transmission over a geographical area of several square miles.

This project restores balance between community and understandable processes, on the one hand, and serving larger populations with less effort, on the other. In doing so, it explores how the design of recommender systems affects their value to users. The project explores three types of questions by developing and studying new interfaces in the context of an existing recommender system. First, it examines interfaces that increase user control or understanding (e.g., explanations and user-controlled recommendations). Second it looks as interfaces that foster community (e.g., persistent identities and text reviews). Finally it assesses user behavior when provided with interfaces to select their own communities. This project results in a better understanding of how users interact in on-line communities built around information filtering needs.

Lam) and the University of Kentucky (PI: Kenneth Calvert).<br\/>Most Internet applications are based upon the client-server paradigm and make use of unicast<br\/>delivery of data sent as independent packets. The technical issues of securing unicast communi-<br\/>cations for client-server computing are fairly well understood. However, many emerging Internet<br\/>applications are based upon a group communications model. In particular, they require packet<br\/>delivery from one or more authorized senders to a large number of authorized receivers. Further-<br\/>more, the data of many of these applications should be viewed as flows rather than as independent<br\/>packets. Conceptually, since every point-to-multipoint communication can be represented as a set<br\/>of point-to-point communications, and every flow can be treated as a sequence of individual pack-<br\/>ets, the current technology base for securing unicast packets can be extended in a straightforward<br\/>manner to securing applications that employ flows and multicasts. Such extensions, however, would<br\/>be highly inefficient. They will not be applicable to high-speed transmission and delay-sensitive<br\/>ows, nor scalable to large groups.<br\/>The objectives of this proposal are to investigate architectures and protocols for securing mul-<br\/>ticast and flow applications with emphasis on efficiency, latency, and scalability. The researchers have obtained some preliminary results on scalable group key management and efficient digital signatures. These<br\/>are essential ingredients for designing and implementing secure multicast services. However, to de-<br\/>sign a scalable service for secure multicast on the Internet, even with just best-effort delivery, several<br\/>research issues remain, namely, performance comparison of alternative architectures, efficient and<br\/>reliable delivery of rekey messages (and their impact on a wide area network), and deployment of<br\/>trusted components and active agents.<br\/>The researchers next propose to investigate the more difficult problem of reliable secure multicast. For the<br\/>Internet, this problem has been largely unexplored. Initially, the researchers plan to approach this problem<br\/>from two directions, namely, (i) how to make reliable multicast secure, and (ii) how to make secure<br\/>multicast reliable. In addressing this problem, their concerns are, first, correctness, and second,<br\/>performance issues such as latency and scalability.<br\/>There are many applications that can benefit from techniques and services for securing flows<br\/>and multicasts, e.g., teleconference, pay per view, informaton services, virtual private networks,<br\/>collaborative work, software distribution, etc. The researchers propose to experiment with some of these applications. In particular, they propose to investigate a less obvious application, namely, active networks,<br\/>which raises some interesting research issues. Securing active networks is an important problem<br\/>with many different concerns, some of which are being addressed by other researchers. In the pro-<br\/>posed project, the researchers are primarily concerned with characterizing the authenticity and confidentiality requirements of mobile code distribution in active networks and ensuring their satisfaction using efficient methods.","title":"Secure Multicast Services and Applications","awardID":"9977267","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["516340"],"PO":["292741"]},"40128":{"abstract":"Reliable multicast is an important and challenging problem which is yet to be solved in order to deploy multicast services on the Internet. In this proposal, the researchers propose to design, implement, and evaluate a reliable multicast scheme for core-based multicast routing, with the objectives of avoiding NAK implosion and duplicate replies, reducing recovery latency, achieving recovery isolation, and providing adaptivity to dynamic topology\/membership changes.<br\/><br\/>Most exsiting reliable multicast schemes focus on source-based multicast trees. They either cannot be directly deployed in core-based multicast trees or may render sub-optimal performance when directly deployed. The major difficulty lies in that an on-tree router on a core-based tree does not know, due to lack of the per-source information, how to direct a retransmission request toward the source or some designated replier router. The researchers propose to design a simple, yet effective scheme that facilitates routers on a core-based tree to properly direct retransmission requests so as to closely emulate the optimal recovery scenario achieved in the turning point approach. Specifically, the researchers consider the following<br\/>research issues:<br\/><br\/>(1) To solve the problem of identifying upstream\/downstream interfaces (with respect to a source), The researchers will (i) define a new path_info IP Option that carries the path information and have some of the data packets in a connection carry this IP Option. Each receiver that receives a data packet with this IP Option stores the path information for future use; and (ii) define a new TP_info IP Option to be carried in the retransmission requests so that a router knows how to direct retransmission requests.<br\/><br\/>(2) To conduct local recovery in the case of membership and topology changes,the researchers will carefully devise a mechanism, with the use of on-line error statistics collection, soft state caching, and Bayesian analysis, for selecting designated hosts (called repliers) to which direct retransmission requests will be forwarded. A router now keeps track of error statistics over each of its interfaces and selects, with the use of<br\/>Bayesian analysis, the most reliable links as replier links.<br\/><br\/>(3) As indicated in [levine:98], a pure NAK-based scheme requires an infinite buffer at the source for correct operation. The researchers will devise a delayed ACK approach so that both sources and repliers can purge data packets that have been received by all the group members.<br\/><br\/>(4) For the proposed scheme to work in the existence of routers that do not have the reliable multicast capability, the researchers will devise a mechanism to detect clouds and to properly direct retransmission routers and reply messages through them, without loss of recovery isolation.<br\/><br\/>The proposed research is a combination of two synergistic components: development of all the component mechanisms in an analytic framework and their validation with software system building and experiments. We will pursue this research by taking advantage of the GateD Multicast source code (developed by the GateD Consortium, Merit Network, Inc.) as a software platform, and prototyping the proposed reliable multicast scheme (partially in the core-based multicast routing daemon and partially as the routing functions provided in the kernel). With the help of the Ohio Supercomputing Center (OSC) and OSU Medical Center, the researchers will use asdatabase\/server centered on large amounts of patient images acquired from MR and CT as a representative multicast application to illustrate the key functional, reliable, scalable, and adaptive characteristics of the prototype software.","title":"Reliable multicast for Core-Based Multicast Routing","awardID":"9903160","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["518511","342042"],"PO":["565090"]},"45947":{"abstract":"The researchers are developing an infrastructure that supports a) automatic generation of the functionality and architecture of a collaborative application, b) reuse of existing programs, and c) easy substitution of<br\/>infrastructure-provided components with custom ones.

The traditional graph partitioning problem focuses on computing a k-way partition of a graph such that the edge-cut is minimized and each partition has an equal number of vertices (or in the case of weighted graphs, the sum of the vertex-weights in each partition are the same). The task of minimizing the edge-cut can be considered as the objective and the requirement that the partitions will be of the same size can be considered as the constraint. Unfortunately, this single-constraint single-objective graph partitioning problem is not sufficient to model the underlying requirements of many current and emerging applications, especially in the area of high performance scientific simulations. In particular, the effective parallel solution of multi-physics and multi-phase computations in areas such as automobile engine design, crash-worthiness testing, fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, etc., requires that the partitioning algorithm simultaneously balances the computations performed during each one of the phases and minimizes the various communication overheads--none of which can be accomplished by the current graph models and partitioning algorithms. The key characteristic of these applications is that they require the partitioning algorithm to handle an arbitrary number of balancing constraints as well as an arbitrary number of optimization (either minimization or maximization) objectives.

A geographical area, called geocast region, is associated with a geocast, and a geocast message is delivered to all nodes present in the geocast region.

In mobile ad hoc networks, membership of a geocast group changes whenever hosts move in and out of the geocast region. Primary objective of this project is to develop flooding-based and tree-based approaches for geocasting in MANET and to evaluate their performance. Performance evaluation will be based on simulations as well as a prototype implementation. Because geocasts are directed towards a specified geocast region, use of directional antennas (instead of omnidirectional antennas) is expected to improve performance of geocasting in mobile ad hoc networks.

Such aberrations are rearrangements of chromosomes, caused by interactions of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). They are informative about radiation damage pathways as modulated by DNA repair and misrepair, and about chromatin structure at large scales, up to the full size of a mammalian chromosome. Their importance is in fact interdisciplinary, bridging the fields of radiobiology and cytogenetics, with information valuable for biodosimetry, risk estimation, chromosome structure, and the understanding of radiation-induced cell killing.<br\/><br\/>A very rich, colorful variety of chromosome aberrations can be observed using chromosome painting (fluorescent in situ hybridization -- i.e. FISH), which has revolutionized aberration work. Often current experimental results are so complex. involving dozens of different aberration categories, that mathematical analysis and computer calculations are essential for interpreting the data. The present project has two aims. The first aim is to analyze quantitatively the recombinational repair (\"one-hit\") molecular model of aberration formation. In contrast to older (breakage-and-rejoining or Revell) models, the recombinational repair model considers that radiation-produced DSBs lead to additional, enzymatically -produced breaks. If correct, the model has important implications for almost all areas of radiobiology.<br\/><br\/>Preliminary studies by the PI suggest that the model may be contradicted by current FISH data sets because the predicted frequency of visibly complex chromosome aberrations appears to exceed that observed. To be decisive the analysis needs more quantitative detail, obtainable only by Monte Carlo simulations. The project will develop the Monte Carlo algorithms, test the recombinational repair model with recent FISH data, and compare it to the breakage-and-rejoining model, which has hitherto been found generally consistent with experiments. In addition to a plethora of data for human cells, data on other genomes are now available and will be included to get a broad spectrum of comparative radisosensitivities, taking advantage of the fact that the aberration simulation software uses just two adjustable parameters (the number of reactive DSBs per unit dose per unit genomic size, and the number of DSB interaction sites), which can be compared meaningfully among different genomes.<br\/><br\/>The second project aim is to incorporate recent pulsed-field gel electrophoresis data on DSB clustering along chromatin, and related computations, into algorithms for estimating the formation probabilities of various intrachanges (i.e. 1-chromosome aberrations). Previous studies have indicated that radiation-produced intrachanges are unexpectedly frequent and are biologically important. Clustering of DSBs along chromatin has a strong influence on intrachanges, which can be estimated quantitatively by appropriate equations and simulations. Under this aim aberration data, and also published mutation data dealing mainly with radiation-produced large deletions, will be compared to estimates obtained from the intrachange algorithms developed.<br\/><br\/>The proposed data analysis tools are comparatively inexpensive. They can supply much-needed coherence to aberration data, interrelate different empirical assays, and will help guide new experiments or critical rexaminations of extant data sets in laboratories world-wide.","title":"Chromosome Aberration Frequencies and Chromatin Geometry: Algorithms and Experiments","awardID":"9904842","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0703","name":"Division of CIVIL, MECHANICAL, & MANUFACT","abbr":"CMMI"},"pgm":{"id":"1266","name":"APPLIED MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0808","name":"Division of BIOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"DBI"},"pgm":{"id":"1107","name":"COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY ACTIVITI"}}],"PIcoPI":[102904],"PO":["561879"]},"42836":{"abstract":"9911033<br\/>Hart, John<br\/>Association for Computing Machinery<br\/><br\/>Special Project: The Story of Computer Graphics' Documentary Project<br\/><br\/><br\/>ACM\/SIGGRAPH will produce a video documenting the history of computer graphics.

The technical issues of securing unicast communications for client-server computing is fairly well understood. However, many emerging Internet applications are based upon a group communications model. In particular, they require packet delivery from one or more authorized senders to a large number of authorized receivers. Furthermore, the data of many of these applications should be viewed as flows rather than as independent packets. Conceptually, since every point-to-multipoint communication can be represented as a set of point-to-point communications, and every flow can be treated as a sequence of individual packets, the current technology base for securing unicast packets can be extended in a straightforward manner to securing applications that employ flows and multicasts. Such extensions, however, would be highly inefficient. They will not be applicable to high-speed transmission and delay-sensitive flows, nor scalable to large groups.<br\/><br\/>The objectives of this proposal are to investigate architectures and protocols for securing multicast and flow applications with emphasis on efficiency, latency, and scalability. The researchers have obtained some preliminary results on scalable group key management and efficient digital signatures. These are essential ingredients for designing and implementing secure multicast services. However, to design a scalable service for secure multicast on the Internet, even with just best-effort delivery, several research issues remain, namely, performance comparison of alternative architectures, efficient and reliable delivery of rekey messages (and their impact on a wide area network), and deployment of trusted components and active agents.<br\/><br\/>The researchers next propose to investigate the more difficult problem of reliable secure multicast.

In addressing this problem, our concerns are, first, correctness, and second, performance issues such as latency and scalability.<br\/><br\/>There are many applications that can benefit from techniques and services for securing flows and multicasts, e.g., teleconference, pay per view, information services, virtual private networks, collaborative work, software distribution, etc. The researchers propose to experiment with some of these applications. In particular, they propose to investigate a less obvious application, namely, active networks, which raises some interesting research issues. Securing active networks is an important problem with many different concerns, some of which are being addressed by other researchers. In the proposed project, the researchers are primarily concerned with characterizing the authenticity and confidentiality requirements of mobile code distribution in active networks and ensuring their satisfaction using efficient methods.","title":"Secure Multicast Services and Applications","awardID":"9977292","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2005-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["483390"],"PO":["7594"]},"47908":{"abstract":"PI's Name: Devanbu, Premkumar T. <br\/>Institution: University of California, Davis.<br\/>TITLE: A Framework for Debugging Domain-Specific Languages<br\/><br\/>Domain specific languages (DSL), high-level programming languages with constructs expressing precisely the concepts of a specific application domain, can be used to implement entire applications as DSL scripts.

A few possible applications include video conferencing, tele-medicine, and interactive access to pre-recorded videos stored in remote databases. There are two main requirements for internet video communication: (1) bandwidth scalability; (2) error-resilient. Lack of bandwidth scalability results in non-adaptive streams with two sets of disadvantages. First, it leads to congestion collapse when the aggregate bandwidth<br\/>of the video traffic exceeds network capacity. Second, it competes unfairly with other adaptive traffic, such as TCP, which reduces transmission rate in face of network congestion. Lack of error resilience results in error propagation, and hence widely varying video quality as a function of time. Current approaches to mitigate the effects of error propagation include error control mechanisms at the transport level. This typically takes the form of retransmissions or forward error correction (FEC). Retransmission based error control methods often fail to be real-time, particularly when round-trip propagation delay is large.<br\/>FEC schemes on the other hand, are often ineffective when losses are bursty.<br\/><br\/>The main goal of this proposal is to investigate video compression techniques and transport protocols needed for real time delivery of unicast and multicast video over best effort networks such as the internet. Our approach for the unicast case is to combine a novel compression method that is error resilient and bandwidth scalable with a low-delay TCP-friendly transport protocol. Specifically, compressed video is packetized into individually decodable packets of equal expected visual importance. Consequently, relatively constant video quality can be achieved at the receiver under lossy conditions. Furthermore, the packets can be truncated to instantaneously meet the time varying bandwidth imposed by a TCP-friendly transport protocol. As a result,<br\/>adaptive flows that are friendly to other Internet traffic are produced. Actual Internet experiments together with simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the compression, transport, and the combined schemes.<br\/><br\/>Our approach to multicast video transmission is to combine bandwidth scalable video compression scheme with hierarchical FEC. By hierarchical FEC, we mean the production of embedded FEC or redundancy<br\/>streams, each of which belongs to a different multicast group. This way, subscribing to more groups corresponds to higher level of protection, but larger delays. There are two advantages to this approach. First, each receiver can independently adjust the desired level of protection based on past reception statistics and loss characteristics. This receiver-driven approach to FEC is more flexible than most existing FEC schemes for multicast where the source determines a set of redundancy packets which are then multicast to every recipient. Second, each receiver will subscribe to only as many redundancy layers as necessary, reducing overall bandwidth utilization. Furthermore, the hierarchical nature of the FEC layers ensures<br\/>minimum network utilization through sharing of common redundancy streams. Actual internet experiments will be done to examine the effectiveness of our approach.","title":"Video Compression Algorithms and Related Transport Protocols for Real Time, Unicast and Multicast Video over internet","awardID":"9905799","effectiveDate":"1999-09-15","expirationDate":"2003-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["118490"],"PO":["565090"]},"41738":{"abstract":"This research addresses a number of challenges related to the full realization of the potential of supply chain infrastructures(SCIs), which include those software systems used to support enterprise requirements planning (ERP) and supply chain management (SCM).

Four strands of previous research support this effort: specification of a<br\/>formal model of collaboration, construction of prototype collaboration-capable systems, specification of models of negotiation, and development of a simulation framework for empirically investigating decision-making in the context of group activities.<br\/><br\/>The project contributes to fundamental research in collaboration, to the development of collaboration-capable software agents and collaborative human-computer interface systems, and to the training of undergraduate and graduate students.","title":"Decision-Making in the Context of Commitments to Team Activity","awardID":"9907482","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2003-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6850","name":"DIGITAL SOCIETY&TECHNOLOGIES"}}],"PIcoPI":["333993"],"PO":["565227"]},"45907":{"abstract":"EIA-9977218<br\/>Hansen, Charles<br\/>Cohen, Elaine<br\/>University of Utah<br\/><br\/>MRI: Acquisition of an Experimental Testbed for Computer Graphics<br\/><br\/>The proposal requests a large-scale, multi-processor compute engine with which they plan to investigate alternative rendering strategies with potential suitability for desktop systems in a decade or so. Because of the many trade-offs between image quality, rendering speed, and interactivity that must be considered, this work is highly experimental in nature and requires dedicated computing power sufficient for software implementation of possible approaches able to run interactively. The value of improved interactive rendering will be demonstrated in a broad range of application areas, including architectural walkthroughs, terrain rendering, computer-aided geometric design, medical imaging, and scientific visualization.","title":"MRI: Acquisition of an Experimental Testbed for Computer Graphics","awardID":"9977218","effectiveDate":"1999-09-01","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"1189","name":"MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["486565","560997","292838","496204","558600"],"PO":["557609"]}}
