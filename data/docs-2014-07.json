{"210031":{"abstract":"Given samples from some unknown distribution, what can one infer about the underlying distribution, and how efficiently can these inferences be made? \u00a0In many of the most fundamental settings, our understanding of the computational and information theoretic possibilities and barriers is still startlingly poor. \u00a0This project tackles two broad research objectives: developing efficient algorithms for probing data, and understanding how to efficiently estimate properties of distributions. \u00a0The first line of research seeks to understand which questions about a dataset can be answered extremely efficiently, requiring computational resources (time, or memory) that are sublinear in the size of the dataset or distribution. \u00a0The second research objective is to understand the minimal amount of information necessary to ascertain, with high probability, whether or not a distribution or dataset possesses a given property. \u00a0In the context of statistical property estimation, this problem asks how few samples are needed to estimate the property in question to a desired accuracy, with high probability. \u00a0This research pursues both new estimation algorithms, and new information theoretic tools and lower bounds.<br\/><br\/>With vast and important datasets emerging across many disciplines, from genetic, biological, and medical databases, to databases documenting our economic and social behaviors, the challenge of how to make sense of them has particular immediate relevance and has rapidly become the bottleneck in scientific understanding. \u00a0 The specific problems investigated in this project arise in the analysis of these datasets; algorithmic advances on these problems have the potential to very quickly be adopted and transform ongoing data analysis efforts. \u00a0 Beyond the immediate implications for the data sciences, these questions are extremely basic and foundational. As such, new techniques, perspectives, and insights gleaned from their study are likely to have broad implications for other problems throughout computer science, statistics, information theory, and the data sciences.","title":"CAREER: Algorithms for understanding data","awardID":"1351108","effectiveDate":"2014-07-01","expirationDate":"2019-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7796","name":"ALGORITHMIC FOUNDATIONS"}}],"PIcoPI":[562979],"PO":["565251"]},"210020":{"abstract":"The rapid increase in sensor data is revolutionizing many areas of technology, defense, and scientific discovery. Fortunately, despite data being high-dimensional, various aspects of the data can frequently be characterized as having low-dimensional geometric structure. This research project dramatically improves machine intelligence by exploiting this geometric structure for more effective, efficient and interactive data analysis systems. Complementary to these technical objectives, this project also aims to engage, recruit, and educate a diverse collection of students to STEM careers by developing novel curricular and outreach materials that illustrate how mathematics can be used in information systems. The potential benefits of this project are wide ranging in areas where data plays a fundamental role.<br\/><br\/>Improving machine intelligence requires understanding how to best exploit the underlying low-dimensional structure in data for a given type of task, and this project is guided by three research objectives toward this goal. The first objective enhances machine effectiveness by exploiting the fact that multiple observations of the same phenomenon are often related by movement along a manifold, with a particular focus on the canonical computer vision problem of invariant object recognition. The second objective seeks to improve computational efficiency by developing dimensionality reduction techniques for manifold-modeled data that preserves information about nonlinear feature-space mappings. The third objective seeks to leverage interactivity to fully \"close the loop\" between between humans and machines while learning low-dimensional information from a human expert (an extension of the active learning paradigm). The project also pursues two educational objectives, including developing curriculum modules for pre-college outreach and integrating neural systems content into the ECE curriculum to illustrate the connections between quantitative methods and intelligent systems.","title":"CAREER: Exploiting low-dimensional structure in data for more effective, efficient and interactive machine intelligence","awardID":"1350954","effectiveDate":"2014-07-01","expirationDate":"2019-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7797","name":"COMM & INFORMATION FOUNDATIONS"}}],"PIcoPI":[562955],"PO":["564898"]},"210010":{"abstract":"This research is aimed at helping software developers understand, diagnose, and fix bugs in software. A large class of bugs that are caused by logical inconsistencies in the software code, i.e., incongruences between the developers' expectation of how the program should behave and the way it actually does. Such common logical inconsistencies typically require developer attention and comprehension, and are not amenable to algorithmic location and repair. As such, the goal of this research is to assist software developers performing software maintenance and debugging tasks by facilitating their comprehension of the software and its behavior, with the ultimate goal of equipping them to produce higher quality software, more economically.<br\/><br\/>Viewing the challenges of software maintenance and debugging as challenges of human comprehension, the research aims to help understand where bugs reside in the codebase, why the code behaves incorrectly, who are the developers best equipped to understand and fix problems, and when were the changes made that introduced bugs. These questions are addressed using a combination of (1) automated recommendation systems to use software artifacts and analyses to provide automated assistance to engineers; (2) discovery and exploration tools to enable engineers to develop deeper comprehension of the automated recommendations; novel experimental protocols and evaluations to determine sources of comprehension challenges. The research combines ideas from software analysis and human-computer interaction. Better understanding of software faults and how to repair them will lead to higher quality software at reduced costs.","title":"CAREER: Aiding Comprehension of Complex Software Dynamics to Support High-Quality Software Development","awardID":"1350837","effectiveDate":"2014-07-01","expirationDate":"2019-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}}],"PIcoPI":[562935],"PO":["564388"]},"209964":{"abstract":"Increasingly, the data visualizations used in contemporary science and media move beyond conventional graphs or diagrams to use problem-specific imagery and computational techniques to reveal patterns of interest. K-12 students, however, do not have many opportunities to explore such data visualizations, or to author their own. The goal of this project is to design software tools and classroom materials that make exploring and authoring data visualizations accessible in middle grades classrooms. The underlying hypothesis of the project is that by exploring and constructing their own data visualizations, students can develop data literacy, learn core math and science content, and engage in key STEM practices in powerful new ways. <br\/><br\/>The project involves two interrelated strands: (1) research on grade 6-8 students' knowledge related to data visualization, and (2) the development and study of DataSketch, a tablet-based tool for students to create sketches and program them to respond to archival or live data input. Research will include interviews, studio workshops, and classroom-based studies to explore: (1) what knowledge and skills middle school students have, and need to develop, to interpret and construct data visualizations? (2) how data visualization can be integrated into the grade 6-8 STEM curriculum? and, (3) what role data visualization can contribute to middle students' learning of core STEM practices and content? <br\/><br\/>Partners include two schools with historically under served student populations in the Greater Boston metro area, and teachers across the greater New England region. There are opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students studying Computer Science and Education at Tufts University to conduct research and outreach at participating middle school sites.
