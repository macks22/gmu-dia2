A study by an expert committee organized under the auspices of the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of National Research Council is exploring these emerging challenges to sustaining computing performance growth through a consideration of issues from hardware to system architecture to operating systems to software programming models and languages to applications. Through briefings by experts, presentations and discussions at workshops, and deliberations of the expert study committee, the study is examining these challenges and their implications for the U.S. computing industry. Building on an assessment of emerging solutions, open research problems, and promising directions, a research, development, and educational agenda will be developed along with recommendations aimed at implementing the agenda.

Whatever the program counter points to the instruction is fetched and executed. Whenever this blindfolded instruction sequencing is not properly addressed at a higher level by system and application software, it becomes a vulnerability that malicious software exploits. To mend this fundamental flaw, this project explores incorporating control flow validation into modern high-performance pipelined processors. A straightforward idea of control flow validation can be collecting possible target addresses per branch to check every branching instance. Modern microprocessors do this checking in some sense already at micro-architecture level in the form of branch prediction. Since illegitimate control transfer in program execution can be made only when the processor's program counter is \"forced\" to point to \"unseen\" addresses, control flow altering attacks cause branch mis-predictions in the processor micro-architecture; branch mis-prediction is one of the symptoms of misbehavior in program execution such as binary code tampering and virus infection. This project develops micro-architecture for incorporating control flow validation into the branch prediction unit of modern high-performance pipelined processors. A processor core with secure control flow creates a basis for designing and building more trusted devices and cyber infrastructure. This project will produce a practical hardware support for validating program control flow to provide protection from not-yet-known attacks and exploits, i.e. before the behavior patterns, attack signatures, or vulnerabilities they exploit are analyzed and captured.","title":"CT-ER: Augmenting Branch Prediction for Trusted Computing","awardID":"0627341","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7371","name":"CYBER TRUST"}}],"PIcoPI":[316670],"PO":["529429"]},"119306":{"abstract":"This proposal describes a set of tasks that fit within the larger context of the NSF FIND program, part of the current NeTS solicitation from CISE. The FIND program considers the question of what a future global network of 10 or 15 years should be, and what research is required to build it. A number of factors will differentiate the research funded in this networking focus area from more traditional NSF-supported research, including the need to bring a number of separately funded research teams together over the course of their projects, with an early goal of team building, and a final goal of convergence toward a small number of coherent proposals for network architecture. These special goals signal that some tasks will have to be undertaken that would not normally be proposed or funded in the context of the traditional solicitation process. This proposal is intended to assist NSF in achieving its overall goals for this project by addressing some of these special needs. In cooperation with NSF, I propose to take on the role of Architecture and Outreach Coordinator for the FIND project.<br\/><br\/>The tasks proposed here offers NSF an opportunity to deal with the following issues: architecture framing and groundwork, working meetings and other tools for community building, outreach, ongoing program planning, identification of research priorities (and possible missing areas of investigation), integration of non-NSF funded parties into the coordination process, and linkage to the GENI program, a proposed MREFC project to support research such as FIND.

This work can lead to a more coherent articulation of long-range requirements for a future network, and a growing understanding in the community of the relationship between requirements and mechanism. This work can lead to a substantive shift in focus of specific sub-fields, such as security. It can lead to new understanding of Internet design alternatives. These outcomes will not be in consequence of this proposal alone, but this proposed work will increase the focus and coherence of the overall effort and assist the FIND program in meeting its long-term goals.<br\/><br\/>Broader impact: The broader impact of this work will be measured by the success of the<br\/>FIND project, both in the research community and, in the longer run, in the world at large. The goal of FIND is to offer to the world a better Internet: more secure, more predictable, and more relevant to tomorrow's needs. This initiative, if successful, will have a highly visible impact of major proportions. The goal of this proposal, in particular, is to nurture the process of turning research contributions from individuals and small teams into a larger, organized assault on the high-level goal. If the NSF is successful at this vision, the payoff of a better, more secure Internet, better aligned with the needs of society, is a powerful contribution by NSF and the research community.","title":"NeTS-NBD: Future Internet Design (FIND) Architecture and Outreach Coordination","awardID":"0626840","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["565000"],"PO":["565090"]},"119317":{"abstract":"This project aims at developing a formal methodology for analyzing channel-aware random access in wireless networks.

As their economic importance grows along with their size and complexity, it becomes critical to ensure their operational health and robustness through continuous monitoring. With that motivation, this project develops lightweight monitoring algorithms and tools for sensor networks that allow the network operators to observe the large-scale behavior of the network and detect significant anomalies in network attributes or performance. The tools themselves are generic and can be composed to provide tailored solutions to meet various application-specific needs.<br\/><br\/>The design of these monitoring tools requires inferring global aspects of the network through local information available at individual nodes. In order to synthesize a global summary from local views in a lightweight, energy-efficient manner, the project employs three methods: (1) intelligent sampling, (2) information aggregation, and (3) sparse representation of the signal landscape. These methods utilize mathematical techniques from geometry, topology, statistics, and distributed signal processing.<br\/><br\/>The network monitoring tools enable better designed, more robust, trustworthy, and longer-lived sensor networks in operation. That, in turn lowers costs and enlarges the community of users as well as the set of potential commercial applications for networked sensing.<br\/><br\/>The research output of this project includes novel algorithms, software tools, and their empirical evaluation using testbeds.","title":"NeTS-NOSS: Collaborative Research: Lightweight Monitoring Tools for Sensor Networks","awardID":"0626954","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["536698"],"PO":["564777"]},"119449":{"abstract":"David Walker<br\/>Princeton University<br\/>0627650<br\/>Panel: 060970<br\/>Well-typed trustworthy computing in the presence of transient faults<br\/><br\/>Abstract<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>In recent decades, microprocessor performance has been increasing<br\/>exponentially, due in large part to smaller and faster transistors<br\/>enabled by improved fabrication technology.

This situation has spurred much interest in efficient runtime monitoring of software systems' dynamic behavior in production environments. Most existing runtime monitoring approaches, however, suffer from three limitations: they are ad-hoc and hard to extend\/adapt; they impose too much overhead to be practical; and they are defined within only one computational layer (hardware, O\/S, VM, or software). This project will investigate and define a general, efficient runtime monitoring approach that leverages software and hardware capabilities in a synergistic way. In this approach, monitoring tasks will be specified using a language that provides suitable abstractions. These specifications will then be automatically analyzed and the monitoring tasks distributed across software and hardware layers to minimize performance overhead. This project will improve the state of the art by (1) providing hardware and software support for new monitoring activities currently neglected as impractical, (2) developing infrastructure and tools that will be made available to the research community, and (3) improving overall software quality through detection of and reaction to anomalous, erratic, or malicious software behavior.","title":"Collaborative Research: Software and Hardware Support for Efficient Monitoring of Program Behavior","awardID":"0541075","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":["557313"],"PO":["564388"]},"122892":{"abstract":"Hamilton College seeks funding for fifty faculty from minority\/female undergraduate institutions to attend the Federated Conference on Research in Computing (FCRC) in 2007.

While a compiler optimization and\/or an architectural feature may be developed to improve one aspect of an embedded application, it often comes at the detriment of another. An instruction register file (IRF) can help to achieve these goals. Frequently used instructions are placed in the IRF, and multiple IRF instructions can be referenced by a single packed instruction in ROM or a level-one (L1) instruction cache. This approach enables multiple instructions to be referenced in a single instruction fetched from the memory system and results<br\/>in multiple instances of the same instruction in the executable being replaced with a smaller IRF index. This research investigates a variety of techniques to enhance the effectiveness of utilizing an IRF. By increasing the number of instructions referenced from the IRF, it is possible to further reduce energy consumption and decrease code size. The project is implementing a number of compilation and architectural techniques to address previous limitations on the number of instructions being packed in an application. The research also explores how an IRF can complement other compiler optimizations and\/or architectural features that save energy and reduce code size.

Within the software engineering domain, the goal is to reduce development times and produce higher quality code in enterprise software that is continually evolving due to changing business needs and management initiatives. This project builds upon and compliments tools and technologies developed over the past decade such as: Services Oriented Architecture (SOA), Model Driven Architecture (MDA), and associated standards (primarily from the Extensible Markup Language (XML), web services, Unified Modeling Language (UML), and Object Management Group (OMG) communities). The SOA and MDA paradigms focus primarily on procedural representations of business processes and BPI environments. The premise of this research is that value can be added to BPI by developing a targeted declarative framework for specifying the properties of business processes and associated artifacts, including their possible behaviors and possible impacts on their environment. Two improvements that this declarative approach may produce are: (1) precision, because in many cases the procedural specifications, especially when at a higher level of abstraction, are ambiguous in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, and (2) flexibility, because it will afford many more kinds of incomplete specification than available from the procedural approaches. The foundation of the declarative framework for BPI is provided by the Process Specification Language (PSL), a first-order logic based ISO standard developed for specifying, analyzing, and integrating processes, initially introduced manufacturing. The domain of knowledge that supports this project is, to a large extent, the result of prior research by project team members including the design and development of PSL. All four research collaborators played a central role in the development of the Firstorder Logic Ontology for Web Services (FLOWS), which forms part of the Semantic Web Services Framework (SWSF). FLOWS is a formal extension of PSL, which explicitly incorporates and axiomatizes in a declarative framework the key building blocks of semantic web services. FLOWS (and PSL beneath it) provide a starting point for the development of a declarative framework for supporting BPI design. By targeting on the design and management of business processes with the service-oriented paradigm, this project may improve the efficiency and productivity of business process management and integration and lay a foundation for SOA research as a step towards service science. <br\/><br\/>Program Manager: Anita J.

One expects several benefits from such an approach. First and foremost, quantum computing can yield an exponential speedup over classical computation for certain problems, such as predicted by Feynman for simulating quantum systems and by Shor for factoring integers. Moreover, quantum key distribution also brings complete security against eavesdropping to cryptography.<br\/><br\/>Daunting challenges face attempts at experimentally realizing a quantum computer. On the one hand, one needs scalability, i.e. a large number of quantum logic units (\"qubits\" if binary ones or \"qudits\" if multi-state ones), all individually addressable and able to interact pairwise to become entangled. On the other hand, one needs this interaction to be strictly controlled and limited to the qubits or qudits, in order to avoid decoherence, which is the measurement-like, irreversible random evolution that results from interaction of a quantum register with the environment, a reservoir of quantum systems. Spontaneous emission is an example of decoherence for atoms.<br\/><br\/>This project is dedicated to all-optical implementation of quantum information. Light has remarkable resistance to decoherence, due to its extremely weak (photon-photon) interaction. This, is turn, may present a difficulty for generating quantum entanglement (aforementioned pairwise interactions) but this problem is solved by the use of the mature and ever more sophisticated techniques of nonlinear optics and, in our case, of the laser-like, highly spatially and temporally coherent optical beams emitted by the optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The potential of OPO's for quantum information and, in particular, quantum communication, is very well known but is still far from having been fully exploited. The experimental approach of the proposal is centered on marrying the principles and techniques of ultra-high resolution laser spectroscopy and time-frequency metrology to those of nonlinear and quantum optics. This proposal aims at extending classical signal processing techniques into the quantum domain, in particular by using the frequency domain to encode the qudits and realize \"quantum multiplexing,\" a quantum optical version of FM versus AM radio signals. This will be realized with state-of-the-art phase- and frequency-stabilized OPO's and will subsequently enable the transfer of quantum information, by teleportation or direct entanglement, between different types of physical qudits, such as alkali atoms (quantum memory) or photons in optical fibers (quantum bus). Applications of qudit-based dense coding to ultrasensitive optical measurements impossible with qubits are also discussed.<br\/><br\/>Broader impacts of the proposed work comprise an active contribution to the UVa Physics graduate program, with the direct research advising of five students, of several Departmental seminars per year, and of a new advanced course \"Quantum Optics and Quantum Information\" (Phys 888), which was created in the spring of 2005 by the P.I. In addition, undergraduate students are periodically joining in the research effort at various levels, including graduate research. Also included are collaborative efforts with UVa Engineering faculty to foster cross-Departmental research. Finally, broader dissemination of research results includes the organization of interdisciplinary conferences at UVa, in association with the Department of Mathematics.

Finding flaws in the security protocols for sensor networks is even harder because they operate under fundamentally different system design assumptions such as event-driven vs. imperative or message passing, resource and bandwidth constraints, hostile deployment scenarios, trivial physical capturing due to the lack of temper resistance, group-oriented behavior, ad hoc and dynamic topologies, open-ended nature, etc. These assumptions lead to complex security protocols, which in turn makes them much harder to verify. Sensor networks are increasingly becoming an integral part of the nation's cyber infrastructure, making it vital to protect them against cryptographic errors in security protocols. There are several existing techniques for specifying and verifying cryptographic protocols; however, none accommodates all the system design assumptions mentioned above.

Knowing the answer to this question would allow the design of radically new technologies with adaptive capabilities that would far outstrip the capabilities of technologies existing today. Recent behavioral and neurobiological experiments have suggested that the brain may rely on probabilistic principles for perception, action, and learning. <br\/>The goal of the proposed research project is to develop a rigorous probabilistic framework for neural computation and to test the resulting models in two ways: (1) in collaborative biological experiments, and (2) in applications involving robotics and brain-machine interfaces. Our specific research goals include:<br\/>1. Probabilistic Models of Neural Computation: We will develop new models of neural computation based on treating the problems of sensory information processing and action selection as probabilistic inference problems. We will investigate how biological models such as networks of integrate-and-fire neurons can represent probability distributions and how the propagation of neural activities in such networks can implement algorithms for probabilistic (Bayesian) inference of unknown quantities. We will also explore the connections between well-known neurobiological rules governing synaptic plasticity and statistically-derived learning rules.<br\/>2. Experimental Validation using Electrocorticographic Studies: Our models of Bayesian inference will be tested by co-PI Ojemann's group in experiments involving electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals recorded from the human brain in consenting patients being monitored in the days prior to brain surgery. Experiments will focus on testing the predictions of our models in tasks involving visual discrimination, recognition, and sensorimotor integration. Results from the experiments will be used to refine existing models and develop new probabilistic models inspired by neurobiological data.<br\/>3. Applications in Probabilistic Robotics and Brain-Machine Interfaces: We will test the robustness of our probabilistic models by implementing the corresponding algorithms on an existing humanoid robot in PI Rao's laboratory. We will be focusing primarily on sensorimotor integration and inference of actions for stable control of movements. Simultaneously, we will explore the applicability of our probabilistic models to brain-machine interfaces. The specific goals are to control a cursor on a computer screen and control a 4-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm by probabilistically inferring real and imagined movements from ECoG signals in real time.<br\/>The educational component of the project involves interdisciplinary training for one graduate student, research experiences for undergraduates, and curriculum development in the form of a new graduate level course on brain-machine interfaces.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed research represents one of the first interdisciplinary efforts to develop and test a rigorous probabilistic framework for understanding neuronal computation in the brain. Also novel is the application of neurally-inspired probabilistic models to robotics and brain-machine interfaces, two areas that could benefit tremendously from the robustness and adaptability afforded by such models.<br\/>Broader Impact: If successful, this research will lead to a new understanding of computation in the brain, offering unique insights into the mechanisms underlying human behavior and cognition. The application to brain-machine interfaces could dramatically improve the quality of life of paralyzed and disabled patients.

At the same time, perimeter firewalls and NAT devices designed to protect networks are becoming porous to many of the threats they were designed to defend against. The end result has been a proliferation of undetected malicious activity inside network perimeters. To combat the rise of threats inside the network and the lack of visibility into sub-networks, this research seeks to construct a set of techniques for building a topologically-accurate map of unused and unreachable addresses (darknets) inside a network, and then using that map to deploy a pervasive detection system. The key insight that enables the approach is integration with routing, policy, and host management systems that already understand part of the address topology. This topology information will be used to construct a high-level map of address usage and then place darknet sensors at thousands of different locations inside the network to detect threats inside the network perimeter and threats outside trying to penetrate in. Using multi-dimensional data mining techniques we will then develop a framework for analyzing the huge volume of data produced by the detectors.

For example, cells of the immune system respond to pathogenic invasions by crawling which involves cycles of extensions and contractions that deform their entire cell surface followed by phagocytosis, in which cells deform themselves around the captured invaders. Similarly, during cytokinesis, the last stage of cell division, cells rearrange themselves completely so as to produce two identical daughter cells. These cell shape changes are induced by the spatial and temporal regulation of a large number of cytoskeletal proteins. This regulation leads to spatial heterogeneity in the mechanical properties of the cell. A thorough understanding of how these processes are regulated requires both knowledge of the biochemical and genetic regulation of the cytoskeletal proteins, as well as an appreciation of the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton. The complexity of the underlying system requires that conceptual models be tested by means of computational modeling coupled to quantitative measurements. However, because of the difficulty of modeling free boundaries inherent in cellular shape changes, traditional computational methods are not well suited.<br\/>In this research we propose to provide a suitable framework, based on the level set formalism, for studying the interplay between the biochemical regulation of cytoskeletal proteins and the corresponding cellular deformations. Specifically:<br\/><br\/>1. Using the level set framework for describing moving and deformable boundaries, we will develop physical models of the mechanical properties of cells.

By focusing on one of the principle processes of life, how cells deform in response to their mechanical environment, the proposed research will be of great scientific interest. <br\/>More importantly, we expect our proposed research to have broader impact than the specific research proposed here. Our modeling framework will provide needed computational infrastructure that should prove useful for describing other biological responses, such as cell migration, in which differential localization of several proteins lead to cellular deformations.

Fundamental to this architecture is a transport layer service that operates in a hop-by-hop store-and-forward manner with large files. To realize this architecture, this project designs, implements and evaluates a new network architecture that incorporates the following elements: (1) reliable hop-by-hop transport of large files; (2) push-pull architecture for opportunistic delivery of files both to and from the wired network; (3) enhanced naming to provide location information for mobile terminals; and (4) distributed caching of popular content to make peer-to-peer file sharing a first-class service and to enable efficient reliable multicast. <br\/><br\/>The experimental evaluation phase of the project, based on extensive use of PlanetLab, the ORBIT radio grid testbed and real world environments supported by future experimental systems, examines network performance trade-offs for various potential protocol design choices and usage\/traffic scenarios. The technical merit of this project is in the complementary mix of architectural design, the development of macroscopic models quantifying the performance benefits of architectural components, and a prototype implementation and experimental validation of key architectural innovations. The broader impact of this project is its contribution towards the definition and selection of one or more protocol architectures for the future Internet, leading to new services and applications of value to both scientific and commercial end users.","title":"Collaborative Research: NeTS-FIND: Postcards from the Edge: A Cache-and-Forward Architecture for the Future Internet","awardID":"0626959","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7631","name":"ITR-NeTS"}}],"PIcoPI":[316426,"564746","463100"],"PO":["565090"]},"122860":{"abstract":"In recent years, there have been many studies focusing on improving the accuracy of prediction of transmembrane segments, and many significant results have been achieved. In spite of these considerable results, the existing methods lack the ability to explain the process of how a learning result is reached and why a prediction decision is made. The explanation of a decision made is important for the acceptance of machine learning technology in bioinformatics applications such as protein structure prediction. While support vector machines (SVM) have shown strong generalization ability in a number of application areas, including protein structure prediction, they are black box models and hard to understand. In our current NSF project (CCR 0514750), rough sets data analysis has been proposed for data mining. In this project, we propose to extend our results in data mining from the current NSF project to bioinformatics. In particular, we propose to use an innovative approach to rule generation for understanding prediction of transmembrane<br\/>segments by integrating the merits of rough set theory, SVMs and association rule based classifiers. We believe that the new approach can be used not only for transmembrane segments prediction, but also for understanding the prediction. The prediction and its interpretation obtained can be used for guiding biological experiments.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merits: The focus of this proposal is to combine rough set theory from our current NSF project, SVMs and association rule based classifiers to elucidate a new approach for transmembrane segments prediction and its understanding. While there exist several methods for the same purpose, the proposal seeks to achieve better performance with respect to accuracy and the number of generated patterns. It is hoped that the patterns generated can be easily understandable and biologically meaningful and can be used by biologists to guide their experiments. This collaborative approach draws upon the strengths of the PI in machine learning and the co-PI's expertise in transmembrane to validate our new method. The resulting software<br\/>will not only be able to predict transmembrane segments, but moreover how the prediction is achieved.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: While the focus of the this proposal is on transmembrane segments prediction and its understanding, it must be emphasized that the new approach and the software tools developed are completely generalizable and can be applied to other domains such as protein secondary structure prediction. The collaborators believe the process described in this proposal is as important as the end product as the proposal is inherently collaborative and cross-disciplinary. As such, the proposal lends itself immediately as a jumping point for increasing the interaction between computer scientists and biologists, important not only as part of modern research approaches to tackling difficult problems in cell biology and complex systems but in exposing students and researchers to both the cutting edge research and problems that are manifest in each<br\/>of our respective fields.","title":"Transmembrane Protein Segment Prediction and Understanding based on Machine Learning Methods","awardID":"0646102","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2008-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1705","name":"BIOLOGY & INFORMATION TECHNOLO"}}],"PIcoPI":[326093,"37090","559419"],"PO":["521045"]},"119109":{"abstract":"This proposal develops and studies sparse variants of classic multivariate data analysis methods. It primarily focuses on sparse principal component analysis (PCA) and the related sparse canonical correlation analysis (CCA), but also intends to explore sparse variants of methods such as correspondence analysis and discriminant analysis. The motivation for developing sparse multivariate analysis algorithms is their potential for yielding statistical results that are more interpretable and more robust than classical analyses, while giving up as little as possible in the way of statistical efficiency and expressive power. The investigators have derived a convex relaxation for sparse PCA as a large-scale semidefinite program. The proposed research first studies the theoretical and practical performance of this relaxation as well as the computational complexity involved in solving large-scale instances of the corresponding semidefinite programs. In a next step, it focuses on extending these results to the other multivariate data analysis methods cited above. <br\/><br\/>Principal Component Analysis (or PCA) is a classic statistical tool used to study experimental data with a very large number of variables (meteorological records, gene expression coefficients, the interest rate curve, social networks, etc). It is primarily used as a dimensionality reduction tool: PCA produces a reduced set of synthetic variables that captures a maximum amount of information on the data. This makes it possible to represent data sets with thousands of variables on a three dimensional graph while still capturing most of the features of the original data, thus making visualization and interpretation easier. Unfortunately, the key shortcoming of PCA is that these new synthetic variables are a weighted sum of all the original variables making their physical interpretation difficult. The proposed research will study algorithms for computing sparse PCA, i.e., computing new synthetic variables that are the weighted sum of only a few problem variables while keeping most of the features of the original data set. Sparse PCA is a hard combinatorial problem but the investigators have produced a relaxation that can be solved efficiently using recent results in convex optimization. The investigators plan to study the theoretical and practical performance of this relaxation and extend these results to other statistical methods.","title":"Collaborative Research: MSPA-MCS: Sparse Multivariate Data Analysis","awardID":"0625371","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0304","name":"Division of MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES","abbr":"DMS"},"pgm":{"id":"7454","name":"MSPA-INTERDISCIPLINARY"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2878","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CCF"}}],"PIcoPI":["497161","533211"],"PO":["565309"]},"122871":{"abstract":"Environmental sensor networks are an essential part of long-term ecological research and environmental monitoring systems.

Explanations are the foundation of science, of scientific understanding, and of scientific communication. Theories of explanation are at the heart of discourse about what makes the scientific method unique, and they define metrics for assessing the quality of scientific programs and the results they produce. Though theories of explanation have received considerable attention in the physical and natural sciences, in psychology, and in engineering, little work has been directed at explicating and articulating a theory of explanation to act as a foundation for a science of software-intensive systems design. If science is about producing explanations, then a field of inquiry aspiring to the scientific label requires an understanding of what constitutes an explanation of the phenomena it takes as its subject. Design research is about understanding artifacts and the ways they are produced, as well as how and why they have the effects that they do when they are used (or misused, or not used) in different contexts. Understanding the fundamental reasons and causes behind successful and failed, good and poor software-intensive systems is the goal of a Science of Design. To develop this understanding, the field needs theoretical constructs to act as organizers and aggregators of the results from diverse research programs. These theories, in turn, need to be assessed in terms of the explanations they produce and their explanatory power. This research, if successful, will provide the field of software-intensive systems design with a theoretical framework for carrying out such assessments. Year 1 of the proposed study will involve a program of analysis and synthesis focused on theories of explanation from the philosophy of science and the psychology of explanation. Candidate theories and constructs will be compared to the kinds of explanations put forth in published systems design research, and to the PI's own on-going design research, resulting in a pre-empirical framework describing a theory of explanation for software-intensive systems. In Year 2 the PI will construct an interview protocol based on the theory and conduct interviews with researchers in software engineering, human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and information systems. These interviews will elicit researchers' views on the kinds of explanations produced by their research and help to produce a generally applicable account of both the normative and natural explanations produced by design research. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Explanations are central to communicating scientific understanding, both between experts, and between experts and society at-large. A theory of explanation for software-intensive systems will provide a language for communicating about software-intensive systems, and help highlight where scientific understanding is lacking in the field. As complex, software-intensive systems become more pervasive in society, it will become increasingly important for system users to understand their essential nature and the design constraints that impact their structure and behavior. Explanations are also the currency of education. A theory of explanation for software-intensive systems will provide a new foundation for teaching, training, and learning in the systems development field.","title":"SGER: Explanations of Software-Intensive Systems: A Foundation for Design Science","awardID":"0639939","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7372","name":"ITR-SCIENCE OF DESIGN"}}],"PIcoPI":["549541",323681,"382749"],"PO":["565227"]},"123751":{"abstract":"Proposal Number: 0649885<br\/>PI: Lui Sha<br\/>Institution: University of Illinois<br\/>Title: Stability of Software Systems<br\/><br\/><br\/>Abstract:<br\/><br\/>Software systems for major acquisition projects have a high failure rate.

Of course, software stability would differ from stability in those disciplines because software is discrete, highly nonlinear, and exceedingly complex but stability requires active measurement and active control. Stable software systems would have capabilities for runtime monitoring, fault containment, and dependency management; however, new concepts and principles are needed to design and reason about the forms of stable software, its control and its composition.

Digital .filtering and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) techniques have been applied for the identification of protein coding genes in DNA. More recently non coding genes have been emphasized by many researchers and it is now recognized that many types of non coding RNA (nc-RNA) play a major role in living organisms. Computational identification of such RNA has therefore become of great importance. These RNAs are generated from codes in the DNA, and do not code for proteins. Instead they fold into secondary structures and perform their biological function by virtue of these structures. This is what makes the computational identification of ncRNAs very challenging: it is the secondary folding structures that need to be identified rather than primary sequence structures. Such identification cannot be done with conventional HMMs because they correspond to regular grammars which are potentially incapable of identifying most secondary structures. The theory of context sensitive HMMs (cs-HMM) was recently developed towards this goal and there is strong evidence that such HMMs have great potential to identify very complicated secondary structures found in living organisms. A detailed exploration of this idea is therefore extremely timely. This is the main goal of the proposed research. For simple RNA structures such as stem-loops, tRNA cloverleaf structures, and so on, cs-HMM based algorithms have recently been developed. Algorithms that can be used for solving the alignment, scoring and training problems of csHMMs for more complex correlations will be developed in the proposed work. In order for these algorithms to be useful in biology, extensive testing on a large variety of documented sequences will also be performed. Fast algorithms for finding the optimal state sequence of an observed symbol sequence and for training pro.le-csHMMs will be developed. Recent results show that many ncRNAs play important roles in diverse gene regulatory networks. In order to build a more realistic gene regulatory network it is crucial to incorporate ncRNA genes in the network. This is another important aspect of the proposed research.<br\/><br\/>The research is exploratory and unconventional, and is at the cross roads of cutting edge signal processing theory and modern bioinformatics. Its intellectual merit comes from the fact that a deep understanding of the theory of context sensitive hidden Markov models is developed and applied to a practically interesting problem in molecular biology. The impact will clearly be in theoretical signal processing as well as in biology, where non coding genes have been shown to be of great interest in medicine and gene regulation.<br\/><br\/>As for broader impact, it is expected that the proposed research will lead to scholarly journal publications in international journals. Examples include the journals Bioinformatics, BMC bioinformatics, Proc. of the National Academy of Sciences, Nature biotechnology, and IEEE\/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. Many conference presentations will also emerge, and so will tutorial articles at various levels of depth and difficulties.

The project focuses on TinyOS and seeks to solve difficult component composition problems that even expert developers encounter. The long-term vision is to make creating robust applications largely from existing components feasible for non-expert developers. The research is based on three complementary approaches. First, the PIs are developing tool support for giving developers advice about how to meet time constraints. Timing problems are difficult to deal with in TinyOS because they cut across component boundaries in non-intuitive ways. Second, the PIs are adding support for component interface contracts to TinyOS. Contracts verify that the \"rules\" for using a component are respected, pinpointing errors when developers misunderstand or misuse an interface, avoiding difficult debugging sessions. Finally, based on their experiences with the tradeoffs between static and dynamic timing and contract checking, the PIs are revisiting the basic abstractions and structure of TinyOS, redesigning them to be more easily checkable, and therefore more reliable.

This project is developing cryptography that is more user-friendly, fault-tolerant and secure, thus broadening its applicability to our increasingly electronic lives.<br\/><br\/>More specifically, the past study of cryptography, while very successful, has made many implicit assumptions about the environments in which cryptographic constructions operate. Such assumptions often turn out to be untrue in real-life deployments, resulting in serious security<br\/>vulnerabilities.

The investigation is performed in the context of a spoken dialogue tutoring system, where student speech provides many linguistic cues (e.g. intonation, pausing, word usage) that computational linguistics research suggests can be used to detect uncertainty. Intelligent tutoring systems research suggests that uncertainty is part of the learning process, and has hypothesized that to increase system effectiveness, it is critical to respond to more than correctness. However, most existing tutoring systems respond only to student correctness, and few controlled experiments have yet investigated whether also responding to uncertainty can improve learning.<br\/><br\/>This research designs and implements two different enhancements to the spoken dialogue tutoring system, to test two hypotheses in the tutoring literature concerning how tutors can effectively respond to uncertainty over and above correctness. The first hypothesis is that student uncertainty and incorrectness both represent learning impasses, i.e., opportunities to improve understanding. This hypothesis is addressed with an enhanced system version that treats uncertainty in the same way that incorrectness is currently treated (i.e., with additional subdialogue to increase understanding). The second hypothesis is that more optimal responses can be developed by modeling how human tutor responses to correctness change when the student is uncertain. This hypothesis is addressed by analyzing human tutor dialogue act responses (i.e. content and presentation) to student uncertainty over and above correctness in an existing tutoring corpus, then implementing these responses in a second enhanced system version. Two controlled experiments are then performed. The first tests the relative impact of the two adaptations on learning using a Wizard of Oz version of the system, with a human (Wizard) detecting uncertainty and performing speech recognition and language understanding. The second experiment tests the impact of the best-performing adaptation from the first experiment in the context of the real system, with the system processing the speech and language and detecting uncertainty in a fully automated manner.<br\/><br\/>The major intellectual contribution of the research is to demonstrate whether significant improvements in learning are achieved by adapting to student uncertainty over and above correctness during tutoring, to advance the state of the art by fully automating and evaluating user uncertainty detection and adaptation in a working spoken dialogue system, and to investigate any different effects of this adaptation under ideal versus actual system conditions.","title":"Adapting to Student Uncertainty over and above Correctness in A Spoken Tutoring Dialogue System","awardID":"0631930","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2011-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1707","name":"ADVANCED LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["488661","408297"],"PO":["564318"]},"111387":{"abstract":"Proposal Number: 0546040<br\/><br\/>Proposal Title: CAREER: Dataflow Analysis for Modern Software Systems<br\/><br\/>PI: Atanas Rountev, Ohio State University<br\/><br\/>Interprocedural dataflow analysis plays a central role in tools for<br\/>software maintenance, testing, verification, and optimization.

Enabling many research experiments with a real large-scale in-situ WSN, the overall research focuses on:<br\/><br\/>-High-level programming models for WSN,<br\/>-Resource sharing among multiple users of the testbed,<br\/>-Data collection from geographically diverse sensor nets, and<br\/>-Urban-scale air pollution monitoring. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: By providing a permanent, extensible, public testbed, CitySense should have significant impact on the development of large-scale wireless sensor network systems. The open city-wide testbed allows external groups to remotely download their software images into all the nodes in the network, or into a sensor swath when multiple groups share the testbed. Monitoring air pollution transport in a dense urban environment, the application constitutes one of the first high-resolution studies of pollution and its effect on the urban population. Moreover, CitySense will be used as a tool to teach distributed systems concepts. Outreach involves curriculum development for K-12 in sensor networks.","title":"Collaborative Research: CRI: Large-Scale Open Sensor Network Testbed for Urban Monitoring","awardID":"0551535","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"024F","name":"GENI CONCEPT\/DEVELOPMENT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7359","name":"COMPUTING RES INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":[297686],"PO":["564778"]},"116634":{"abstract":"The project funds curriculum development and operation of a summer workshop in Design Research Methods.

The prime example is the cell phone, but the emergence of many new classes of such devices is expected. These devices will improve on the cell phone by moving advanced functionality, such as always-on Internet access, high-definition streaming video, and human-centric interfaces with voice recognition. One of the key ingredients to pervasive computing is wireless communication. Mobile devices must be able to seamlessly interface to whatever communication services are available as they are moved from location to location, such as different cellular networks and wireless local area networks. Software defined radio (SDR) promises to deliver flexible solutions by implementing wireless protocols wholly in software. SDR executing on programmable hardware substrates facilitates the inter-operability, flexibility, and support for new features that pervasive computing requires. Further, SDR prevents getting locked into fixed and outdated standards that traditional hardware-centric solutions are often faced with. This project focuses on hardware and software innovations to create platforms for SDR that are both programmable and scalable to the projected bandwidth requirements for the next ten years. Innovation in a single direction is not sufficient to accomplish these goals. Rather, a multi-layered approach, consisting of innovation hardware, compiler, and algorithms, is used. Across these three dimensions, this project will develop general techniques for decomposing signal processing algorithms to exploit coarse-grained parallelism, compiler technologies orchestrating the execution of communicating sequential tasks on multicore computing systems, and platform-wide power-aware architectural techniques for supporting SDR on mobile computing devices.","title":"CSR--EHS: Collaborative Research: Hardware\/Software Co-Exploration of Scalable Software Defined Radio Platforms","awardID":"0615135","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["518174"],"PO":["561889"]},"116645":{"abstract":"Title: \"Collaborative Research: SoD-TEAM: Values at Play - Integrating Social Factors into Design\"<br\/><br\/>The focus of this project is on the development of a software design methodology, titled \"Values at Play (VAP)\" that takes values into account when developing software systems. The methodology, or set of best practices, addresses such issues as: how values can be consistently and systematically integrated into the design of software systems, how values investigations, in the context of technical design, can be made scientifically rigorous, and, the construction of a viable set of general software design principles that could lead to the integration of values across a variety of design tasks. The VAP project integrates the humanities, the arts, and social, and ethical interests into the scientific design of technological systems by specifically focusing on values in the design of games. The project involves three research activities including: 1. Development of a rigorous methodology (or, best practices) for supporting value conscious design; a handbook of the Values at Play methodology is made available in hardcopy and on the Web. This phase explores such issues as: how to identify values that might be relevant to a given design project, how to embody or express values in system design, how to engage in appraisal of whether and to what extent designers have successfully embedded target values in a given system. 2. Development of a values-in-design toolkit which includes: a) game building components to help students create games based on a values-orientation; and b) several working examples demonstrating values-to-design-feature correlations. 3. Assessment of design training interventions: the team will design several instruments to assess the values integration in the methodology and Toolkit. In addition to the research activities, this project engages faculty and practitioners in a Workshop about Values at Play. Embedding values within technological systems, and verifying that such systems actually reflects those values, is particularly appropriate using computer games since they affect larger society. This research will also be of use to educators and systems designers in the IT field considering game structures in their approaches as well as to scholars interested in the study of technology, society, and humanity. Potentially, this project might advance this line of inquiry to a pervasive, industry changing, international level of importance which not only promotes the humanistic study of these issues but enhances real products for real people.<br\/><br\/>Program Manager: Anita J.

The potential failure of these systems, as was seen in the recent North American and European power grid outages, puts safety, health, and economic concerns of vital national interest in jeopardy. To protect these vital interests, it is crucial that these engineered systems maintain rigorous control over physical properties such as the routing and quality of power flows. To control these physical properties, the system software that manages these engineered systems must monitor, evaluate, and respond to changes in the physical system, while also coordinating<br\/>computation, communication, sensing and actuation resources across heterogeneous and time-varying application requirements. However, a current lack of integration among the following system domains limits the ability of system developers to exert such precise control: (1) application-specific quality of service (QoS) semantics; (2) the QoS semantics of the system software components used to implement the application;<br\/>(3) rigorous resource management to ensure application-level QoS requirements can be met; and (4) precise information about the behavior of the system software and the physical system needed for high fidelity control.<br\/>This research takes a novel approach to integrating these system domains, which so far have been addressed disjointly, by developing mutually consistent formal and verifiable models in each system domain, designing novel policies and mechanisms for exerting precise run-time control across system domains, and supporting efficient and timely collection and dissemination of detailed behavioral information to improve run-time<br\/>control fidelity. The rigorous integration of these system domains will achieve a much greater correspondence among the system domains' semantics, establishing a foundation for revolutionary improvements in system accuracy and reliability in complex mission-critical engineered systems. In doing so, this research will advance the state of the art in engineered systems and increase system developers' ability to address key<br\/>current challenges, such as preventing (or at least mitigating) cascading power grid system failures.","title":"Collaborative Research: CSR---EHS: Semantic Domain Integration for Embedded and Hybrid Systems","awardID":"0614633","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"9199","name":"UNDISTRIBUTED PANEL\/IPA FUNDS"}}],"PIcoPI":["388044","544620"],"PO":["559883"]},"117745":{"abstract":"This project, establishing two cluster machines with some flexible networking between them in order to conduct research in various CS and science disciplines, supports, among others, the following research areas: intelligent agents, network control and management, data mining, and graph theory.

Modular structure enables both division of labor and division of knowledge, which determine how independently developers can work. Good design can also lower the cost of entry for a new developer, and simplify maintenance and evolutionary activities. For open source projects, whose life-blood is voluntary labor, design can affect the ability of a project to attract and retain new developers. These effects are longitudinal (over time), systemic (both over artifact and social structure), and nondeterministic. Open source systems inherently expose comprehensive, time-series narratives of artifact evolution, social structure, and artifact quality. The longitudinal effects of design, therefore, are observable in open source projects. In this project, the PI will conduct an interdisciplinary study of the longitudinal (long-term) effects of design in a range of different open source projects. He will gather data, analyze it, and test hypotheses in order to shed light on issues such as, how the design of the artifact influenced the structure and activities of the project team, as well as the final product. Previous research suggests that design impacts, over time, both the qualities of the product, the social structure used in its construction, and even the appeal of the endeavor to volunteers.

An improved understanding of the social processes underlying open source systems could help improve software engineering practice, and lead to faster, easier development of better software systems, in both open source and commercial settings.

Scientific Merit: The ability to design and construct nanoscale computing and memory elements is one of the most interesting challenges for bio-mimetic device engineering today. Additional challenges include the use of proteins as efficient bio-molecular machines in information processing applications, the systematic study of protein structure-function relationships, the ability to change, retain and probe states of bio-molecular machines, and the development and dissemination of simulation tools to assist such experimental efforts. This Emerging Models and Technologies for Computation (EMT) team eagerly accepts these challenges and proposes to investigate the use of transmembrane proteins (ion-motive ATP-ases) as bio-molecular statemachines, critically examining their structure, function and performance with a view to building computational state machines capable of logic operations and storage. Building on the existing tools and experience, and motivated by the potential of transmembrane proteins as tested blueprints for biomimetic molecular machines,<br\/>the team will investigate the electrophysiological response, atomic structure and thermodynamic efficiency of the Na+\/K+ ATPase from both fundamental and applied engineering points of view, at each stage asking and addressing key questions regarding their use as active nanostructures for computation.<br\/><br\/>The proposal team includes a synergistic group of researchers from Ohio University who bring together the skills and background crucial for the study of ion motive transmembrane proteins. First, we will perform steady-state and transient measurements on the Na\/K pump and investigate the structure and function by electrical and optical means of pumps altered by site-directed mutagenesis. This will allow us to identify, isolate and study specific pump conformations corresponding to a given logic state of the protein. Second, we will utilize a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to obtain high-resolution images of mutated pump<br\/>proteins (which has never been attempted before). This will lead to better structural understanding of the mechanism of ion transport needed by both this study and the bio-engineering community as a whole. Third, we will support the experimental studies with modeling and simulation efforts. Specific issues we will address will include: 1) which states of the pump cycle are the most accessible and useful for computing tasks? 2) How<br\/>do we 'read out' and 'write in' such logic states either electrically, optically (using fluorescence) or by means of STM-protein interactions? 3) What are the thermodynamic limits and efficiency for transport protein based computing? 4) How can STM atomic imaging and manipulation techniques aid in the understanding of structure-function questions of transport proteins in general and the Na\/K pump in particular? and 5) How can we disseminate existing numerical tools such as molecular dynamics simulators and develop new compact simulators to guide protein based bio-molecular machine design? These questions are a small sample of issues addressable through the unique combination of powerful experimental techniques and simulation expertise found in our team.<br\/><br\/>II.

To provide an impact<br\/>for the broader public, including Appalachian communities of southeastern Ohio, northern Kentucky and western West Virginia, we will regularly contribute to science programs on OhioU's public radio\/TV station WOUB and provide financial support and internship opportunities for their student writers. All students to be supported with this proposal will participate in NSF-funded Summer School-programs and will become users of NanoHub partnership in computational nanotechnology, and the academic personnel will disseminate<br\/>findings on transport protein devices, ensuring that results obtained from this collaboration produces maximum benefits for NSF\/NIH-supported biomimetic science initiatives, especially through external collaborators at Beckman Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.","title":"EMT: Study of Transmembrane Proteins for Biomolecular Logic & Storage","awardID":"0622158","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1691","name":"DYN COUPLED NATURAL-HUMAN"}}],"PIcoPI":[313777,"528743","490681"],"PO":["565223"]},"119407":{"abstract":"An Integrated PHY-MAC approach to secure Open-Access Wireless Networks<br\/><br\/>Abstract<br\/><br\/>This collaborative project proposes an integrated research and educational<br\/>plan for addressing many important serious security challenges, especially<br\/>at the lower layers of Open-Access Wireless Networks (OAWNs).<br\/>The goal of this project is to addres wireless security vulnerabilities in OAWNs<br\/>by defining an ubiquitous infrastructure for security and control that maintains<br\/>its open access nature for regular clients while appropriately detecting,<br\/>localizing, and isolating malicious behavior and mitigating their impact.<br\/>A unique aspect and key contribution of this project will be its focus on <br\/>protecting the lower (PHY and MAC) layers through an integrated approach that <br\/>has received scant prior attention in the context of OAWNs.<br\/>This is particularly important since the lower layers are the weakest <br\/>links of any open wireless system.<br\/><br\/>To do this, the PIs will design protocol mechanisms that, first, prevent or at<br\/>least render MAC-layer attacks difficult.

The required real-time and high-rate transfers for multimedia data severely limit the number of requests that can be serviced concurrently.

This situation has spurred much interest in efficient runtime monitoring of software systems' dynamic behavior in production environments. Most existing runtime monitoring approaches, however, suffer from three limitations: they are ad-hoc and hard to extend\/adapt; they impose too much overhead to be practical; and they are defined within only one computational layer (hardware, O\/S, VM, or software). This project will investigate and define a general, efficient runtime monitoring approach that leverages software and hardware capabilities in a synergistic way. In this approach, monitoring tasks will be specified using a language that provides suitable abstractions. These specifications will then be automatically analyzed and the monitoring tasks distributed across software and hardware layers to minimize performance overhead. This project will improve the state of the art by (1) providing hardware and software support for new monitoring activities currently neglected as impractical, (2) developing infrastructure and tools that will be made available to the research community, and (3) improving overall software quality through detection of and reaction to anomalous, erratic, or malicious software behavior.","title":"Collaborative Research: Software and Hardware Support for Efficient Monitoring of Program Behavior","awardID":"0541080","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["550999","550974"],"PO":["564388"]},"121211":{"abstract":"Emerging semantic technologies are enabling us to focus on environmental and health concepts and their interrelationships in new ways.

In this project, which will be carried out in the Genesis Group of the MIT CSAIL laboratory, a concept is a complex, cross-modal model that crystallizes out of experience. As a step toward learning how to use experience, real and surrogate, to build such models, this project will collect and devise a rich collection of cross-linked, understanding-oriented experts, each specialized to a particular representation of the world, all backed by both individual associative memories and by associative memories that span multiple representations. The memories will be populated from a stream of sentences and phrases, thereby accumulating a humanlike capacity to associate states and actions that appear in one modality with those that appear in other modalities. This project will distill and test important aspects of concept representation by building a system called the Gauntlet System in which sentences and phrases stream past a line of representation-centered experts, each of which can either interpret an element of the data in its own terms or ignore it and pass it along to other downstream experts for their consideration. The project plans to build an on-line library of representation summaries for use by other researchers interested in concept formation, robust systems and Artificial Intelligence.","title":"Understanding Concepts: An Essential Aspect of Robust Intelligence","awardID":"0646933","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2008-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6856","name":"ARTIFICIAL INTELL & COGNIT SCI"}}],"PIcoPI":["536919"],"PO":["387198"]},"122047":{"abstract":"OISE 0641474<br\/>Evans<br\/><br\/>This international workshop has several integrated components that involve focused discussion sessions and site visits to academic institutions and industrial laboratories in Finland and Sweden where senior and junior U.S. researchers will meet first with counterparts in Helsinki, then in Uppsala, to examine the likely impacts of mobile wireless technology on the Internet's future architecture.

Two common approaches to ensure reliable system behavior are: 1) Scientific foundations, tools, and architectural principles for ensuring elimination of errors, and 2) foundations, tools, and architectural principles for ensuring tolerance to such errors. While the first solution is sufficient, building completely error-free large-scale systems has been an elusive exercise as evidenced by experiences with today's engineering artifacts (e.g., recalls on vehicles, cascading power blackouts, etc). Consequently, a new approach to robust software design, development and certification is needed that addresses the increasing cost and safety implications of the current practices.

But it also presents a substantive barrier, forcing experimentalists to change their approaches to include a major computational role in experimental design itself. In particular, the rate of sequence acquisition in the case of complete genomes already exceeds the capacity of even the largest experimental lab or even the entire experimental community to investigate a significant number of the genes and demonstrate their function, which has meant that almost all information about gene function is obtained through computational predictions, and only a small fraction of those predictions are tested or validated experimentally. Yet, the predictions are used repeatedly for extensions, i.e., for creating annotations for newly sequenced genomes, leading to transitive errors and limiting the value of extant annotations and severely limiting progress. Accurate, generalizable approaches to filter experimental space by making functional predictions is just now being starting to be developed as an area of intense research. Computer science and information technology research is required to enable a deep understanding of contemporary biology as well as applications through the development of software tools that accurately can identify genes and predict their function. Such predictions need to be accurate enough that the experimental space is reduced, that the computational methods serve to filter the options and allow experimentalists to focus on the categories of new genes most likely to be useful.

While a few quantum algorithms are known, there are not general methods for quickly solving problems on a quantum computer. This project is pursuing several promising avenues of research to develop new powerful quantum algorithms.<br\/><br\/>Current quantum algorithms generally consist of operations which are common to current computers, such as NANDs, XORs, and other logic operations, with the addition of one purely quantum operation: a Hadamard transform. A Hadamard matrix is a unitary matrix with each element of equal magnitude. Hadamard matrices arise naturally when considering group structures. Some classes of functions are easy to describe in terms of Hadamard matrices. We are studying these classes for various groups to produce new algorithms for quantum computers. We believe that the cases where quantum computers outperform classical computers is related to cases where the Hadamard matrices have a low complexity, and thus enable efficient quantum algorithms.<br\/><br\/>Hadamard matrices are not only applicable to quantum computing, they are also relevant to quantum communication. When one wants to characterize a particular quantum state, the most efficient measurements one can make form a special set of Hadamard matrices which are said to be mutually unbiased. These measurements have much in common with combinatorial designs, which have been used for the design of classical experiments. It is an important open problem to know if all quantum systems can be efficiently measured in using such mutually unbiased Hadamard matrices. We are pursuing a more general formulation of this problem which encompasses both quantum measurements as well as classical designs called mutually orthogonal Latin squares. This relationship should lead to new constructions of quantum measurements and new quantum algorithms.<br\/><br\/>The third part of this proposal is uncovering the role quantum entanglement plays in constructions of mutually unbiased Hadamard matrices. Quantum entanglement is perhaps the most unusual aspect of quantum systems. Indeed, it was Einstein who (along with coauthors) described an experiment so strange he believed it was evidence against the validity quantum mechanics. Ironically, the states described, known as EPR pairs, are now used in many quantum communication protocols. Until now, there has been very little study of Hadamard matrices to consider their entanglement. We have identified several problems which relate the non-existence of complete sets of unbiased Hadamards to the inability to find certain entangled states. This relationship, once explored, may yield new insights into the power of quantum entanglement in both quantum communication and quantum computing.","title":"EMT: Quantum Complementarity and its Algorithmic Implications","awardID":"0622106","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1708","name":"QuBIC"}}],"PIcoPI":["488681","359692"],"PO":["565157"]},"118418":{"abstract":"With support from the Emerging Models and Technologies for Computation Program (EMT), the researchers at University of the Sciences in Philadelphia (USP) plan to develop a novel computational approach for studying complex biological systems. In this proposal we plan on studying a small part of the signal transduction pathway used in chemotaxis (the movement in response to a chemical). Our approach combines bioinformatics-assisted molecular modeling techniques with a novel coarse grain (CG) molecular dynamics method. The proposed work includes three major parts. First, new CG protein models and parameters will be developed to compliment the recently created CG dynamics program and CG lipid bilayer models. Second, a complex structural framework of a transmembrane signal transduction system, the bacterial chemotaxis protein complexes, will be constructed by utilizing a variety of bioinformatics and molecular modeling techniques such as primary sequence analysis, homology modeling, docking and random loop building. Third, the complex structural framework will be mapped into the CG representation of the protein and lipid bilayer. The CG simulations at the millisecond scale will be carried out to characterize structural, conformational and dynamic properties of the bacterial chemotaxis system. <br\/><br\/>The major advantage of CG dynamics simulation is that the computational demands are approximately four orders of magnitudes less than the conventional all-atom molecular dynamics, at the expense of some atomistic details. It will thus enable dynamics simulations of a biological transmembrane system to the milliseconds timescale for the first time. Since many biological events of interest (e.g. signal transduction) happen on this time scale, the proposed simulations will significantly enhance our computational capabilities in solving complex biological problems. Through the simulation, specific conformational changes as part of the signaling process in the cytoplasmic domain, which remains unknown, will be elucidated. While the results are important in themselves, they will serve to demonstrate the power of these techniques, and allow for extensions into other fields with temporal and spatial limitations. The results will accelerate the research on membrane proteins and by extension, have a broad and significant impact in a wide number of research areas, including computational biology, chemistry, biochemistry, physical chemistry, as well as related fields such as medicine, biology and physics. <br\/><br\/>The proposed work will be carried out by collaboration of a group of experts from different areas of computational biology and chemistry at USP. Graduate students from different disciplines (bioinformatics, chemistry, computer science) will be trained and perform many of the proposed studies, thus the grant will promote teaching and training of students and learning across scientific disciplines. Additionally, the results of the research will be broadly disseminated by publication in peer-reviewed journals, at national and international conferences, on web sites and in the classrooms.

SHIM will improve designer productivity by making it easier to design correct systems and will facilitate architectural exploration by providing software synthesis.

Based on asynchronous concurrent processes that communicate through rendezvous channels, SHIM can handle control, multi- and variable-rate dataflow, and data-dependent decisions.<br\/><br\/>The SHIM language will give designers a correct-by-construction way to describe concurrent systems. Based on a formal semantics, SHIM guarantees systems comply with the model, something that would be difficult to ensure by adding a library to an existing language. An efficient simulator for SHIM will allow software to be simulated before hardware is available. Because of its determinism, SHIM guarantees fidelity between simulated behavior and the final implementation. A software synthesis system will generate C that works within existing environments such as real-time operating systems. The goals of this are configurability, (e.g., providing control over what is implemented as an interrupt routine) performance, and size optimization. A formal analysis tool will statically predict deadlocks, predict performance bottlenecks, and identify other design problems. Since SHIM is finite-state and fairly high level, formal analysis of SHIM systems is practical. Like any programming system, developers need libraries to use SHIM most efficiently.

The project focuses on TinyOS and seeks to solve difficult component composition problems that even expert developers encounter. The long-term vision is to make creating robust applications largely from existing components feasible for non-expert developers. The research is based on three complementary approaches. First, the PIs are developing tool support for giving developers advice about how to meet time constraints. Timing problems are difficult to deal with in TinyOS because they cut across component boundaries in non-intuitive ways. Second, the PIs are adding support for component interface contracts to TinyOS. Contracts verify that the \"rules\" for using a component are respected, pinpointing errors when developers misunderstand or misuse an interface, avoiding difficult debugging sessions. Finally, based on their experiences with the tradeoffs between static and dynamic timing and contract checking, the PIs are revisiting the basic abstractions and structure of TinyOS, redesigning them to be more easily checkable, and therefore more reliable.

Typically, large-scale robust systems are distributed and reactive with heterogeneous components that may be designed by different contributors; some may be legacy systems and some may be un-trusted third-party programs. Recent rapid development and deployment of Internet and networked devices, such as cell phones and sensor networks, has resulted in application systems development that is vastly different from traditional software engineering: commercial of-the-shelf components, legacy components, and un-trusted components are generally unavoidable as components in such a system. Diminished designer-control over components poses a challenge: the weaker the component assumptions, the more difficult it is to build a provably-correct system or even a system that meets requirements. This project's \"science of design\" provides precise specifications for imperfect components, gives functional limits of feasible systems under different assumptions, and provides a methodology to design a robust system under weak component assumptions. The PIs anticipate that their rigorous theory of design and specification (based on adapting and extending Temporal Logic of Action -- TLA -- a program logic that expresses both programs and their properties with a single language) will deepen understanding of the relationships and trade-offs between system assurance and component-assumptions, particularly for concurrent systems. Such a design methodology (i.e., their language for specifying components and a set of tools for checking system properties) facilitate the design of larger and more secure systems. <br\/><br\/>Program Manager: Anita J.

The specific goals of the project are: to build an interdisciplinary and diverse community of faculty and students around the design of Software Intensive Systems, build a foundation for teaching the science of design to undergraduate computer science students and faculty, immerse students in a five week module in methods of creativity and conceptual representation (at NSF REU sites) and other campuses, and conduct formative assessment of impact of the SoD curriculum. The core group of four faculty leading this project are from computer science, engineering and GIS. Other participating faculties are from diverse disciplines. Together, they integrate elements of design from other disciplines with the software engineering field while remaining focused on the science of design for software intensive system. Science of Design, as it relates to software and software intensive systems, is a new area of inquiry with little existing theory or foundation. An important contribution of this educational and research project is the creation of a community of individuals from diverse disciplinary and cultural perspectives to begin establishing such a foundation. This project focuses specific efforts on the creation of an undergraduate level, curricular toolkit which is introduced through curriculum developed and evaluated as a fundamental component of the research component of this project. <br\/>This proposal addresses three opportunities for broader impact: the primary research goal is to develop a conceptual basis for the science of design as taught in undergraduate computer science curricula. As a means to attain this goal, the project will develop a multidisciplinary community that will both contribute to the SoD as it relates to software design, and influence how participants from these other disciplines, cultures and perspectives conceptualize and teach design in their own areas of expertise along with an impact on the skills of the participants as they consider and later teach the SoD; through REU programs and cross cultural collaboration there may be a positive impact on recruitment and retention of underrepresented populations in undergraduate and graduate computer science programs. This institution, located in proximity to a dozen indigenous tribal groups, is a leader in providing educational opportunities for American Indians. By consciously involving design approaches from a variety of disciplines and cultures the project anticipates a broadening of approaches and perspectives brought to bear on design both in the United States and abroad. This broader view has value and impact beyond the specific tasks related to the SoD proposal and may help to offer participants a greater understanding and sensitivity for differing views and cultural perspectives.<br\/><br\/>Program Manager: Anita J.

Over the past 10 years, the Federal Government, including NSF, DARPA, NSA, and the DoD laboratories have invested over $100M in cyber security research. In spite of some success stories on particular research or innovations, the number of attacks and their severity are increasing and the specter of very severe attacks remains. In other words, the pace of innovation in defense has lagged the pace of innovation in the offense and the expectation is for this trend increasing. <br\/><br\/>It is anticipated that the ongoing research will help improve the situation, but a focus on solving a grand challenge will likely energize the computer security community to focus on real defenses. The PI believes that by defining and developing one or more grand challenges in Cyber Security, this work can be leveraged by current and future research to demonstrate progress and ultimately success in achieving grand challenges with significant benefits to society. <br\/><br\/>This proposal identifies ground work for grand challenges by defining, articulating, and designing the grand challenge problems themselves. It proposes a number of candidate problems, taken from host, network and applications -- all of which have security needs.

It would have broad impact by dramatically speeding up the development of new materials and medicines. It would provide new secure communication infrastructure. Currently, only small-scale prototype quantum computers exist, and enormous challenges exist in scaling these devices to sizes large enough to produce meaningful practical results. Producing a large-scale quantum computer is a profoundly important goal for our nation and the world to undertake. It will require a combined effort of several disciplines of science and engineering, including, physics, materials, controls, computer science and computer engineering. This proposal funds work on the engineering of quantum computers, specifically the microarchitecture of such devices.<br\/><br\/>The microarchitecture of an ion-trap quantum computer significantly alters its capabilities. A poor microarchitecture has limited scientific value because it is unable to correctly compute the result of quantum algorithms. A good microarchitecture not only functions properly, but also reveals insights about how to build ever larger and more scalable designs.<br\/><br\/>To study the microarchitecture of a quantum computer tools are required. Quantum algorithms can consist of billions of operations. Proposals for large-scale quantum microarchitectures consist of thousands of discrete elements. It is not practical to study by hand how to map execution of every one of these billions of operations onto the thousands of available components. Instead, automated tools that perform this mapping are required for the useful study of such computer systems.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit of this work is that it studies precisely how to build a real large-scale quantum computer by focusing on such tool development. In particular, our prior work developed what is termed a computer-aided-design (CAD) suite of tools for ion-trap based quantum computers. Using these CAD tools we demonstrated the orders of magnitude more difficult challenge building a quantum computer will be. This proposal funds continued research on these CAD tools.<br\/><br\/>The particular tool development funded by this proposal is the following: implementation of more variety in the coding schemes, an overhaul of the scheduling mechanism at the heart of the CAD tool suite, and development of a collection of CAD-cells, for efficiently computing often appearing patterns of execution in quantum software. Implementing more error correction coding schemes will enable quantum computer architects to study code efficiency and specialize the coding schemes to the areas of a device where they are best suited. Updating the scheduler will enable better exploitation of parallelism (doing more than one thing at a time) and locality (having operations close together in physical space, as to minimize the time required to move them around). Finally, development of CAD cells will enable us to merge fully custom designed components into the overall CAD framework, thereby leveraging such efforts for more time and area-efficient components. Our research aim is that through a combination of these techniques we can reduce the challenges facing us in the construction of a large-scale quantum computer, thereby enabling the construction of such a device sooner in time.","title":"Quantum: Microarchitectures for Quantum Computers","awardID":"0621621","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1708","name":"QuBIC"}}],"PIcoPI":["555935","483594"],"PO":["565157"]},"119409":{"abstract":"Proposal Number: NSF-0627382<br\/><br\/>TITLE: Security and Privacy Solutions for Data-Centric Sensor Networks <br\/><br\/>PI: Sencun Zhu (szhu@cse.psu.edu), Co-PI: Guohong Cao (gcao@cse.psu.edu)<br\/><br\/>As sensor networks scale in size, so will the amount of sensing<br\/>data generated.

This coarse-grain fault model is appropriate for multicomputer networks, LANs and WANs where computers\/hosts and the communication links are unreliable. However, the coarse-grain model is unsuitable for on-chip networks in which the common faults are (a) transient faults, (b) manufacture-time permanent faults and (c) permanent faults that occur over the lifetime of the integrated chip. This project has two aims. First, it aims to quantify the susceptibility of the various components of on-chip networks (i.e., buffers, routing logic, arbiters, switches and links) to the three classes of faults in terms of their architectural vulnerability factors (AVFs), yield-adjusted throughput and mean time to failure (MTTF).

Thus values are classified by types, types are classified by kinds, etc. A strict phase distinction is maintained -- the classification of a term at level \"n\" cannot depend upon terms at lower levels.

Manually tracking and reacting to such changes is labor-intensive, error-prone, and in many cases infeasible (e.g. modern worms can causecatastrophic damages within minutes -- too small a timescale for human to respond manually). It is therefore an important and urgent research challenge to develop tools and techniques to fully automate the process of network monitoring, analysis, and response.<br\/>The research addresses the above challenge by developing a ScalableMonitoring, Analysis, and Response Toolkit (SMART). SMART allows applications to perform network-wide traffic monitoring, identifyanomalies and changes in the network state, diagnose the causes for the changes, and dynamically control the network traffic -- all in an automated fashion. By integrating practical network domain knowledge and engineering experience with solid theoretical foundations in algorithms, statistics, data mining, and machine learning, SMART is scalable, accurate, robust, and easy-to-deploy. It can significantly simplify the development and deployment of large-scale network management and security applications. To demonstrate the practical values of SMART, the research develops two significant real-world security applications using the toolkit: automated worm fingerprinting, and network-based DDoS defense.

The approach taken is to cross-fertilize abstract interpretation and robust control system analysis. The goal is to combine the scalability of the former with the domain knowledge of the latter to support the development of static analyzers for embedded control software that can address systems containing several thousand lines of code. This cross-fertilization is facilitated by collaboration with one of the leading European teams working on abstract interpretation. The research is developing techniques for automatic generation of abstract models of control-related program semantics, using related abstract interpretation and robust control formalisms. The project also develops and adapts tools for validating the control-related program semantics, as they interact in closed-loop with the physical system. The work initially pursues the verification of simple properties, such as closed-loop system stability, continuing with more complex functional properties, such as reachability analyses to detect possible actuator saturation, and presence of limit cycles. <br\/><br\/>The project currently focuses primarily on aerospace applications; however it will impact any other applicative field where computers manage physical artifacts, such as power plants, automobiles and medical devices.

This project also includes the development of a new educational curriculum aimed at bringing embedded software and control systems analysis together. This curriculum, which includes undergraduate and graduate components, aims at producing a new engineering workforce that is competent in both disciplines and knows how to use them jointly to facilitate future needs in embedded software system certification.","title":"CSR\/EHS - Certification of Safety-Critical Control Software","awardID":"0615025","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["495325","550988","362708"],"PO":["493916"]},"116638":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>0613840\/Sullivan and 0613845\/Griswold<br\/>U of VA\/U of Cal SD<br\/><br\/>TITLE: Collaborative Proposal: SoD-TEAM: Representations for a Science of Design<br\/><br\/>Our understanding of software design does not yet suffice to enable economically efficient production of new software-intensive systems, either commercial-scale or the ultra-large-scale (ULS) systems emerging as priorities for government and industry.

This project seeks to unify these various algorithms and architectures through identifying commonalities in representation and translation. As wireless data rates exceed 100 Mbps and approach 1 Gbps, the joint design of algorithms and application specific architectures is a major challenge that can benefit from new approaches to flexible algorithm and architecture integration. A new and unified approach for Application Specific Instruction Processor (ASIP) architectures for wireless systems is planned that is based on three components. First, emerging iterative receiver structures for high data rate multiple antenna (MIMO) systems that can be expressed as Factor Graphs will be analyzed. Then, the algorithm mapping to fixed application specific systems and the area, time, and power complexity for these fixed VLSI architectures will be explored. Third, since system flexibility is an important concern, architectures mapping efficiency and design exploration will be performed on programmable research ASIPs.

The field of formal verification has recently benefited from a surge of innovations in technology and in methods for combining technologies. These innovations, and especially their use in combination, are disruptive to traditional formal verification tools, which are mostly each built around a single technology.<br\/><br\/>This project seeks to harness and advance disruptive innovation in formal verification by constructing an Evidential Tool Bus (ETB) that will allow many different techniques to be applied cooperatively and in novel combinations to formal verification problems. The ETB supports the need for improved certification methods by managing the integration not only of its client tools, but also of the evidence that they supply. The goal of the ETB is to develop coherent chain of evidence from multiple sources, together with the provenance of each link in the chain. Formal logic and state machines are central concepts in verification. The ETB employs a simple ontology based on these concepts and an equally simple invocation model based on semantic interaction to create a lightweight, loosely coupled service-oriented architecture for formal analysis and verification.<br\/><br\/>The project is developing a prototype ETB, which integrates tools from SRI and cooperating universities and research organizations. The ETB prototype is being used to perform formal verifications and develop certification evidence that will be made available as exemplars through the international Verified Software Grand Challenge Repository.

The project is a collaboration among the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Analog Devices Incorporated, and Mentor Graphics, with contributions and support from several other companies. The central components are high-performance low-power communications processors and FPGAs with multi-gigabit serial transceivers. The platform is designed to be scaled through five levels of packaging: mezzanine card, carrier board, chassis, subsystem, and system. Under this award, the mezzanine card and carrier boards will be designed, simulated (physically and logically), manufactured, and demonstrated using several applications, from the domains of software radio and image processing. The chassis will be designed and simulated (for signal integrity, thermal relief, and logical function).<br\/><br\/>The firmware \/ software side of the project will be a lightweight kernel that resides on the processors, the implementation of the interconnect and support for reconfigurable logic in the FPGA fabric, and a program mapper that implements the programming model for the system. The programming model is based on components that communicate via streams. The programming model is a guaranteed bandwidth model. Applications specify bandwidth requirements on their input and output streams. The program mapper is responsible for translating these application-level bandwidth requirements into requirements on individual components, and for mapping components onto the computational and communication resources of the system so as to achieve the targeted bandwidths. The hardware of the system and the programming model are co-designed to ensure that bandwidth determinism is guaranteed from the top to the bottom of the system.","title":"CRI: Development of a Platform for Integrated Communications and High-Performance Computing","awardID":"0551710","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"4080","name":"ADVANCED COMP RESEARCH PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7359","name":"COMPUTING RES INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["563534","553855",297854,"457204"],"PO":["550859"]},"116848":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>Proposal: 0615035 <br\/>Douglas Niehaus<br\/>University of Kansas<br\/><br\/>\"CSR-EHS: Semantic Domain Integration for Embedded and Hybrid Systems\" Society is increasingly dependent on complex mission-critical engineered systems, e.g., for power grid management. The potential failure of these systems, as was seen in the recent North American and European power grid outages, puts safety, health, and economic concerns of vital national interest in jeopardy. To protect these vital interests, it is crucial that these engineered systems maintain rigorous control over physical properties such as the routing and quality of power flows. To control these physical properties, the system software that manages these engineered systems must monitor, evaluate, and respond to changes in the physical system, while also coordinating computation, communication, sensing and actuation resources across heterogeneous and time-varying application requirements. However, a current lack of integration among the following system domains limits the ability of system developers to exert such precise control: (1) application-specific quality of service (QoS) semantics; (2) the QoS semantics of the system software components used to implement the application; (3) rigorous resource management to ensure application-level QoS requirements can be met; and (4) precise information about the behavior of the system software and the physical system needed for high fidelity control.<br\/>This research takes a novel approach to integrating these system domains, which so far have been addressed disjointly, by developing mutually consistent formal and verifiable models in each system domain, designing novel policies and mechanisms for exerting precise run-time control across system domains, and supporting efficient and timely collection and dissemination of detailed behavioral information to improve run-time<br\/>control fidelity. The rigorous integration of these system domains will achieve a much greater correspondence among the system domains' semantics, establishing a foundation for revolutionary improvements in system accuracy and reliability in complex mission-critical engineered systems. In doing so, this research will advance the state of the art in engineered systems and increase system developers' ability to address key<br\/>current challenges, such as preventing (or at least mitigating) cascading power grid system failures.","title":"Collaborative Research: CSR---EHS: Semantic Domain Integration for Embedded and Hybrid Systems","awardID":"0615035","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2010-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"9199","name":"UNDISTRIBUTED PANEL\/IPA FUNDS"}}],"PIcoPI":["340015"],"PO":["565272"]},"116639":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>0613840\/Sullivan and 0613845\/Griswold<br\/>U of VA\/U of Cal SD<br\/><br\/>TITLE: Collaborative Proposal: SoD-TEAM: Representations for a Science of Design<br\/><br\/>Our understanding of software design does not yet suffice to enable economically efficient production of new software-intensive systems, either commercial-scale or the ultra-large-scale (ULS) systems emerging as priorities for government and industry.

Traditional array approaches require all antennas to transmit the same waveform and the power and phase of each antenna output are adjusted to achieve a desired transmit beampattern.

Specifically, the investigators exploit waveform diversity, i.e., the diversity offered by different sensors in a distributed-sensor system transmitting different but correlated or uncorrelated waveforms, to achieve flexible transmit beampattern designs. Waveform diversity offers a new paradigm for flexible beampattern design because of significantly increased degrees of freedom. The investigators focus on the following three application areas: 1) improved passenger aircraft protections by rending shoulder-launched guided missiles ineffective via effective directed energy systems, 2) enhanced breast cancer therapies by providing a sufficiently large focal spot using an ultrasound array under elemental power constraints, and 3) making the ocean quieter by introducing, as viable alternatives to existing systems, distributed sensor networks with each sensor output power limited to ensure the safety of<br\/>the whales and other ocean creatures.<br\/><br\/>Level of Effort Statement<br\/>At the recommended level of support, the PI and Co-PIs will make every attempt to meet the original scope and level of effort of the project.","title":"Flexible Transmit Beampattern Design via Waveform Diversity","awardID":"0634786","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":[320813,"554666"],"PO":["564898"]},"121744":{"abstract":"This award supports travel expenses for student participation in the ACM Multimedia 2006 conference, Santa Barbara, CA, October 22-27, 2006.

The requirement for scalability imposes constraints on the cost and resources of individual nodes, resulting in nodes that are imprecise, statistically varying, and unreliable. The fundamental systems challenge is to overcome these individually unreliable components by deriving strength from numbers, and to form a network that is strong, reliable, robust, and capable of meeting specific performance guarantees. This proposal seeks to develop the theoretical foundations needed to realize this vision, focusing on the vital role of randomized signal processing and decentralized network coding to address two important system attributes, scalability and robustness.<br\/><br\/>1.1 Intellectual Merits<br\/>The basis of this proposal is to develop both the theoretical foundations and constructive solutions for understanding the role of randomized signal processing and decentralized coding in distributed systems comprised of unreliable, resource-constrained elements. Motivated by the important considerations of scalability, robustness, node cost and resource limitations, and a lack of global system coordination, we propose to explore the following important research areas:<br\/>. Distributed storage and ubiquitous access to data in large-scale networks founded on a new class of decentralized erasure codes;<br\/>. Reliable communication in networks comprised of cheap, untuned radios and distributed transmitters through the novel use of randomized network coding and uncoordinated communication strategies;<br\/>. Distributed data representation and summarization based on randomized multiresolution transforms and randomized in-network signal processing.<br\/><br\/>1.2 Broader Impact<br\/>Our research is aimed at exploring the fundamental limits of randomized signal processing and decentralized coding, and the technology transfer of these theoretical constructs into the design and deployment of efficient and practical algorithms for large-scale networks. Our work will apply to a broad range of applications, ranging from computer science applications like peer-to-peer networks to system-theory-aided fault tolerant circuit design. In instrumenting this technology transfer, we will heavily leverage the implementational capabilities of the Berkeley Wireless Research Center<br\/>(BWRC), as well as the theoretical prowess of the Berkeley Wireless Foundations Center. In continuing with a rich tradition at UC Berkeley, the theoretical and algorithmic results coming out of this innovative research will be integrated into the EECS curricula at Berkeley.

The potential failure of these systems, as was seen in the recent North American and European power grid outages, puts safety, health, and economic concerns of vital national interest in jeopardy. To protect these vital interests, it is crucial that these engineered systems maintain rigorous control over physical properties such as the routing and quality of power flows. To control these physical properties, the system software that manages these engineered systems must monitor, evaluate, and respond to changes in the physical system, while also coordinating<br\/>computation, communication, sensing and actuation resources across heterogeneous and time-varying application requirements. However, a current lack of integration among the following system domains limits the ability of system developers to exert such precise control: (1) application-specific quality of service (QoS) semantics; (2) the QoS semantics of the system software components used to implement the application;<br\/>(3) rigorous resource management to ensure application-level QoS requirements can be met; and (4) precise information about the behavior of the system software and the physical system needed for high fidelity control.<br\/>This research takes a novel approach to integrating these system domains, which so far have been addressed disjointly, by developing mutually consistent formal and verifiable models in each system domain, designing novel policies and mechanisms for exerting precise run-time control across system domains, and supporting efficient and timely collection and dissemination of detailed behavioral information to improve run-time<br\/>control fidelity. The rigorous integration of these system domains will achieve a much greater correspondence among the system domains' semantics, establishing a foundation for revolutionary improvements in system accuracy and reliability in complex mission-critical engineered systems. In doing so, this research will advance the state of the art in engineered systems and increase system developers' ability to address key<br\/>current challenges, such as preventing (or at least mitigating) cascading power grid system failures.","title":"Collaborative Research: CSR---EHS: Semantic Domain Integration for Embedded and Hybrid Systems","awardID":"0615341","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"9199","name":"UNDISTRIBUTED PANEL\/IPA FUNDS"}}],"PIcoPI":["556687"],"PO":["559883"]},"114869":{"abstract":"Most waves in nature are only partially coherent, with fluctuations (thermal, quantum, or other) imparting a statistical character to their dynamics. Particularly in the nonlinear case, transport is complicated by the presence of finite correlations. Fluctuations seed perturbations and can either generate or suppress instability. In the former case, noise provides a free-energy and symmetry-breaking source, while in the latter case statistical de-phasing can inhibit nonlinear mode coupling and energy transfer. The purpose of this work is to study these effects, both experimentally and theoretically, using the nonlinear propagation of statistical light.<br\/><br\/>The starting point is the observation that fully-condensed, many-body systems can often be described by a single, macroscopic wavefunction, in complete analogy with the coherent light field from a laser. In partially-condensed systems, finite-temperature effects give rise to statistical behavior, which has correspondences in the propagation of incoherent light. This research takes advantage of these relations, interpreting many aspects of nonlinear beam propagation in fundamentally new, field-theoretic ways. The result is a unifying framework for a variety of disparate optical phenomena, leading to a series of new experimental directions. Even more than novel interpretations, though, the new perspectives suggest several types of correlation studies that have never been performed for any field. Studying such behavior is crucial to the understanding of statistical dynamics and nonlinear mode coupling, which is both fundamental to basic science and of great technological importance.<br\/><br\/>The power of optical imaging drives the intellectual merit of this work, as complicated wave dynamics relevant to (but often hidden in) other fields can be directly visualized. Indeed, there is much potential in the ability of optical systems to serve as optical simulators for modeling complex condensed-matter behavior (similar to the use of optical signal processing for highly parallel computing). From a teaching perspective, the familiarity of light and the ease of imaging give optical systems an enormous pedagogical advantage. Practically, this physics through photonics approach can be demonstrated through experiments that are relatively simple to perform, while the wave dynamics in these systems can be as complex as any topic in field theory. A strong educational component is therefore a main theme of this work, with instructional projects coherently integrated with the research plan. Results from the work will be incorporated directly into the investigators courses, both to invigorate undergraduate classes and to illustrate basic principles in field-theoretic graduate courses.

Even if the resulting higher-level image descriptors can be made, they might not prove sufficiently scaleable to enable image collection on gigapixel scales. The resulting devices may require substantial computational power, but such power is now commonplace even in hand-held, battery-powered devices. The camera sensor's output will require computation to construct a displayable image, even for the camera's viewfinder, but the potential payoff is great: we may be able to defer almost every image-making decision (e.g. all exposure settings, lighting, framing, focus, resolution, noise, time-of-snapshot, color compensation, motion compensation, flash adjustment) until after the photo is made; current digital cameras force irreversible decisions at the time of photography. The results may fundamentally change the process of photography itself, finally achieving features that were impossible with digitized film.<br\/>To achieve these ambitious goals, we will pursue change-focused imagery; adaptively sensing changes in the viewed scene rather than a temporally and spatially-fixed grid of intensity values. We will attempt to merge and extend two already-successful complementary strategies: gradient-camera methods from my own previous work, and adaptive frameless sampling from my colleagues Ben Watson (NCSU) and Dave Luebke (now at Nvidia, Inc). Gradient-based methods estimate the partial derivatives of the image field rather attempting to estimate direct, instantaneous intensity. Adaptive frameless sampling discards traditional rigid temporal and spatial sampling patterns organized as uniformly spaced pixels, scanlines, and frames. Instead, it computes sample locations dynamically, in response to spatio-temporal gradient estimates to find regions and times of greatest change. When combined with gradient and velocity estimators, it dynamically estimates edges and motion. Adaptive reconstruction creates displayable images by velocity-sensitive interpolation where sample weights depend on age and displacement.<br\/>These goals are ambitious but grounded: I do not propose to actually build new camera sensors, rendering hardware, and monitors, but instead to lay the necessary intellectual groundwork and run detailed, practical simulations. My colleagues Ben Watson and Dave Luebke will share their adaptive rendering code-base, and I also have active collaborations with partners in industry capable of taking these ideas to practice, including Microsoft Research, Adobe Systems, Inc., Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs(MERL), and Nvidia Corporation.<br\/>Intellectual merit: Pixels may become low-level implementation details, entirely internal entities for 'smarter' displays and sensors that communicate using higher-level primitives that avoid rigid latency constraints ordinarily imposed by frame-buffered capture, rendering, and display. Visualization researchers may eventually interactively explore vast datasets with reduced-latency gigapixel video. If sufficiently sparse, these same methods may make gigapixel video transmission practical.

Software patterns, descriptions of recurring design problems coupled with proven solutions, have emerged as one means to systematically collect and disseminate software design knowledge. But as the number of available patterns proliferates, the expertise needed to find and effectively use patterns increases. Current pattern collections also contain no cross-references, missing important opportunities to capture and analyze interrelationships between knowledge embedded in patterns. The research objective is to investigate the efficacy of pattern \"languages\", tightly coupled organizations of patterns supporting systematic development methodologies. Semantic Web technologies will be investigated to federate pattern collections into Web-based ontologies supporting semantic pattern relationships and computational reasoning. Research efforts will empirically investigate existing software pattern collections, develop proof-of-concept demonstrations of ontology-based pattern languages, and support collaborative creation and refinement of pattern languages. The significance of this research is to address essential and elusive difficulties of using patterns to achieve significant quality and productivity gains. In addition, semantic relationships between patterns will help organize and refine software development knowledge. Broader impacts include Web-based access to federated pattern languages, creating building blocks for future pattern language research, and using research results for pedagogical purposes.","title":"An Ontology-Based Infrastructure for Creating Software Pattern Languages","awardID":"0639164","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7372","name":"ITR-SCIENCE OF DESIGN"}}],"PIcoPI":["356244"],"PO":["564388"]},"120139":{"abstract":"For the next five years, the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks will host a summer school program in polar aeronomy and radio science (PARS).

The two weeks will be spent in a series of lectures, field trips, and experiments, at the space physics research facilities located around interior Alaska. The school has started out each year with a week in the Fairbanks area with lectures at the Geophysical Institute, and tours of the Geophysical Institute, the Poker Flat Research Range, and the HIgh Power Auroral Stimulation (HIPAS) ionospheric heating facility. Student experiments scheduled for the facilities in the Fairbanks area have been carried out during the first week of the school. For the second week of the school, the group has relocated to the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) Ionospheric Observatory at Gakona, Alaska, for additional tours and experiments. The experiments conducted during the school cover a variety of topics, including (1) observations of noctilucent clouds, (2) generation of extreme low frequency and very low frequency radio waves using the HAARP transmitter to modulate the auroral electrojet, and (3) generation of field-aligned density irregularities. Several students have presented their experiment results at major scientific workshops, and journal articles have been published on the results from PARS summer school experiments. The primary motivation for the summer school is to provide an opportunity for students to study the upper atmosphere and ionosphere at polar latitudes with practical experience built into the learning process. There is a need for more trained scientists and engineers with knowledge of the special effects that occur in the ionosphere at high latitudes. The summer school is provided to attract students with exceptional talent to become more familiar with this exciting area of study. The summer school has brought student-faculty pairs from universities around the country to Alaska.","title":"Polar Aeronomy and Radio Science (PARS) Summer School","awardID":"0631506","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2012-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"T885","name":"DIA-MASINT"}},{"dir":{"id":"06","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES             ","abbr":"GEO"},"div":{"id":"0602","name":"Division of DIV ATMOSPHERIC & GEOSPACE SCI","abbr":"AGS"},"pgm":{"id":"1521","name":"AERONOMY"}},{"dir":{"id":"06","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES             ","abbr":"GEO"},"div":{"id":"0602","name":"Division of DIV ATMOSPHERIC & GEOSPACE SCI","abbr":"AGS"},"pgm":{"id":"1523","name":"SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL"}},{"dir":{"id":"06","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR GEOSCIENCES             ","abbr":"GEO"},"div":{"id":"0602","name":"Division of DIV ATMOSPHERIC & GEOSPACE SCI","abbr":"AGS"},"pgm":{"id":"4202","name":"UPPER ATMOSPHERIC FACILITIES"}}],"PIcoPI":["542205"],"PO":["564736"]},"122339":{"abstract":"The University of California at Los Angeles proposes to develop and run a workshop o- a \"Computer Science Day\" - for the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).

This project addresses these challenges in the context of a new and powerful solver called Spike. Spike decomposes a linear system into a set of decoupled systems, and a much smaller reduced system.

Currently, such systems typically consist of a central recording center, with hundreds of hours of tapes recorded daily. There is usually no coordination between cameras, other than what is provided by human operators at the center. Existing research in surveillance is primarily focused on classical and highly studied problems such as tracking, monitoring, and recognition. Little attention has been paid on the actual coordination of cameras in a network. This lack of attention to an important aspect of surveillance systems presents opportunities for discovery that will be explored in this project. The proposed solutions to these problems will significantly advance the state of the art. Self calibration of cameras will use the vanishing line of the ground plane and the vertical vanishing point obtained by tracking people over multiple frames. Ego-motion of cameras subject to pan, tilt or zoom will be accurately measured by considering invariant trajectories in space- time volumes of video data. Relative positions between cameras, which need to be computed only once, will make use of commonly seen points of the scene if cameras can be panned to have temporary overlaps of fields of view, and survey points in the scene if overlaps are not possible. The main outcomes of this project will be (1) a set of innovative algorithms that could transform the current approach to wide area surveillance, and move it one step closer towards automated operation, and (2) an actual implementation and operational evaluation of these algorithms with real surveillance systems.<br\/><br\/>Surveillance issues that could benefit from this effort are target tracking, detection of actions, identification of activities, and recognition of tracked objects and people of interest.

This in turn has resulted in the delivery and use of systems that contain a full operating system kernel, such as Linux or one of its embedded systems variants. These trends seem certain to continue, but hardware resources will always remain limited relative to more powerful machines because embedded systems must usually be small and inexpensive and often are battery operated.<br\/><br\/>This project aims to assist the development of future embedded systems by automating the optimization process, thus allowing system developers to focus on functionality and spend much less time worrying about resource constraints such as limited memory or power. In particular, the project is creating a reusable optimization framework that takes an entire embedded system (applications, library programs, and operating system kernel) and uses profile-guided optimization to produce a new version of the system that uses much less memory, executes faster, and uses less energy. To realize these goals, the project is developing techniques that, given an embedded system with a fixed set of applications: (1) ensure that we have complete knowledge of application\/kernel interactions (using a combination of profiling and static analysis), (2) optimize the system to reduce code size, execution time, and energy usage (using binary rewriting), and (3) ensure that the resulting system can be understood, tested, and maintained.","title":"CSR---EHS: A Framework for Optimizing Embedded Systems","awardID":"0615347","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"9199","name":"UNDISTRIBUTED PANEL\/IPA FUNDS"}}],"PIcoPI":["241298","550173"],"PO":["561889"]},"122957":{"abstract":"This SGER award supports a study focused on the architectural alternatives and research challenges of next generation Cyber Physical Systems (CPS).

Most of the work of the project is to integrate them into a common workbench, called SAIL (A SAT and Induction Laboratory), which can serve as a powerful tool for design of software and hardware. SAIL will incorporate decision procedures for several commonly used theories including theories of equality over uninterpreted symbols, free constructors, and Presburger arithmetic. In addition, procedures for integrating induction into decision procedures without losing automation will be supported. A new approach for reuse of SAT techniques by creating a library called SatBox will be developed. SAIL will include a new flexible, modular approach based on SatBox to integrate the decision procedures into a SAT solver based on the Davis, Putnam, Logemann and Loveland (DPLL) framework.

The prime example is the cell phone, but the emergence of many new classes of such devices is expected. These devices will improve on the cell phone by moving advanced functionality, such as always-on Internet access, high-definition streaming video, and human-centric interfaces with voice recognition. One of the key ingredients to pervasive computing is wireless communication. Mobile devices must be able to seamlessly interface to whatever communication services are available as they are moved from location to location, such as different cellular networks and wireless local area networks. Software defined radio (SDR) promises to deliver flexible solutions by implementing wireless protocols wholly in software. SDR executing on programmable hardware substrates facilitates the inter-operability, flexibility, and support for new features that pervasive computing requires. Further, SDR prevents getting locked into fixed and outdated standards that traditional hardware-centric solutions are often faced with. This project focuses on hardware and software innovations to create platforms for SDR that are both programmable and scalable to the projected bandwidth requirements for the next ten years. Innovation in a single direction is not sufficient to accomplish these goals. Rather, a multi-layered approach, consisting of innovation hardware, compiler, and algorithms, is used. Across these three dimensions, this project will develop general techniques for decomposing signal processing algorithms to exploit coarse-grained parallelism, compiler technologies orchestrating the execution of communicating sequential tasks on multicore computing systems, and platform-wide power-aware architectural techniques for supporting SDR on mobile computing devices.","title":"CSR--EHS: Collaborative Research: Hardware\/Software Co-Exploration of Scalable Software Defined Radio Platforms","awardID":"0615261","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["535404","518034"],"PO":["561889"]},"120846":{"abstract":"Traditional single-track magnetic and optical disk storage technologies have reached their density limits. To continue the historical trend of exponentially increasing storage density, two-dimensional (2D) storage techniques, wherein bits are written and\/or read in 2D blocks, are being developed by industry. These 2D storage systems suffer from 2D intersymbol interference (ISI) due to the low-pass nature of the read\/write system. The 2D-ISI can be modeled as two-dimensional convolution of the input block with a finite-extent 2D blurring function, or \"mask\", followed by additive noise.<br\/><br\/>The well-known Viterbi algorithm (VA) provides the maximum likelihood sequence estimate (MLSE) for detection of 1D sequences on 1D ISI channels. The problem in two (or higher) dimensions is considerably more difficult, due in part to the lack of a natural order in 2D as opposed to 1D. Relatively speaking, the 2D problem is not as well understood, and the performance of known methods is less than satisfactory. In recent publications, we describe 2D ISI equalization algorithms, based on zig-zag scanning of the corrupted 2D data, that substantially outperform all previously published work, and that come very close to the 2D-MLSE bound, the theoretically best attainable performance in terms of minimal bit error rate for a given signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio. Also, we have demonstrated that the 2D correlation present in many<br\/>data files can be exploited by the 2D equalizer to achieve even further performance gains. To build on these promising preliminary results, we propose to develop a theoretical framework for efficient design and optimization of two and higher-dimensional ISI equalization algorithms, for both independent and correlated data, with both binary and non-binary (\"M-ary\") symbols.<br\/><br\/>The proposed research employs a unified approach to MLSE for independent and correlated binary and M-ary multi-dimensional data; problems are addressed by designing, analyzing and demonstrating iterative algorithms based on the turbo principle, a concept borrowed from the iterative turbo decoding algorithm that has revolutionized the field of channel coding. The PIs have a number of promising preliminary results that serve to point out additional promising areas of investigation; these preliminary results include:<br\/><br\/>An iterative row-column soft-decision feedback algorithm for 2D-ISI reduction in 2D binary data,<br\/>which outperforms the best previously published result by about 0.4 dB at high SNR.<br\/><br\/>A zig-zag 2D ISI equalization algorithm, which, when concatenated with the row-column algorithm, outperforms the best previously published result by about 0.7 dB at high SNR, and comes within 0.2 dB of the 2D MLSE performance bound.<br\/><br\/>An algorithm for joint Markov random field estimation and 2D ISI equalization, which achieves up to 2 dB SNR gains over 2D ISI equalization alone, when the original 2D binary source is correlated.<br\/><br\/>The proposed iterative algorithms use both row-column and zig-zag maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) detectors which exchange soft estimates, resulting in significantly improved data estimates compared to previously proposed row-column iterative algorithms. The benefits of adding additional scan orders to the iterative algorithm will be explored, for both 2D and 3D ISI, and for both correlated and non-correlated source data. Iterative detection will be combined with iterative decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes to perform joint decoding and detection in 2D and 3D ISI. New complexity reduction techniques will be investigated<br\/>to handle multi-dimensional ISI for sources with M-ary symbols.<br\/><br\/><br\/>Broader impacts of the proposal:<br\/>The proposed project addresses the problem of decoding and detection in multi-dimensional ISI. As such, it combines techniques from the two related yet distinct fields of expertise of the project's co-PIs: image processing (Sivakumar) and communications (Belzer). This yields a good synergy between problem formulations and known solution techniques between the two fields.<br\/><br\/>The proposed research will produce a class of iterative algorithms for ML solutions to the multidimensional ISI equalization problem, thereby significantly improving storage densities and data rates for magnetic and optical storage. The project will also benefit the emerging technology of holographic storage, wherein lasers are used to store bits in stacks of 2D pages, leading to intra-page 2D ISI, and, at higher densities, 3D ISI due to inter-page interference. The project will result in advances in error control coding for 2D and 3D storage channels, thereby enabling further increases in storage density. Finally, we expect that the novel complexity reduction techniques we propose to develop for M-ary multi-dimensional ISI channels will also be of use on 1D ISI channels, which occur in a wide variety of telecommunication applications.<br\/><br\/>The educatio","title":"New Angles on the Multi-Dimensional Intersymbol Interference Problem","awardID":"0635390","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2010-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7351","name":"THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS (TF)"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7936","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING"}}],"PIcoPI":["518515","518516"],"PO":["564898"]},"120989":{"abstract":"The purpose of this travel grant is to seek funds for student authors to attend the IEEE MASS 2006 conference.

At the molecular level, most of the relevant proteins and their interactions in the underlying biochemical network have been identified. At the cellular (systems) level, there has been a recent burst of experimental effort, enabled by state-of-the-art fluorescence microscopy technologies, aimed at delineating some of the systems level behavior, such as signal amplification, wide dynamic range of ultra-sensitivity, and flagellar motor assemblage and function. These two factors, knowledge of the underlying signaling network and availability of systems level data, make bacterial chemotaxis one of the most suitable biological systems for quantitative modeling directed at understanding at the systems level, i.e., at the central goal of systems biology. <br\/><br\/>The bacterial chemotaxis machinery can be divided into two parts: the signaling pathway and the flagellar motor. The motor has two possible states, spinning either clockwise (CW) or counter clockwise (CCW), which leads to cell's tumbling and run motions respectively. The switching of the motor between CW and CCW states is regulated by an intracellular response regulator CheY-P. Despite much experimental and modeling effort, detailed molecular level understanding of the switching mechanism is still missing. <br\/><br\/>In this proposal, we plan to address three problems related to flagellar motor switching. (1) Switching Mechanism: We propose to develop a detailed kinetic model of motor switching that is consistent with both the observed ultra-sensitivity for the steady state behavior and the recently observed distributions of the CW and CCW duration times. Both the CW and CCW duration time distributions exhibit well defined peaks whose positions depend systematically on the motor bias, or CheY-P level. Current models have failed to explain these two experimental observations consistently. (2) Effect of Noise: There are two sources of noise affecting the switching of a single flagellar motor. The intrinsic fluctuations are due to discreteness of CheY-P\/FliM binding and the switching stochasticity, and the extrinsic noise is caused by temporal fluctuations in CheY-P level in a wild type cell. We want to understand the effects of these two types of biological noise in flagellar motor switching, in particular, how they give rise to the observed motor switching pattern and its power spectrum. (3) Signal Decoding: We want to develop a theoretical framework and computational method to \"decode\" the binary flagella motor switching time series and determine the temporal fluctuations of the response regulator CheY-P at the single cell level, by separating it from the other noise sources using the model developed in (1) and (2). The measurement of CheY-P at the single cell level is crucial in understanding the upstream signaling pathway, so far direct single cell in vivo measurement of the long time CheY-P dynamics is still not available, our approach represents one of the most promising ways of obtaining this important information. <br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed research represents one of the first systematic efforts to explain the recent single cell switching time distribution measurements through computational modeling. The project, if successful, will elucidate the molecular level mechanism of flagellar motor switching behavior.

They arise in partial differential equation solvers, optimization techniques, and statistical modeling. Innovations in computer hardware, such as multicore processors and scalable multiprocessors offer tremendous performance potential, while posing significant challenges for the design of efficient solvers. This project addresses these challenges in the context of a new and powerful solver called Spike. Spike decomposes a linear system into a set of decoupled systems, and a much smaller reduced system. Such a novel decomposition results in a much reduced level of memory references and interprocessor communications, at the cost of a modest increase in the number of arithmetic operations.<br\/><br\/>This project investigates fundamental numerical, algorithmic, and software development aspects of Spike. It addresses matrix reordering, storage schemes, underlying direct and iterative solvers, error analysis, and comprehensive validation. It directly focuses on emerging hardware platforms by minimizing memory references and maximizing concurrency. The project also aims to create a toolkit that can automatically provide a non-expert user with the most efficient version of Spike, based on the underlying hardware characteristics. The project also integrates Spike into a state-of-the-art quantum-scale nanoelectronics simulation environment, NESSIE, to demonstrate true application performance. The Spike toolkit is a general-purpose software package useful in a wide variety of scientific computing applications. The broader impact of such a solver, which is well well-suited to emerging platforms, is tremendous. By integrating Spike into NESSIE, this project has significant impact on quantum-scale modeling environments. The project makes significant educational and outreach contributions through the development of novel instructional material, new courses, classroom projects, and software.","title":"Collaborative Research: Developing a Robust Parallel Hybrid System Solver","awardID":"0635196","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7351","name":"THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS (TF)"}}],"PIcoPI":["456928"],"PO":["362818"]},"120825":{"abstract":"Applied Algorithms: Technology Dissemination from The<br\/> Algorithms Toolbox<br\/><br\/>Over the past decades, the field of algorithms has developed a toolbox of theoretical techniques that let computer systems to do more with less---to solve harder problems more quickly, using less memory, less communication with other computers, and less of a human user's assistance.

This threatens the existing integrated circuit design paradigm by endangering the functional correctness of the designs and by reducing yield. Statistical computer-aided design tools have been recently proposed as a way to deal with variability. Much of variability, however, is systematic rather than random, including strong spatial correlations. In that case, statistical techniques may not be sufficient to maintain good yield. An alternative and orthogonal approach is the use of adaptive circuit fabrics that seek to guarantee and enforce a specified behavior in circuits even in the presence of underlying process variation. These techniques rely on sensing the process and environmental conditions and adjusting certain circuit properties to keep the design within its specifications. <br\/><br\/>The objective of this research is to develop a formal approach to automated circuit synthesis onto adaptive circuit fabrics. The adaptive design paradigm for integrated circuits enforces predictable behavior through synthesizing adaptive circuit fabrics along with the target design. The desired outcome of this research is a methodology that preserves the foundations of a traditional design flow. The design synthesis tools themselves insert sufficient adaptivity to guarantee specified power, performance, and yield levels. This research will jointly develop the modeling and algorithmic aspects of adaptivity insertion, and will also explore new circuit-level techniques for adaptive behavior at low levels of granularity.","title":"Formal Techniques for Adaptive Circuit Fabrics","awardID":"0541330","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2011-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["535118"],"PO":["562984"]},"120804":{"abstract":"The abundance of digital media and the availability of popular software tools to edit, reformat, and manipulate these media has raised fundamental issues of authenticity, trust, and forensic analysis.

The PI propose to design and prototype a new network architecture, Cabo (Concurrent Architectures are Better than One), which resolves this problem by separating infrastructure providers (who own and manage the physical network infrastructure) from service providers (who deploy end-to-end services to users). Using Cabo, service providers will reserve network resources (i.e., virtual nodes and links) on equipment that may span one or more infrastructure providers. The separation of network service providers from infrastructure providers also allows a single service provider to construct end-to-end services; it also allows a service provider to operate multiple virtual networks, each of which is tailored to a specific application. For example, one virtual network may provide strict security guarantees but may not provide complete reachability to all destinations, while another virtual network may guarantee global reachability for applications that do not require strong security guarantees. The outcome of this project will be: (1) the design and implementation of a substrate that service providers can use to deploy new network architectures and services, and (2) investigation of example scenarios where Cabo can provide better security, robustness, and end-to-end performance guarantees. Cabo's initial design leverages virtualization, tunneling, and new experimental platforms for network protocols and architectures, including the PIs' own Virtual Network Infrastructure (VINI), which the PIs plan to use to prototype and evaluate their ideas.

This is due to several major problems: 1) At the network layer, current routing algorithms do not have any mechanisms to cope with the detrimental effects of fading and shadowing inherent in wireless channels, since these routing algorithms are based upon a disk model for wireless channels that takes into account path loss, but not fading and shadowing. 2) At the data link and physical layers, current transmission schemes do not properly explore the broadcasting nature of wireless transmissions to improve link reliability. 3) The lack of a joint design across the network, medium access control (MAC), and physical layers renders it difficult to optimize network performance. This project aims to develop a framework of cross-layer cooperative communications to substantially improve the performance of multi-hop wireless communications. Specifically, the cross-layer design framework provides a unified approach across the network, MAC, and physical layers, where routing algorithms along with MAC schemes ensure node cooperation, while the novel error-control code (ECC) achieves maximum coding and diversity gain enabled by node cooperation.

The U.S. organizer is Eric S. Howard, The Fulbright Academy of Science and Technology, Cape Elizabeth, Maine. The foreign collaborators are Dr. Khalid Temsmani, Dr. El Majid Zayer and Dr. Ilhame Laaziz, all from the Directorate of Technology, Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research in Rabat, Morocco. A primary goal of the workshop is to develop a vision and mission statement for a digital initiative covering the Maghreb region (i.e., Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia). The meeting will bring together key constituents so that this vision can be realized: content development, management structures, networked infrastructure, research and educational applications, and training for digital managers and users. The findings will be incorporated in a report and plan of action that can inform government agencies, libraries, universities, research institutes and grant-making entities. US researchers and students will be involved in the process. Their role will be to review the background papers from the January 2006 Alexandria, Egypt workshop on the digital library and digital infrastructure, and to prepare additional ones to fill critical gaps in our knowledge as it relates to the Maghreb region. Representatives from North African countries as well as UNESCO are expected to attend. <br\/><br\/>Intellectual merit: Efforts to extend and enhance internet connectivity and content access to the Maghreb region are long overdue. The proposal, building on the earlier workshop in Alexandria takes another important step forward toward building a regional resource, connecting to the global knowledge environment that will serve multiple purposes including advancing research capacity and educational resources. The success of this long-term process is dependent upon social and organizational actions as much as upon technology advances. The workshop is to connect important players throughout the region and to build linkages to high-speed networks and governance structures in the developed world. It will identify existing regional efforts and prompt new efforts to collect, organize and make generally available materials related to the cultural heritage of the region, which is significant for US scientists. The Fulbright Academy of Science and Technology has the expertise and experience to organize the meeting and disseminate its findings to a large audience. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: Access to digital information in developing countries is a critical issue of international concern. The World Summit on the Information Society in Tunisia in the fall of 2005 significantly enhanced the interest of entities in Northern Africa with respect to the digital world. This workshop is an important step in the efforts to include North Africa in the global mainstream of scientific and educational communication which involves co-sharing of globally distributed digital content. One area of interest is a digital archive, the creation of a networked digital library covering the cultural heritage of the Maghreb region to facilitate access to related cultural heritage resources held by different institutions around the world. The workshop will promote a broader discussion of the potential of digital libraries to advance knowledge and to foster international cooperation. It should result in dialogues, new discourse communities, intellectual programs of research and scholarship and coordinated infrastructure building. US junior scientists and graduate students are expected to participate in the workshop.

Though each bacterium is autonomous with respect to metabolism and reproduction, together they make up a multicellular organism. A swarm is a predatory collective that moves and feeds cooperatively, hunting together and pooling extracellular enzymes when digesting prey bacteria. When food runs short, the hundreds of thousands of swarm cells change their behavior to initiate a self-organized program that builds densely packed aggregates, called fruiting bodies, within which rod shaped cells differentiate into spherical, starvation-resistant spores. If a moving object, such as the leg of an insect, comes in contact with a fruiting body, the entire package of spores -- the fruiting body -- will likely be picked up and carried as a unit by the insect. This way, if carried to a new food source (toward which the insect was heading), the thousands of spores can germinate and emerge as an \"instant\" swarm, rather than having to re-establish a swarm from a single cell. Understanding the self-organization of swarms and fruiting bodies has potential impact for understanding the development of multi-cellular organisms, possibly including certain birth defects.<br\/><br\/>We will develop a multiscale 3 dimensional (ED) computational model of Myxobacterial fruiting body formation based on very short range (cell contact) interactions, differentiation and motility. We will analyze the effect of particular mutations on fruiting body development, comparing experiments with simulations for improving the model. Single scale models of biochemical and cellular networks are unable to capture the complexity, for even very basic biological phenomena occurr over diverse space and time scales. This is why it is crucial to determine how best to combine models at different scales and how the combination of several different types of models impacts the accuracy of the general multiscale model. These models are typically run as an iterative workflow over a distributed system. Management of these distributed workflows can be complicated to an end user and necessitates a convenient descriptive model that is data and result oriented, rather than task oriented. We will implement our multiscale models in a distributed problem solving environment. This environment will allow easy configuration and manipulation of the workflows to perform analysis of biochemical and cellular networks through an extension to the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). Proposed 3D computational model will also serve as a tool for analyzing mechanisms for building other multicellular structures dependent on cell contact signaling.<br\/><br\/>We will disseminate all results in an easily deployable bundle of the proposed Systems Biology Toolkit (SBT) to model molecular and subcellular levels, and the CellAggregate package to model the multicellular level.

At best, this imposes a tremendous cost on industry. Worse, it compromises critical infrastructure that increasingly relies on the Internet, such as power and emergency services. The difficulty of network management derives from the fact that the Internet was invented without a network management architecture. Rather, there are a plethora of after-the-fact management tools and objects.<br\/><br\/>This project is a ground-up redesign of network management based on three core concepts. First is a low-level, self-configuring communication channel that allows software network managers to discover devices and other managers. This channel allows the management system to function even when higher level protocols do not. Second is an abstract interface that allows network modules to represent themselves in simple ways. This abstraction allows management systems to understand the network without understanding the details of protocol operation. Third is a declarative configuration language that allows human managers to specify network operation in goal-oriented terms. This language allows managers to focus on what the network is supposed to accomplish, instead of how.<br\/><br\/>This research will reduce the manpower and expertise needed to manage networks, increase their reliability, and ultimately lead towards largely self-managing networks.<br\/><br\/>This research will be tested and deployed in Emulab, a large network testbed used by thousands of researchers.

Recent work shows that nanomagnets can (1) be configured to realize a universal logic gate (which can be used to implement any Boolean function) and (2) do not possess the disadvantages of the early, bulky, ferrite core magnets. This work will investigate lithographically defined nanomagnets within the quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) architecture scheme - where the direct physical interaction between individual nanomagnets yields logic functionality.<br\/><br\/>The work proposed here aims to make the jump from studying logic gates to studying simple circuits.

Common to the various scenarios of hybrid networks are infrastructure nodes that act as relays for intra-network communications and as gateways for communications with external entities. Infrastructure nodes are typically connected to a powerful \"backbone\" with high capacity and low latency. Hybrid networks have been proposed in the literature for providing relief to the scalability problem of vanishing per node throughput in ad-hoc wireless networks. However, these studies have also shown that to restore scalable throughput, infrastructure nodes have to scale at the same rate as the user nodes, dooming this approach economically. When multiple users share the same link, wireless channels behave as \"leaky pipes\" interfering with each other. A totally new dimension is introduced by allowing nodes to cooperate. Cooperation among user or infrastructure nodes has the ability to convert \"leaky channels\" into high capacity multidimensional manifolds. A central question that CHARIoT seeks to answer is: Can cooperation among infrastructure nodes resolve the scalability problem of hybrid networks in the sense that in a cooperative regime, non-vanishing per node throughput is achievable even when the number of infrastructure nodes scales considerably slower than the number of user nodes? <br\/><br\/>Intellectual Impact: The proposed research seeks to answer pivotal fundamental and design questions on the role of hybrid networks and cooperative regimes as part of the next generation Internet.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: Advances in wireless technology and consumers demand for unfettered access usher in an era in which personal computing devices will become pervasive. This will lead to new communications paradigms that cannot be addressed by conventional network architectures.

Using the data from the simulations, new methods of visualizing the flow at interfaces are tailored to each phenomena utilizing various techniques including surface creation from particles, identification and tracking of critical points in 3D flows, streamline placement, and anisotropic lighting for simulated rheoscopic fluid suspensions.","title":"Collaborative Research: MSPA-MCS: Simulation and Visualization of Flow at Interfaces","awardID":"0625264","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7453","name":"GRAPHICS & VISUALIZATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["456660"],"PO":["562984"]},"119450":{"abstract":"Nikita Borisov<br\/>Detecting and Preventing Attacks with Vulnerability Signatures<br\/>University of Illinois, Urbana-Champagne<br\/>0627671<br\/>Panel P060969<br\/><br\/><br\/>Abstract<br\/><br\/>Computer intrusions are an ever-present reality on the Internet, and<br\/>there is a pressing need to protect applications from their harmful<br\/>effects.

In the physical world attribution is achieved through forensic evidence, but constructing such evidence is uniquely challenging on the Internet.<br\/><br\/>This project is developing a novel architectural primitive---private attribution, based on group signatures--that allows any network element to verify that a packet was sent by a member of a given group. Importantly, however, actually attributing the packet to a particular group member requires the participation of a set of trusted authorities, thereby ensuring the privacy of individual senders.

Biological systems provide a source of inspiration in tackling this problem.<br\/>Biological systems exhibit degeneracy: they have multiple ways of achieving goals. This results in great robustness and flexibility: such systems survive and repair damage, and with only a small change of parameters the same process that builds a human hand can also make a lion's paw or a bat's wing. The goal of this project is to learn and formalize engineering principles that will enable us to design and build systems that have the same level of precision, flexibility, and robustness as biological systems.<br\/>The investigators intend to capture engineering principles through the design and construction of programming languages based on geometric abstractions. Geometric abstractions are used to hide the fact that the system is made up of discrete individuals and allow specification of requirements in terms of the behavior of the space occupied by the aggregate rather than the behavior of individuals. Programs expressed with their new languages and tools may have unfamiliar properties.<br\/>The languages developed will be targetted progressively from simulators and robots to biology. One ultimate goal of this research is to devise languages appropriate and effective for programming biological cells. Biological cells are plentiful and have their own energy production systems. In order to be both powerful and practical in programming cells, linguistic constructs must map onto cellular mechanisms, programs must be built out of reusable components, and the runtime costs of components must be measurable.

Proto expresses behavior in terms of four principles of design-spatial processes, aggregate state, active process maintenance, and homeostasis-while making no explicit reference to individual devices or to the communication among them.<br\/>The results of this research will have a broad impact in both engineering science and applications. One inspiration for amorphous computing is the recent astonishing developments in molecular biology and in microfabrication, promising tiny cheap devices which might be mixed into materials that are produced in bulk, such as paints, gels, and concrete. The engineering principles which this work seeks to uncover will make it possible to program complex behavior in such smart materials. Another application comes from biological computation, where these principles could be applied to program biofilms to have predetermined behaviors. Finally, the principles learned during investigation may reflect back into better understanding of the biological systems which inspire them, as well as promoting better collaboration between biologists and computer scientists.","title":"BIC: Biologically-Inspired Robust Space\/Time Programming of Sensor\/Actuator Ensembles","awardID":"0621897","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1705","name":"BIOLOGY & INFORMATION TECHNOLO"}}],"PIcoPI":["485691",313642],"PO":["565223"]},"117394":{"abstract":"Proposal Number: 0617883<br\/>PI: Baruch Awerbuch <br\/>Institution: Johns Hopkins University <br\/>Title: SGER: Scalable adversary-resistant routing <br\/><br\/><br\/>Abstract<br\/><br\/>This research advocates a concept of reputation-based routing as a way to achieve secure routing without compromising scalability.

The investigators employ a combination of mathematical analysis and computer simulation to study the design implications of such networks. The objective of the project is to obtain practically motivated and theoretically sound design and performance insights for heterogeneous networks.

The major impacts of this work are establishing the key design principles for the next generation of sensor network architecture and creating such reference architecture.

Two advantages of optical networking technology over present-day networking technology that will enable the envisioned solution are: (i) the ability to offer bit-rate-, format- and protocol-independent services, which is a direct result of optical transparency; and (ii) lower capital and operational expenses in networks, owing to a significant reduction in conventional optical-electronic-optical (OEO) conversions in the network. Since optical devices behave very differently from their electronic counterparts or may not even have electronic analogs at all, it is clear that the optimum optical network architecture (in terms of cost and performance) will not be the same as the present electronic network architecture of the Internet. A key difference between current networks (and their linear extensions) and the optical networks that the principal investigators envision is the time-scale at which network reconfiguration occurs. For the foreseeable future, network reconfiguration in the optical layer will remain slow and quasi-static. However, optimally designed all-optical networks will be dynamic and require reconfiguration on much shorter time-scales. Such architectures will significantly lower the cost per bit for communication and will enable access of high rate services to the masses relatively soon, whereas electronic architectures will continue to serve only high-end users for many years to come. Developing an optimal optical network architecture will involve a restructuring and optimization of the existing network layer structure by: (i) treating architecture, protocols, and the physical layer as a single entity with strongly interacting, but distinct subsystems, and (ii) employing foreseeable technology as well as suggesting revolutionary hardware technology to exploit the benefits of optics wherever possible. The resulting intelligent optical network will be dynamically reconfigurable, and will enable various new applications by seamlessly optimizing network performance for all. Based on a system-wide optimization, the most efficient switching, routing and transport mechanisms will be developed, which will likely include electronic packet switching as an important overlay atop a much higher-speed network. The enabling architectural concepts in this research are: (i) optical flow switching (OFS) and its implications on physical and higher layer architectures, and (ii) impairment aware routing.<br\/><br\/>The broader impact of this research will be felt in broadband network applications and potentially will facilitate major advances in interactive distant learning; telemedicine; instant access to all knowledge and information (virtual libraries); and immersive virtual presence and pervasive, mobile wireless networks. Education and research will be integrated through multidisciplinary environment of this program. MIT will focus on (i) preparing a skilled and diverse workforce, including minorities and women, (ii) generating a curriculum which is research-inspired, but also industry practice-oriented, (iii) integrating engineering, technology, and business to stimulate technology transfer, and (iv) promoting education to the broader community.

The goal is to understand how humans perceive motion . In other words, to understand what goes on inside a human's brain when he, or she, looks at a group of birds flying or snowflakes falling. The proposal is interdisciplinary and combines computational theory, psychophysics and physiology. The computational theory provides a mathematical model for how humans process motion. The theory is implemented by computer algorithms, which are applied to a motion sequence of images, and which predict the estimated velocities of motion and other properties. These motion sequences of images are pseudo-realistic, in the sense that they appear to be natural images (e.g. of flying birds, or snow) but instead are artificial parameterized models (which enables us to design controlled experiments by altering the parameters). The psychophysical experiments compare the predictions of our theory with the performance of human subjects performing a range of motion estimation tasks. These experiments address issues such as, what types of motion stimuli are people expert at perceiving? The physiological experiments attempt to pin down where motion processing takes place in the brain. In particular, we study the activity of neural cells (neurons) in different parts of the brain during motion perception. It is anticipated that understanding how the human visual system processes motion will enable us to develop more robust and powerful computer vision algorithms which will have many technological applications (e.g. for robotics and automated medical diagnosis). In addition, understanding how neurons perform computations is central to the entire enterprise of neuroscience in its attempt to give a scientific account of the brain mechanisms underlying our mental life.The grant will help encourage underrepresented groups by supporting a female postdoctoral researcher. The grant will include data sharing of the multi-electrode recordings of the physiological experiments and, in addition, we will make available the code for making novel pseudo-random stimuli.

An example is census data, an invaluable source of socioeconomic data. Simple approaches for limiting disclosure, such as removing identifying attributes like social security number and name, are not sufficient because combinations of other information in the data can help identify individuals in the data, especially when the data can be linked to external databases. It is this linkage, and in general, the property of data that it is often explicitly linked to other data, that is the focus of this project. <br\/><br\/>In linked data, data records are linked through relationships between records. Examples include data about students and the classes they took where the links are the association between a student and the classes she took; data about network packets and the routers that forwarded these packets, where the links are the association of packets to routers; or data about people and their social network, where the links are the social relationships between people. It is the explicit representation of these links in the data that violates some of the key assumptions of prior work. This research spans the whole spectrum from motivating applications of linked data, to novel privacy models and practical anonymization algorithms, to new techniques for attacking and analyzing anonymized data.","title":"CT-T: Collaborative Research: Preserving Utility While Ensuring Privacy for Linked Data","awardID":"0627680","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2011-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"H309","name":"CIA"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7371","name":"CYBER TRUST"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7456","name":"ITR-CYBERTRUST"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["525848","448955"],"PO":["543481"]},"119342":{"abstract":"This project considers broadening the reach of the Internet by extending it to support large-scale disconnection tolerant and opportunistic connectivity.

Since structure is hard to maintain in DTONs, the project uses unstructured building blocks. The fundamental problem of routing is accomplished using efficient, unstructured methods, primarily random walks. While unstructured methods work well in special underlying graph structures, it is an open problem of how to use unstructured search for point-to-point connectivity (equivalent to \"needle-in-a-haystack\" indirections). DTONs are modeled using a new combinatorial object: time-evolving graphs represented algebraically as tensors. The actual protocols for random walks are biased using the new notion of weak-state that is learned locally or disseminated globally.

It primarily focuses on sparse principal component analysis (PCA) and the related sparse canonical correlation analysis (CCA), but also intends to explore sparse variants of methods such as correspondence analysis and discriminant analysis. The motivation for developing sparse multivariate analysis algorithms is their potential for yielding statistical results that are more interpretable and more robust than classical analyses, while giving up as little as possible in the way of statistical efficiency and expressive power. The investigators have derived a convex relaxation for sparse PCA as a large-scale semidefinite program. The proposed research first studies the theoretical and practical performance of this relaxation as well as the computational complexity involved in solving large-scale instances of the corresponding semidefinite programs. In a next step, it focuses on extending these results to the other multivariate data analysis methods cited above. <br\/><br\/>Principal Component Analysis (or PCA) is a classic statistical tool used to study experimental data with a very large number of variables (meteorological records, gene expression coefficients, the interest rate curve, social networks, etc). It is primarily used as a dimensionality reduction tool: PCA produces a reduced set of synthetic variables that captures a maximum amount of information on the data. This makes it possible to represent data sets with thousands of variables on a three dimensional graph while still capturing most of the features of the original data, thus making visualization and interpretation easier.<br\/>Unfortunately, the key shortcoming of PCA is that these new synthetic variables are a weighted sum of all the original variables making their physical interpretation difficult. The proposed research will study algorithms for computing sparse PCA, i.e., computing new synthetic variables that are the weighted sum of only a few problem variables while keeping most of the features of the original data set. Sparse PCA is a hard combinatorial problem but the investigators have produced a relaxation that can be solved efficiently using recent results in convex optimization. The investigators plan to study the theoretical and practical performance of this relaxation and extend these results to other statistical methods.","title":"Collaborative Research: MSPA-MCS: Sparse Multivariate Data Analysis","awardID":"0625409","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0304","name":"Division of MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES","abbr":"DMS"},"pgm":{"id":"7454","name":"MSPA-INTERDISCIPLINARY"}},{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0405","name":"Division of OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE","abbr":"SES"},"pgm":{"id":"7704","name":"Science of Learning Activities"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2878","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CCF"}}],"PIcoPI":["500272"],"PO":["565286"]},"119353":{"abstract":"Any unneeded bit transmitted from a wireless node harms the network in two ways: it wastes the power and bandwidth of the node itself, and it creates interference for other nodes.

As bits we propose to use single electron spins in colloidal quantum dots (cqdots). Every cqdot has a specific resonance frequency at which the absorption of a photon can lead to the formation of a trion state (two electrons and one hole confined within a quantum dot). Trion states have large electric dipole moments and can therefore interact over distances of the order of 10 nm. We will leverage the polarization of the illuminating light and the Pauli exclusion principle to control trion formation and subsequently detect the spectral effect of dipole-dipole interactions between cqdots spaced 5 to 10 nm apart. In this manner, we have as a long-term goal the physical realization of theoretical schemes for quantum computing. On the way to this goal, we will explore simplified approaches that are also very interesting from the perspective of classical computation and data storage. <br\/>For the three-year period of the proposed research, our primary contribution to the quest for all-optical classical and quantum computation will be to address the challenge of nanometer positioning of colloidal quantum dots and to study their optical interactions. Our approach will be to combine self-assembled DNA scaffolds with site-specific binding elements to produce an array of optically active colloidal quantum dots. Self-assembled DNA scaffolds leverage the intrinsic specificity of Watson-Crick base-pairing to organize millions of atoms into close-packed arrays of the familiar double-helical structure with nanoscopic precision. Modern synthesis methods allow decoration of specific atoms in the DNA structure with chemically reactive groups. These reactive groups can be chosen to form covalent links to molecules that stabilize the surface of colloidal quantum dots. By placing the reactive groups at specific sites on the DNA scaffold, pairs of dots and linear or two-dimensional arrays of dots will be patterned, with a spacing that favors quantum mechanical interactions between dots. The resulting structures will be characterized by scanning probe microscopy and the interactions probed by optical pump-probe measurements.<br\/>The research will be carried out by a cross-disciplinary research team at the University of California Santa Barbara that is anchored by expertise in self assembly of DNA, the synthesis of colloidal quantum dots and their attachment to functionalized elements at specific locations (Fygenson), and expertise in quantum-optics and solid-state experiments analyzing coupled quantum dots embedded in bulk semiconductor material (Bouwmeester). We will collaborate strongly with Paul W. K.

The role of storage in sensor networks has often been overlooked since flash memory has been assumed to be inefficient energy-wise. The emergence of new NAND flash technologies significantly alters this tradeoff, and measurements show that the cost of storage is now two orders of magnitude cheaper than communication and comparable to that of computation. This development calls for a significant rethinking in sensor network design and articulates a vision where sensor nodes will be equipped with high-capacity local flash storage. The STONES project proposes fundamental cross-disciplinary research aimed at redesigning sensor software and platforms by making the role of storage central in these systems. STONES provides a rich data management stack that employs a layered architecture similar to a network protocol stack. This stack comprises three layers: (i) an object storage layer that supports flexible object types optimized for energy and memory-constrained systems, (ii) a local database layer that supports power-constrained query processing using locally archived and indexed data as well as multi-resolution storage, and (iii) a distributed data management layer responsible for ensuring data availability despite node failures.

At best, this imposes a tremendous cost on industry. Worse, it compromises critical infrastructure that increasingly relies on the Internet, such as power and emergency services. The difficulty of network management derives from the fact that the Internet was invented without a network management architecture. Rather, there are a plethora of after-the-fact management tools and objects.<br\/><br\/>This project is a ground-up redesign of network management based on three core concepts. First is a low-level, self-configuring communication channel that allows software network managers to discover devices and other managers. This channel allows the management system to function even when higher level protocols do not. Second is an abstract interface that allows network modules to represent themselves in simple ways. This abstraction allows management systems to understand the network without understanding the details of protocol operation. Third is a declarative configuration language that allows human managers to specify network operation in goal-oriented terms. This language allows managers to focus on what the network is supposed to accomplish, instead of how.<br\/><br\/>This research will reduce the manpower and expertise needed to manage networks, increase their reliability, and ultimately lead towards largely self-managing networks.<br\/><br\/>This research will be tested and deployed in Emulab, a large network testbed used by thousands of researchers. Methods hardened in Emulab can serve as the basis for management of the GENI infrastructure, where the ideas can be further tested and refined. GENI in turn will serve as a proof-of-concept for industry adoption.","title":"NeTS-FIND: Collaborative Research: Towards Complexity Oblivious Network Management","awardID":"0626978","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7631","name":"ITR-NeTS"}}],"PIcoPI":[316440],"PO":["565090"]},"119453":{"abstract":"PROJECT ABSTRACT<br\/>CT proposal #0627682<br\/>\"Violations in computer and information security\"<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>Anchored in the human factors engineering discipline, this research explores systematically the reasons or factors contributing to computer and information security (CIS) violations.

In biology, such relations arise because the distribution of resources (e.g., energy and nutrients) to individual components (e.g., cells) is a dominant design constraint, determining what sorts of organisms can evolve through natural selection. For example, vascular systems deliver oxygen to every cell in the body, and as body size increases, network constraints limit the metabolic rate of individual cells. This is similar to wire scaling issues that arise with increasing chip sizes. The mathematical derivations are complicated, but they rely on a few basic assumptions: (1) Resources are distributed through internal space-filling (fractal) networks; (2) Terminal units in the network (e.g., capillaries) are of invariant size; (3) The design is optimized to maximize metabolic rate and minimize transport times. By combining these assumptions with fundamental physical constraints (e.g., organisms are 3-dimensional) and conservation laws (e.g., conservation of matter and energy), the exact scaling metabolic relations have been derived in biology.<br\/> <br\/>The project will apply concepts of metabolic scaling to three areas of information processing: i) the wiring of mammalian brains as reflected in the distribution of gray (neurons, the information processors) and white (axons, the information transmitting fibers) matter; ii) chip microarchitecture with regard to wire\/transistor scaling and power efficiency; and iii) traffic on the Internet as a function of the quantity of information being processed and the terminal units (access points) in the network. The research has three phases: i) Collect and evaluate existing scaling laws and empirical rules of thumb; ii) Derive these scaling relations from first principles; and iii) Develop analytical and computer simulation models that make quantitative, testable predictions. The three topics represent a logical progression of information processing systems, starting with the brain (based in biology with its three dimensions and electro\/physical transport systems), then moving to silicon-based chip design (still tied closely to physical processes, geometries, and conservation laws), and finally moving to the Internet (where geometry has a physical component but is less constrained and conservation laws are not well understood).","title":"BIC: Collaborative Research: A Biologically Motivated Scaling Theory for","awardID":"0621900","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1705","name":"BIOLOGY & INFORMATION TECHNOLO"}}],"PIcoPI":["461864"],"PO":["565223"]},"119222":{"abstract":"Carrier-Assisted Routing in Mobile Networks<br\/><br\/>In terms of handling node mobility in various mobile networks, two schools exist. The traditional connection-based model is built on the premise that the underlying network is connected, and views node mobility as undesirable. The mobility-assisted model considers mobility as a desirable feature, where routing is based on the store-carry-forward paradigm with random or controlled movement of mobile nodes. This research uses node mobility to enhance routing capability in a mobile network. A dual control planes model is presented, which includes the traditional S (stationary)-plane for routing among stationary nodes using connection-based message routing. In addition, a new control plane, M (mobile)-plane, is used for trajectory control of mobile nodes. The focus is on loosely controlled movement of mobile nodes to assist routing. The five goals of this work are the following: (1) Propose a generic framework for routing. (2) Offer flexible trajectory control of mobile nodes to balance several global objectives. (3) Explore the use of unicasting as a basic building block to support collective communication, including multicast, broadcast, anycast, gather, and gossip.

Proofs-of-work or \"client puzzles\" are a mechanism for protecting a number of protocols against DoS attacks. A puzzle is a cryptographically or combinatorially difficult problem that is generated by a server and must be solved by a client before it receives service. The difficulty of the puzzle is determined by the server as a function of previous client behavior, server load, etc. While puzzles have been used mostly at the application layer (and even there with only limited success), we argue that to prevent DoS attacks protection must exist in a layer common to all applications: the IP layer. Before this can be realized, there are a number of significant challenges that puzzle mechanisms must overcome, including efficiency, fairness, tamper-resistance, and control. More fundamentally, we believe that puzzles will not realize their full potential until there is a solid theoretical foundation for them. To date, one does not exist. <br\/><br\/>In this project we will address each of these challenges. First, we will give the puzzle problem a full provable-security treatment.

As part of this, we will formally analyze existing puzzle mechanisms based on previous work by us and others. In addition, we will explore new designs, with special attention given to puzzles constructed from T-functions, which show promise for being a basis for fast and effective puzzles. Our work will also address control-plane issues for intelligently setting puzzle difficulties.

For example, vascular systems deliver oxygen to every cell in the body, and as body size increases, network constraints limit the metabolic rate of individual cells. This is similar to wire scaling issues that arise with increasing chip sizes. The mathematical derivations are complicated, but they rely on a few basic assumptions: (1) Resources are distributed through internal space-filling (fractal) networks; (2) Terminal units in the network (e.g., capillaries) are of invariant size; (3) The design is optimized to maximize metabolic rate and minimize transport times. By combining these assumptions with fundamental physical constraints (e.g., organisms are 3-dimensional) and conservation laws (e.g., conservation of matter and energy), the exact scaling metabolic relations have been derived in biology.<br\/> <br\/>The project will apply concepts of metabolic scaling to three areas of information processing: i) the wiring of mammalian brains as reflected in the distribution of gray (neurons, the information processors) and white (axons, the information transmitting fibers) matter; ii) chip microarchitecture with regard to wire\/transistor scaling and power efficiency; and iii) traffic on the Internet as a function of the quantity of information being processed and the terminal units (access points) in the network. The research has three phases: i) Collect and evaluate existing scaling laws and empirical rules of thumb; ii) Derive these scaling relations from first principles; and iii) Develop analytical and computer simulation models that make quantitative, testable predictions. The three topics represent a logical progression of information processing systems, starting with the brain (based in biology with its three dimensions and electro\/physical transport systems), then moving to silicon-based chip design (still tied closely to physical processes, geometries, and conservation laws), and finally moving to the Internet (where geometry has a physical component but is less constrained and conservation laws are not well understood).","title":"BIC: Collaborative Research: CCF-EMT: A Biologically Motivated Scaling Theory for Computing","awardID":"0621941","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1705","name":"BIOLOGY & INFORMATION TECHNOLO"}}],"PIcoPI":["542053"],"PO":["565223"]},"116076":{"abstract":"Optimization of large scale eigenvalue computations is a long-standing<br\/>problem in computational mathematics and scientific computing community. <br\/>In this project, the PI and his collaborators will develop novel <br\/>structure-preserving algorithms for accurately and efficiently solving<br\/>large scale eigenvalue problems.

Transient communications and ad-hoc structures are precluded by default, and active association and re-association is generally slow and complicated while roaming. This is referred to as a transient network architecture. This project will develop the basic concepts for a heterogeneous network architecture based on persistently identified abstractions which map, at any point in time, to their current implementation, location, and other attributes required for network communication. Key concepts of the architecture will be prototyped and demonstrated. Each resource on the network is abstracted as a digital object and given unique identifiers within a distributed persistent identification system implemented using p2p technologies and as an evolution of the Handle System. These resources are then able to aggregate themselves into Areas of Influence which are network communities that define their own communication protocols, network implementation architecture, and implementation of the persistent identifier network. These areas route outgoing and incoming traffic based on persistent identifier resolution and local traffic based on their own local identification if necessary. This allows the overall architecture to maintain addressing and communications inter-connectivity while extensive implementation-level changes, are performed at the lower levels of the implementation. The architecture has a digital rights management (DRM) oriented design, and applies control theory to resource coordination. The work has the potential to define a future internet architecture.","title":"NeTS-NOSS: Collaborative Research: Future Internet Transient Network Design","awardID":"0626380","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["465604","351588","528342"],"PO":["434241"]},"109454":{"abstract":"The aim of this project is to develop new methods for interactively exploring relationships within large high-dimensional data sets, such as those typical of high-throughput scientific experiments.

Common to the various scenarios of hybrid networks are infrastructure nodes that act as relays for intra-network communications and as gateways for communications with external entities. Infrastructure nodes are typically connected to a powerful \"backbone\" with high capacity and low latency. Hybrid networks have been proposed in the literature for providing relief to the scalability problem of vanishing per node throughput in ad-hoc wireless networks. However, these studies have also shown that to restore scalable throughput, infrastructure nodes have to scale at the same rate as the user nodes, dooming this approach economically. When multiple users share the same link, wireless channels behave as \"leaky pipes\" interfering with each other. A totally new dimension is introduced by allowing nodes to cooperate. Cooperation among user or infrastructure nodes has the ability to convert \"leaky channels\" into high capacity multidimensional manifolds. A central question that CHARIoT seeks to answer is: Can cooperation among infrastructure nodes resolve the scalability problem of hybrid networks in the sense that in a cooperative regime, non-vanishing per node throughput is achievable even when the number of infrastructure nodes scales considerably slower than the number of user nodes? <br\/><br\/>Intellectual Impact: The proposed research seeks to answer pivotal fundamental and design questions on the role of hybrid networks and cooperative regimes as part of the next generation Internet.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: Advances in wireless technology and consumers demand for unfettered access usher in an era in which personal computing devices will become pervasive. This will lead to new communications paradigms that cannot be addressed by conventional network architectures. CHARIoT will have a broad impact on society by helping to determine whether wireless hybrid networks can play an important role in interconnecting pervasive devices and whether cooperative regimes can facilitate economically sensible designs of these networks. In addition to the impact on society, the extensive research provides an exciting platform for the educational goals of the academic institutions, including activities for both undergraduates and graduate students.","title":"Collaborative Research: NeTS-ProWiN: CHARIoT: A Cooperative, Hybrid wireless ARchitecture for the next generation InterneT","awardID":"0625637","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["560130"],"PO":["564777"]},"119266":{"abstract":"In today's Internet, a single service provider rarely has purview over an entire end-to-end path; this situation hinders the deployment and adoption of new network services. The PI propose to design and prototype a new network architecture, Cabo (Concurrent Architectures are Better than One), which resolves this problem by separating infrastructure providers (who own and manage the physical network infrastructure) from service providers (who deploy end-to-end services to users). Using Cabo, service providers will reserve network resources (i.e., virtual nodes and links) on equipment that may span one or more infrastructure providers. The separation of network service providers from infrastructure providers also allows a single service provider to construct end-to-end services; it also allows a service provider to operate multiple virtual networks, each of which is tailored to a specific application. For example, one virtual network may provide strict security guarantees but may not provide complete reachability to all destinations, while another virtual network may guarantee global reachability for applications that do not require strong security guarantees. The outcome of this project will be: (1) the design and implementation of a substrate that service providers can use to deploy new network architectures and services, and (2) investigation of example scenarios where Cabo can provide better security, robustness, and end-to-end performance guarantees. Cabo's initial design leverages virtualization, tunneling, and new experimental platforms for network protocols and architectures, including the PIs' own Virtual Network Infrastructure (VINI), which the PIs plan to use to prototype and evaluate their ideas.

The result of these deployments is an Internet composed of discrete subnetworks, attached at a relatively small number of choke points, lacking universal addressability, and including stateful in-network intermediaries as vital components.

In 25 years, the Internet has moved from an obscure research facility, to a critical piece of the national communication infrastructure. To appreciate the significance of this transformation, recall that a bug in the Internet' core routing algorithm inconvenienced several thousands in 1989 and the SQL slammer attack in 2003 grounded commercial airline flights, brought down thousands of ATM machines, and caused damages of approximately $1 billion dollars.

Software monocultures are widely used applications that share common vulnerabilities. Hence, any attack that exploits one instance of a vulnerable application provides the means for wide-spread damage. The emerging concept of collaborative security, wherein independent but cooperative entities form a group to improve their individual security, provides the opportunity to exploit the homogeneity of a software monoculture for collective and mutual protection. Monocultures can be leveraged to improve an application's overall security and reliability. COSS members running independent instances of the same application will continuously exchange information that allows them to collectively identify new application faults and attacks (collaborative monitoring), identify the core vulnerability shared by all instances of the application (vulnerability identification), and to automatically develop, test and apply fixes (heal the application). Identifying the application vulnerability requires potentially substantial costs in instrumentation and monitoring in each application instance.

Fundamental to this architecture is a transport layer service that operates in a hop-by-hop store-and-forward manner with large files. To realize this architecture, this project designs, implements and evaluates a new network architecture that incorporates the following elements: (1) reliable hop-by-hop transport of large files; (2) push-pull architecture for opportunistic delivery of files both to and from the wired network; (3) enhanced naming to provide location information for mobile terminals; and (4) distributed caching of popular content to make peer-to-peer file sharing a first-class service and to enable efficient reliable multicast. <br\/><br\/>The experimental evaluation phase of the project, based on extensive use of PlanetLab, the ORBIT radio grid testbed and real world environments supported by future experimental systems, examines network performance trade-offs for various potential protocol design choices and usage\/traffic scenarios.

But a good botnet model needs to track the dynamics of botnet online population in the long run.<br\/><br\/>This project has three main tasks. The first is to develop diurnal models to track the grow-and-decline trend of botnet on-line population using factors such as time zones and distribution of vulnerable systems. The second is to develop sampling and measurement approaches including capture-and-recapture and DNS cache snooping to estimate the total population of a botnet. The third is to develop measures for threat assessment, e.g., its aggregated bandwidth and resilience to response, based on the system, location and topology information of the bots.\"","title":"Collaborative Research: CT-ISG: Modeling and Measuring Botnets","awardID":"0627318","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7371","name":"CYBER TRUST"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[316655],"PO":["529429"]},"119289":{"abstract":"It is well documented how cooperative links can offer considerable performance gains at the physical layer, but it is unclear what kind of network support would be required to attain the sought gains.

They perform many important functions within the cells of each living being. These functions include signaling, metabolism, transport, and reproduction. A protein performs its function by interacting with other proteins or molecules inside the cell. Such an interaction may result in the binding of two molecules to form a complex, or in the separation of such a complex into its components. During the interactions among proteins, each molecule may have to change its three-dimensional shape in order to accommodate the binding with another molecule. This is possible because many proteins are inherently flexible. It is generally accepted that the three-dimensional shape of a protein and its ability to change its shape uniquely determine the protein's biological function.<br\/><br\/>An understanding of the biological function of proteins in the cell would allow a detailed understanding of the complex processes that happen inside a cell. Such an understanding would also facilitate the design of new drugs to influence these processes, should they be affected in the case of a disease.

The ability to accurately simulate interactions among flexible biomolecules therefore promises to facilitate scientific advances in computational drug design and represents an important computational tool to expand our understanding of cellular processes.

Moreover, unbalanced loads among multiple networks can incur congestion in a few WLANs while there are unused resources in others. The objective of this research is to manage shared system resources fairly among multiple WLANs to optimize the overall performance.

Transient communications and ad-hoc structures are precluded by default, and active association and re-association is generally slow and complicated while roaming. This is referred to as a transient network architecture. This project will develop the basic concepts for a heterogeneous network architecture based on persistently identified abstractions which map, at any point in time, to their current implementation, location, and other attributes required for network communication. Key concepts of the architecture will be prototyped and demonstrated. Each resource on the network is abstracted as a digital object and given unique identifiers within a distributed persistent identification system implemented using p2p technologies and as an evolution of the Handle System. These resources are then able to aggregate themselves into Areas of Influence which are network communities that define their own communication protocols, network implementation architecture, and implementation of the persistent identifier network. These areas route outgoing and incoming traffic based on persistent identifier resolution and local traffic based on their own local identification if necessary. This allows the overall architecture to maintain addressing and communications inter-connectivity while extensive implementation-level changes, are performed at the lower levels of the implementation. The architecture has a digital rights management (DRM) oriented design, and applies control theory to resource coordination. The work has the potential to define a future internet architecture.","title":"NeTS-NOSS: Collaborative Research: Transient Network Architecture","awardID":"0627067","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2008-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":[316488,316489],"PO":["565090"]},"118256":{"abstract":"This project plans to address several issues related to broadening the practicality of active storage such as:<br\/> the impact of mixed workloads (both active and normal requests) at the active devices; the impact of multiple active applications at the active devices; the resource scheduling and QOS policies for a diverse set of workloads; and, the impact of intelligent allocation in active storage systems.<br\/>In order to address these issues, the project plans to develop an \"active data\" model to allow flexible processing of data, either at devices or at the requester, develop QOS algorithms and security mechanisms for mixed workloads, and algorithms and prototypes for exploiting the nature of data to develop content-based active storage.","title":"HEC: Active Data Systems","awardID":"0621410","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2011-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7583","name":"ITR-HECURA"}}],"PIcoPI":["550709"],"PO":["565272"]},"118377":{"abstract":"Molecular computing seeks to advance new computing paradigms by exploring information processing mechanisms among nanoscale components.

Heterogeneous end-systems, novel communication abstractions, and security and manageability challenges require networks to provide a broad range of services that go beyond the simple store-and-forward capabilities of today's Internet. This project introduces new abstractions for information transfer and data services in the network to overcome the constraints of current network design. The explicit separation of communication and processing allows the composition of a variety of information transfer patterns that expand the capabilities of the network to meet its next-generation challenges. The goal is to develop communication abstractions based on the transfer of information rather than the process of sending data. Handling data representation, transfer, and storage of information is performed by services implemented on routers. The objectives and expected results of this project are: first, we develop and prototype suitable abstractions that meet the needs of next-generation network architectures; second, we explore how services can be specified by end-systems, mapped to resources inside the network, and controlled during their operation; third, we apply the proposed abstractions to explore novel networking paradigms that go beyond store-and-forward networking.

Familiar communication services, such as cell phones and Internet connections, fail in emergency situations when the need for them is at its peak. A robust network architecture must therefore focus on connectivity in the aftermath of disasters. Moreover, since disasters (hopefully) will not strike too often, an ideal solution should require little, if any, additional infrastructure investment. Rather, the solution should rely on organizing resources that are already available during a disaster to improve connectivity via clever design of communication protocols. This project investigates the requirements for post-disaster networking and communications, identifies the challenges and unique new opportunities, and develops a new network architecture and its companying protocol suite from the bottom up. The new service model and communication model are realized through novel communication protocols and architectural services, both tailored to the demands of post-disaster communications and very different from the existing Internet. <br\/><br\/>The broader impact of this project will be the complete design and thorough evaluation of the-day-after network architecture that is available for disaster relief, secure against malicious attackers, application-oriented, evolvable in both short-term and long-term, and manageable by authorized administrators.

WMNs have been posed as the competitive rival to the future wireless cellular technologies and provide a promising technology for ubiquitous high-speed network access, secure facility surveillance, disaster relief, public safety and homeland security. While many research efforts in WMNs have been made, security is still an untapped area. This project investigates this fundamental issue with the goal to develop a light-weight secure authentication and billing architecture, termed UPASS. UPASS features a novel user-broker-operator trust model built upon conventional certificate-based cryptography and emerging ID-based cryptography. Under this model, each user is furnished with a universal pass used to realize seamless roaming across WMN domains and gain ubiquitous secure network access. Moreover, an incontestable billing scheme is developed to facilitate the proper charging for the network usage through a lightweight real-time micropayment protocol built upon the combination of digital signature and one-way hash-chain techniques. Finally, since WMNs have been envisioned to be the most viable solutions to achieving seamless high-speed access with significantly low deployment cost, the proposed research will play a significant role in the commercialization of WMN technologies. Hence, it can have a significant impact on the telecommunications industries. The project benefits from the participation of minority faculty and students spanning undergraduate to doctoral levels across two institutions.","title":"NeTS-NBD: COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: UPASS-An Attack Resilient Security Architecture for Wireless Mesh Networks","awardID":"0626881","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7631","name":"ITR-NeTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["560200"],"PO":["557315"]},"118345":{"abstract":"We propose to implement a scheme for reconfigurable computing using metallic nanowire crossbar arrays, in which the active component at each cross point is based on an amorphous silicon (a-Si) - crystalline silicon (c-Si) heterostructure.<br\/><br\/>As the device integration level reaches the projected terasbit scale (1012 devices\/cm2), novel, radical changes in device structures and architectures will be needed to facilitate the escalating demands of defect tolerance and massive interconnects associated with nanoscale devices. Reconfigurable architectures, in particular, crossbar structures in which the active components are hysteretic resistors formed at the points where two nanowire arrays crossing each other, have emerged as a leading candidate. The crossbar scheme offers inherent defect tolerant capability, as the circuit can be easily rerouted around defect components. The simple two-terminal active device structure makes it suitable for aggressive scaling, with the potential that both logic and memory functions can be integrated in the same entity. In a typical crossbar structure, arrays of metallic nanowires are used as both the interconnects and the contact leads, and self-assembled molecules are proposed as the active, hysteretic component. However, switches based on molecules suffer from serious issues such as low yield, slow switching speed and low on\/off ratio, which greatly affect their application potential.<br\/><br\/>In this proposal, we present an alternative, solid-state based system that precisely addresses these issues, by utilizing an a-Si\/c-Si heterostructure as the active component in a metallic nanowire crossbar array. Compared to molecule based devices, the Si heterostructure devices offer comparable scalability down to nanometer scale, while exhibiting nearly ideal properties for hysteretic switching, such as high yield, fast switching speed, well-defined thresholds and high on\/off ratio. Furthermore, intrinsic rectifying behavior, a property that eliminates crosstalk and is highly desirable in the crossbar scheme, can be achieved in our device structure through proper material engineering. The proposed Si heterostructure crossbar arrays will offer up to terabit-scale density in a defect tolerant, reconfigurable architecture, while being fabricated on a reliable platform that is also compatible with available Si technology.

Current challenges in managing and trouble-shooting Internet-scale routing systems demonstrate that manageability cannot be an \"after-thought\" second to other design criteria. This project addresses fundamental questions on building manageability into routing systems for future Internet architectures. <br\/><br\/>The approach taken in the project is two-fold: i) develop a framework for specifying, understanding, and evaluating what features should\/could be \"designed-in\" into routing systems in support of manageability; and ii) evaluate design choices and trade-offs thereof in terms of performance and manageability. The framework is based on experiences derived from case studies of existing routing systems and new network architectures. It specifies core tenets for manageability of routing systems, and lays out a \"strawman\" for building manageable routing systems. This framework is then applied to designing and analyzing routing systems from a manageability standpoint. <br\/><br\/>A sound design process for managing routing systems is vital to future Internet development. A more manageable routing infrastructure will not only help lower the cost of network operations and management, but also reduce service disruptions that could adversely affect society at large. <br\/><br\/>The project will deliver results identifying key manageability features that must be incorporated into future routing architectures, and demonstrate their benefits through development and evaluation of actual systems. Project outcomes will be disseminated through research publications, software prototypes and PIs' active participation in the community efforts towards development of GENI and future Internet architectures.","title":"Collaborative Research: NeTS-FIND: A Framework for Manageability in Future Routing Systems","awardID":"0627004","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7631","name":"ITR-NeTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["564485"],"PO":["565090"]},"119456":{"abstract":"Tamper-proof coprocessors for secure computing are poised to become a<br\/>standard hardware feature on future computers.

Tools and middleware are investigated for sensor network design, implementation, execution, and post-deployment troubleshooting and maintenance. The project addresses key weaknesses in the current state-of-the-art. Recent advances in hardware and wireless communication made cost-effective development of wireless sensor nodes feasible. However, they have not lead to a proliferation of sensor network deployments. The problem lies largely in the high cost of sensor network embedded software development. Challenges that plague the current development efforts include (i) lack of a network architecture that separates application-level and network-level concerns, (ii) poor composability of independently written middleware, (iii) insufficient tools for distributed debugging and testing, (iv) poor system calibration and maintenance support, and (v) poor support for performance assurances. <br\/><br\/>Myriads of fundamental research problems arise in addressing the above challenges. New computing paradigms are needed that are suitable for sensor networks. Operating system support is needed that exports convenient system abstractions yet fits efficiently on motes. Debugging tools must be developed that can reason about distributed execution correctness in an unreliable, resource-limited environment. Network transport must be designed that is suitable for a large category of sensor network applications. The project addresses the aforementioned problems in the context of building a comprehensive software development toolset. Outreach and educational activities are included.

The methodology, or set of best practices, addresses such issues as: how values can be consistently and systematically integrated into the design of software systems, how values investigations, in the context of technical design, can be made scientifically rigorous, and, the construction of a viable set of general software design principles that could lead to the integration of values across a variety of design tasks. The VAP project integrates the humanities, the arts, and social, and ethical interests into the scientific design of technological systems by specifically focusing on values in the design of games. The project involves three research activities including: 1. Development of a rigorous methodology (or, best practices) for supporting value conscious design; a handbook of the Values at Play methodology is made available in hardcopy and on the Web. This phase explores such issues as: how to identify values that might be relevant to a given design project, how to embody or express values in system design, how to engage in appraisal of whether and to what extent designers have successfully embedded target values in a given system. 2. Development of a values-in-design toolkit which includes: a) game building components to help students create games based on a values-orientation; and b) several working examples demonstrating values-to-design-feature correlations. 3. Assessment of design training interventions: the team will design several instruments to assess the values integration in the methodology and Toolkit. In addition to the research activities, this project engages faculty and practitioners in a Workshop about Values at Play. Embedding values within technological systems, and verifying that such systems actually reflects those values, is particularly appropriate using computer games since they affect larger society. This research will also be of use to educators and systems designers in the IT field considering game structures in their approaches as well as to scholars interested in the study of technology, society, and humanity. Potentially, this project might advance this line of inquiry to a pervasive, industry changing, international level of importance which not only promotes the humanistic study of these issues but enhances real products for real people.<br\/><br\/>Program Manager: Anita J.

Using comprehensibility as a criterion for evaluating designs poses a major intellectual challenge because comprehensibility is a subjective notion that complicates the task of detecting it automatically. The proposers' approach toward detecting comprehensibility is to modify two program analysis tools (Daikon and AbsInt) so that those tools can be used to comprehend \"good\" designs. The project has two main research goals: a) Determine if comprehensibility captures the informal notion of \"good\" design. This goal represents the empirical validation (or refutation) of the main thesis, that comprehensibility is the key quality shared by good designs; and, b) Identify design features that make designs more comprehensible. The intent here is to analyze different programs that are freely accessible on the Internet to identify designs that are easily comprehended by the tools, and then to see what design features they have in common. This is a highly speculative goal, but it is the main scientific question raised by the research. Moreover, it is one that can have a broad impact on the practice of programming. The thesis of this project, that comprehensibility can be used as a single criterion for evaluating design quality and that this criterion can be measured objectively by using automated tools that infer meaning from programs, provides a single and testable criterion to measure quality. This research brings the art of software design one step closer to a scientific footing. An early benefit of this project will be the identification of design features that lead to greater comprehensibility, hence to better design quality. Moreover, the integration of automated tools to measure design quality objectively is an aspect of this proposal that is unique and innovative. If successful, the project may contribute to the body of knowledge of the science of design by presenting \"good\" design precepts for practitioners to follow. In addition, the proposed research has the potential to make a significant impact both on computer science education and on the practice of programming in general. If this project is successful in establishing that comprehensibility is an adequate measure of design quality, students and professional designers will have a new and objective way to judge different designs. <br\/><br\/>Program Manager: Anita J.

Until recently, when scientists wanted to \"listen in\" on these signals, all they could do was to monitor one cable or cell at a time, getting only a very limited view of the messages being passed through the visual system. In particular, this left us literally and figuratively blind to the possibility that combinations of pulses from neighboring cells could have special meaning. The emergence of experimental techniques for recording the signals from many cells simultaneously, under reasonably natural stimulus conditions, thus offers an unprecedented opportunity to explore the full complexity of the raw data that the brain has to work with as it tries to understand what we see. Indeed, the most recent generation of multi-electrode array technologies achieves a sampling efficiency that should allow recording from nearly all of the cells in a small patch of the retina, providing access to all of the signals that the brain can use in making sense out of the corresponding small patch of the visual world. The goals of this project are to develop in tandem the experimental methods to realize this promise and the theoretical framework for understanding the problem that the brain has to solve in dealing with these data. <br\/><br\/>Even a relatively small group of twenty cells in the eye can send millions of possible signals to the brain. Just as not all combinations of twenty letters constitute real words or phrases in English, we expect that not all combinations of pulses from nearby cells actually are used. Building on preliminary results, we will develop the mathematical tools required to describe the analog of spelling rules for these neural words. What we intuitively think of as a surprising event presumably is represented by a rare word, and we will push our understanding of the relative frequencies with which the different words are used so that we can identify reliably the signals that the brain must recognize as surprising. In a similar direction we will examine how one word predicts the next, and how the brain could effectively separate the predictable from the surprising. We will compare these theoretical descriptions with what is known about brain's mechanisms for detecting such events. Improving our instruments in parallel with these mathematical developments will allow us to deal not just with twenty cells but with roughly two hundred, where the number of possibilities truly becomes astronomical. <br\/><br\/>Historically, studies of the retina have provided the conceptual foundations for work on many different areas of the brain, and we thus expect that the results of this project will help understand not just the language that the eye uses in describing the world but also provide a general set of tools for exploring the way in which many cells cooperate to shape our perceptions and thoughts.","title":"Combinatorial and collective coding in the retina","awardID":"0613435","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2011-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7327","name":"CRCNS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7602","name":"INFORMATION INTEGRATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["543673","398611"],"PO":["564318"]},"119402":{"abstract":"This NSF Cyber Trust project investigates techniques to achieve high assurance that systems satisfy information flow policies like confidentiality and integrity.

This is accomplished by designating certain procedures or subprograms as exempt from the baseline policy and instead subject to a specification in program logic (called ``flowspecs'') that expresses information downgrading. To check conformance with baseline policy, type checking is used. To check conformance with flowspecs, formal verification tools are used.

Examples include data about students and the classes they took where the links are the association between a student and the classes she took; data about network packets and the routers that forwarded these packets, where the links are the association of packets to routers; or data about people and their social network, where the links are the social relationships between people. It is the explicit representation of these links in the data that violates some of the key assumptions of prior work. This research spans the whole spectrum from motivating applications of linked data, to novel privacy models and practical anonymization algorithms, to new techniques for attacking and analyzing anonymized data.","title":"CT-T: Collaborative Research: Preserving Utility while Ensuring Privacy for Linked Data","awardID":"0627642","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2011-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7371","name":"CYBER TRUST"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7456","name":"ITR-CYBERTRUST"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["449017","545655"],"PO":["543481"]},"119215":{"abstract":"Conventional parallelization strategies do not scale<br\/>well when the computational effort arises from the<br\/>need to simulate to long time spans, rather than from<br\/>large state space.

It primarily focuses on sparse principal component analysis (PCA) and the related sparse canonical correlation analysis (CCA), but also intends to explore sparse variants of methods such as correspondence analysis and discriminant analysis. The motivation for developing sparse multivariate analysis algorithms is their potential for yielding statistical results that are more interpretable and more robust than classical analyses, while giving up as little as possible in the way of statistical efficiency and expressive power. The investigators have derived a convex relaxation for sparse PCA as a large-scale semidefinite program. The proposed research first studies the theoretical and practical performance of this relaxation as well as the computational complexity involved in solving large-scale instances of the corresponding semidefinite programs. In a next step, it focuses on extending these results to the other multivariate data analysis methods cited above. <br\/><br\/>Principal Component Analysis (or PCA) is a classic statistical tool used to study experimental data with a very large number of variables (meteorological records, gene expression coefficients, the interest rate curve, social networks, etc). It is primarily used as a dimensionality reduction tool: PCA produces a reduced set of synthetic variables that captures a maximum amount of information on the data. This makes it possible to represent data sets with thousands of variables on a three dimensional graph while still capturing most of the features of the original data, thus making visualization and interpretation easier. Unfortunately, the key shortcoming of PCA is that these new synthetic variables are a weighted sum of all the original variables making their physical interpretation difficult. The proposed research will study algorithms for computing sparse PCA, i.e., computing new synthetic variables that are the weighted sum of only a few problem variables while keeping most of the features of the original data set. Sparse PCA is a hard combinatorial problem but the investigators have produced a relaxation that can be solved efficiently using recent results in convex optimization. The investigators plan to study the theoretical and practical performance of this relaxation and extend these results to other statistical methods.","title":"Collaborative Research, MSPA-MCS: Sparse Multivariate Data Analysis","awardID":"0625352","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0304","name":"Division of MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES","abbr":"DMS"},"pgm":{"id":"7454","name":"MSPA-INTERDISCIPLINARY"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2878","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CCF"}}],"PIcoPI":["440969"],"PO":["565309"]},"119347":{"abstract":"This project is designed to investigate new dynamically switched optical networking architectures using dynamic optical network technologies that leverage photonic integrated circuits (PICs).

SNI is general and easy to deploy: the effective abstraction for a wide range of complex tasks enables the rapid deployment of novel sensornets applications. Furthermore, our approach is resource aware, efficient and adaptive: nodes have limited computational, communication and power resources, thus SNI automatically optimizes its communication pattern to reduce resource usage; this optimization is data driven, since the complexity of the high-level task is greatly dependent on the current state of the monitored phenomena. Robustness to node and communication failures is a fundamental element of SNI: Low-cost sensornets are prone to lossy communication, sensor and node failures; our architecture seeks to provide both theoretical and empirical robustness guarantees.

WMNs have been posed as the competitive rival to the future wireless cellular technologies and provide a promising technology for ubiquitous high-speed network access, secure facility surveillance, disaster relief, public safety and homeland security. While many research efforts in WMNs have been made, security is still an untapped area. This project investigates this fundamental issue with the goal to develop a light-weight secure authentication and billing architecture, termed UPASS. UPASS features a novel user-broker-operator trust model built upon conventional certificate-based cryptography and emerging ID-based cryptography. Under this model, each user is furnished with a universal pass used to realize seamless roaming across WMN domains and gain ubiquitous secure network access. Moreover, an incontestable billing scheme is developed to facilitate the proper charging for the network usage through a lightweight real-time micropayment protocol built upon the combination of digital signature and one-way hash-chain techniques. Finally, since WMNs have been envisioned to be the most viable solutions to achieving seamless high-speed access with significantly low deployment cost, the proposed research will play a significant role in the commercialization of WMN technologies. Hence, it can have a significant impact on the telecommunications industries.

They may perform anomalously due to various implementation problems, which cause performance degradation, and more importantly compromise the predictability of system performance behaviors. This project investigates a new approach to comprehensively examine the large space of possible runtime settings (including workload properties and system configurations) and to characterize performance anomalies in system software like operating systems. This approach relies on the knowledge of high-level system design algorithms\/protocols and employs a system performance prediction model using such knowledge. Aided by the model, the approach acquires a representative set of anomalous workload and system configuration settings by comparing measured system performance with model prediction at some sample settings. Anomalous settings are then statistically clustered into groups likely attributed to individual ``causes''. Finally, each such cause (or performance bug) is characterized with correlated system configurations and workload properties. The research contribution of this project is the proposal of a systematic approach for comprehensively characterizing performance anomalies in complex system software. Such anomaly characterization can aid performance debugging and guide the avoidance of anomaly-inducing runtime settings. Broader impacts of the project include the dissemination of research results and developed software artifacts.

PCE first randomizes the memory image of an application, increasing the odds that errors will have no effect, and guaranteeing that any bug will only affect a small percentage of users.

Main components of our automata will be: (1) recognition regions based on antibodies or their fragment or aptamers that will target characteristic cell-surface makers; (2) oligonucleotides used to establish communications between recognition regions; and (3) drug delivery components that will trigger release of drugs upon cross-linking of antibodies. As our three aims, we will test over the next three years mixtures implementing three different programs (or Boolean logic operations) on cells:<br\/>1. {M1ANDM2 Apoptosis}; a three-components automaton, the action of which will result in crosslinking of antibodies and significant increase in apoptosis only in cells that display both cell-surface makers used to target B-cell lymphoma lines.<br\/>2. {M1ANDM2 Drug Release}; another three-component automaton, similar to the one above, except it will also trigger the release of a small cytotoxic molecule.<br\/>3. {M3ANDNOTM1 Drug Release}, a three component automaton, which will take into account a protective factor.<br\/>Intellectual merit<br\/>Molecular automata are networks of molecules that change states according to the presence or absence of inputs they recognize and an algorithm they implement.

All therapies that are based on a targeted elimination of a subpopulation of cells (e.g. cancer, autoimmune diseases) will benefit from the ability of to take into account more than one cell-surface marker, because very few cell surface markers are limited to only one cell type.<br\/>Educational Significance. Education-wise, we have a very productive program to integrate local high schools students into our group. One student from this program has been recently a first author on a publication describing molecular full adder, and several more students will be coauthors on a manuscript that we are preparing on complex automata. In this project we plan to involve one summer student during first year in the isolation of aptamer against one cell-surface marker. The second student will optimize in vitro the structure switching process needed for a NOT gate operation during the second year of this program.

This architectural study is intended to lead to the design of control\/management and data interfaces between cognitive radio nodes in a local network, and also between cognitive radio subnetworks and the global Internet. The second thrust is to apply these architectural and protocol design results to prototype an open-source cognitive radio protocol (the CogNet stack) and use it for experimental evaluations on emerging cognitive radio platforms. A number of architectural issues are examined as we try to identify an efficient and complete solution these include control and management protocols, support for collaborative PHY, dynamic spectrum coordination, flexible MAC layer protocols, ad hoc group formation and cross-layer adaptation.<br\/>The experimental component of this project aims to prototype an open-source Linux-based CogNet software protocol stack for use with emerging cognitive radio platforms (such as the GNU\/USRP2 radio to be used as the baseline, the KU agile radio or the Lucent\/WINLAB network-centric prototype), and make this software available for community research. The prototype software is validated in two steps: first in a wireless local-area radio network scenario with moderate numbers of cognitive radio nodes, and later as part of several end-to-end experiments using a wide-area network testbed such as PlanetLab (and GENI in the future).","title":"Collaborative Research: NeTS-FIND: CogNet - An Experimental Protocol Stack for Cognitive Radio Networks and Its Integration with the Future Internet","awardID":"0626827","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7631","name":"ITR-NeTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["458795","463128"],"PO":["564777"]},"119315":{"abstract":"This project aims to develop a clean-slate Internet architecture where protection from malicious network-based attacks is a fundamental design goal. This goal is to be achieved by requiring all traffic to explicitly signal its origin as well as intent to the network at the very outset. <br\/><br\/>Using this as a guiding principle, the principal investigators plan to develop tailor-made security architectures for private networks (e.g., enterprises) which often enforce tight controls on who can communicate with whom, as well as for public servers (e.g., e-commerce sites) which are more \"open\" and desire to be globally visible. The proposed solution for private networks requires all network-wide policies to be specified at a single location called the domain controller.

This novel approach will bridge existing disjoint optimization efforts at each individual layer and responds to the critical call of improving the overall I\/O system performance with increasingly deep HEC I\/O stacks.","title":"Collaborative Research: Application-adaptive I\/O Stack for Data-intensive Scientific Computing","awardID":"0621427","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2009-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7583","name":"ITR-HECURA"}}],"PIcoPI":["542015"],"PO":["565272"]},"119359":{"abstract":"One of the primary limiting factors to improving the security, robustness, and performance of the global computation and communication infrastructure is the difficulty of subjecting novel protocols, applications, and services to realistic network conditions, at scale.

With the goal of strengthening the security of the infrastructure at all levels, the workshop seeks to determine what questions have to be answered for short and long-term strategies to be successful. Looking at both technical and policy issues and the interaction between the two, the work addresses fundamental questions of infrastructure protection. <br\/><br\/>Computer security has three main thrusts: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). Security of Infrastructure involves the dynamic interaction of many components and at different levels: Authentication, Authorization, Access control, Auditing, and Assurance (AAAAA). Many questions illustrating the need for security in the infrastructure remain open. Hence, highlights include: <br\/>* How security in the infrastructure should be defined and measured <br\/>* How security policies should be defined, whose security policies should apply to various infrastructure components, and how policies should be reconciled when necessary <br\/>* How trust should be assigned to messages that control routing throughout the network, etc. <br\/>Additionally, the workshop may also look into: <br\/>* The role that academic infrastructure can play in providing a secure infrastructure, <br\/>* Partnerships between agencies and managers of infrastructure systems that may facilitate the creation of a secure world-wide infrastructure, and <br\/>* Partnerships required ensuring that the technological and computer and information science research challenges can be met. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: Since the infrastructure of the Internet, albeit fragile, underlies the fabric of most people's lives, economy of many organizations, companies, and nations, the workshop expects to present a set of strategies for strengthening security of infrastructure and a set of questions to guide their implementation.

Two common approaches to ensure reliable system behavior are: 1) Scientific foundations, tools, and architectural principles for ensuring elimination of errors, and 2) foundations, tools, and architectural principles for ensuring tolerance to such errors. While the first solution is sufficient, building completely error-free large-scale systems has been an elusive exercise as evidenced by experiences with today's engineering artifacts (e.g., recalls on vehicles, cascading power blackouts, etc).

The importance of computational solution to protein structures is increasing owing to the rapid growth in the number of sequenced genomes, and the relatively slow growth rate in the number of experimentally determined protein structures. Here we propose to develop a new paradigm for threading-based protein structure prediction using side-chain information. While residue-based approaches have made threading computationally feasible to predict protein structures in the past decade, we clearly see an urgent need now for more accurate prediction techniques that can provide structural data at higher resolution, to meet the rapidly growing need of structural and functional genomics studies. To address this challenging issue, we will develop a novel computational framework for solving a generalized threading problem, in which backbone threading and side-chain packing are predicted simultaneously. Specifically, we will (a) develop a new energy function that combines residue-level information for backbone threading and atom-level information for side-chain packing; (b) develop a novel algorithmic framework for solving the generalized threading problem; (c) extend this algorithmic framework to deal with more general threading problems such as constrained threading problems; (d) test and evaluate the new threading energy functions and algorithms to demonstrate the feasibility and the power of using side-chain information in protein structure prediction, and (e) develop a freely accessible web-based prediction server to benefit the entire research community. <br\/> <br\/> To the best of our knowledge, this project probably represents the first systematic effort in generalizing the current threading paradigm to include the detailed side-chain information during the threading process. While the side-chain information should help to significantly improve the prediction accuracy and resolution of protein structures, the generalized threading problem raises some very challenging computational problems. We expect that this new threading capability, when fully developed and implemented, will significantly improve the state of the art of protein structure prediction. In addition, the new threading energy functions and the algorithmic techniques developed in this project will prove to be useful to other researchers in their own development of protein structure prediction capabilities. <br\/><br\/> We believe that our new threading framework will lead the way in developing a new generation of prediction techniques for protein structures, which will not only provide much more accurate backbone structures compared to the existing threading methods but also provide a big portion of the missing structural information by the current threading techniques, i.e., the side-chains.

These attacks could involve eavesdropping, message tampering, or identity spoofing, that have been addressed by customized cryptographic primitives for encryption and authentication. Alternately, the attacks may be targeted to the control or the data traffic in wireless networks. Since the networks are resource constrained (bandwidth, energy, or processing), providing detection and countermeasures to such attacks often turn out to be more challenging than in wired networks. The project is developing protocols for detecting, diagnosing, and mitigating one class of attacks, namely, those that affect the control traffic. Typical examples of control traffic are routing, monitoring the liveness of nodes, and system management. It is critical to guarantee the fidelity of control traffic since disrupting it can hamper the data traffic. For example, if a malicious node manages to interpose itself in an established route between two legitimate nodes, it can disrupt the data traffic by selectively dropping the data packets. Such attacks are often difficult to detect and can be launched without the need for cryptographic keys. The research presents a technique called local monitoring whereby nodes oversee part of the traffic going in and out of its neighbor nodes. The project makes neighbor monitoring feasible in resource constrained environments and mitigates the effect of the malicious node through isolation, either locally or globally using a distributed protocol. The work will enable the deployment of MAHAS networks for critical secure applications. We expect application of the results to two testbeds for environment monitoring (water quality and pharmaceutical manufacturing) that we are currently building.","title":"NeTS-NOSS: Robust Sensor Network Architecture through Neighborhood Monitoring and Isolation","awardID":"0626830","effectiveDate":"2006-09-15","expirationDate":"2011-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["548182","556632"],"PO":["557315"]},"119426":{"abstract":"This project involves the development of cryptographic protocols and techniques to enhance the security and privacy of the collection, storage, and processing of online survey data.

The PI propose to design and prototype a new network architecture, Cabo (Concurrent Architectures are Better than One), which resolves this problem by separating infrastructure providers (who own and manage the physical network infrastructure) from service providers (who deploy end-to-end services to users). Using Cabo, service providers will reserve network resources (i.e., virtual nodes and links) on equipment that may span one or more infrastructure providers. The separation of network service providers from infrastructure providers also allows a single service provider to construct end-to-end services; it also allows a service provider to operate multiple virtual networks, each of which is tailored to a specific application. For example, one virtual network may provide strict security guarantees but may not provide complete reachability to all destinations, while another virtual network may guarantee global reachability for applications that do not require strong security guarantees. The outcome of this project will be: (1) the design and implementation of a substrate that service providers can use to deploy new network architectures and services, and (2) investigation of example scenarios where Cabo can provide better security, robustness, and end-to-end performance guarantees. Cabo's initial design leverages virtualization, tunneling, and new experimental platforms for network protocols and architectures, including the PIs' own Virtual Network Infrastructure (VINI), which the PIs plan to use to prototype and evaluate their ideas.

This situation has spurred much interest in efficient runtime monitoring of software systems' dynamic behavior in production environments. Most existing runtime monitoring approaches, however, suffer from three limitations: they are ad-hoc and hard to extend\/adapt; they impose too much overhead to be practical; and they are defined within only one computational layer (hardware, O\/S, VM, or software). This project will investigate and define a general, efficient runtime monitoring approach that leverages software and hardware capabilities in a synergistic way. In this approach, monitoring tasks will be specified using a language that provides suitable abstractions. These specifications will then be automatically analyzed and the monitoring tasks distributed across software and hardware layers to minimize performance overhead. This project will improve the state of the art by (1) providing hardware and software support for new monitoring activities currently neglected as impractical, (2) developing infrastructure and tools that will be made available to the research community, and (3) improving overall software quality through detection of and reaction to anomalous, erratic, or malicious software behavior.","title":"Collaborative research: Software and Hardware Support for Efficient Monitoring of Program Behavior","awardID":"0541108","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2010-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["485790"],"PO":["564388"]},"135486":{"abstract":"A highly publicized report by the American Cancer Society noted that cancer has<br\/>surpassed heart disease to become the number one killer of adults under the age of 85<br\/>in the United States today. At the top of the list was lung cancer, a disease that is<br\/>eminently preventable. Addressing public health threats like cancer are acute,<br\/>system-wide challenges that would benefit from network-centric approaches. For<br\/>example, when the tobacco research community realized it had taken over a decade to<br\/>discover that they had already collected substantial empirical evidence, distributed<br\/>across its network of tobacco researchers, indicating that 'light' (low-tar\/low-nicotine<br\/>brands) cigarettes reduced neither exposure to nor risk of cancer, researchers began to<br\/>understand the importance of effectively sharing resources and information across the<br\/>entire community. In response, government agencies involved in public health have<br\/>made a substantial foundational investment in developing a digital government<br\/>cyberinfrastructure--Tobacco Systems integration Grid (TobacSIG)--to enable<br\/>collaboration within the Tobacco Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Evaluation Network<br\/>(TSEEN). While such an underlying cyberinfrastructure is a prerequisite, delays in<br\/>discoveries (such as the carcinogenic effects of 'light' cigarette mentioned above) have<br\/>prompted the TSEEN community to underscore the need for social network referral<br\/>tools as a crucial component of any effort to enhance the efficacy of their collaboration<br\/>system.<br\/>This project will develop, deploy and assess social networking tools to enhance<br\/>collaboration among members of TSEEN using the TobacSIG cyberinfrastructure. The<br\/>proposed project brings together researchers in information science, social science, and<br\/>public health who have established strong collaborations with government partners on<br\/>the development of networks to support transdisciplinary research in public health. The<br\/>researchers have assisted the government partners in formulating the challenges and<br\/>envisioning solutions; hence the research team is will positioned to leverage the<br\/>substantial financial and human resources being invested by NIH National Cancer<br\/>Institute and its partner government agencies in the TobacSIG cyberinfrastructure.<br\/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed project is a pioneering effort at incorporating social<br\/>network referral tools as an integral part of collaborative systems within the context of<br\/>digital government. First, the proposed project will extend theoretical understanding of<br\/>the emergence of collaboration network structures involving multidimensional networks,<br\/>where nodes may be individuals, documents, data sets, services (such as<br\/>visual-analytic tools), or keywords\/concepts. Second, it will pioneer theory development<br\/>and testing about the influence of network referral systems on collaboration outcomes.<br\/>Specifically, the proposed project will assess the extent to which collaboration outcomes<br\/>are influenced by (i) different theoretically-derived structures of network referrals, (ii)<br\/>different incentive structures provided to users of the network referral system, (iii)<br\/>different types of network data used to generate referrals, and (iv) different information<br\/>visualizations used to represent network referrals. Third, the research will extend the<br\/>exponential random graph modeling techniques that have been largely used to estimate<br\/>structural dependencies in relatively small (typically no larger than 500)<br\/>one-dimensional networks. The proposed project will extend these techniques to<br\/>multidimensional networks containing over 10,000 nodes.<br\/>Broader Impacts: As cyberinfrastructure is deployed to support collaboration among<br\/>large communities in government and elsewhere, it is increasingly obvious that social<br\/>network tools have immense potential. In this project the researchers will seek to<br\/>respond to the refrain 'if only the Tobacco Surveillance Epidemiology Evaluation<br\/>Network knew what it knew.' Generalizing the relevance of this same refrain to a wide<br\/>spectrum of other contexts is suggestive of the broader impacts of the proposed<br\/>research.

A declarative teleological model of a physical device that explicitly captures the teleological relationships among the structure, behaviors and functions of its design enables localization of the modifications to the structure to achieve new functions. The ontology of teleological models provides a vocabulary for classifying, representing, indexing and accessing specific design cases, generic adaptation plans, primitive design components, and abstract design patterns. In analogy to physical devices, the PI views software artifacts as abstract devices, i.e., as abstract teleological artifacts with structures and behaviors that result in the accomplishment of desired functions. A further analogy to adaptive physical design leads to the hypothesis that teleology is a fundamental organizational principle of adaptive software design. Of course, software artifacts are also quite different from physical devices because the notions of structure, behavior, function, and teleology in the two domains are different. Thus, this project will address the following six questions: What are productive notions of structure, behavior, function, and teleology in software design? How might a declarative teleological model of a software artifact specify its functional architecture? How might teleological analysis enable localization of the modifications needed to the architecture of a software artifact to achieve new functions? How might the ontology of the teleological models of software artifacts support classification, representation, indexing and retrieval of generic adaptation plans, primitive software components, and abstract design patterns? What might be a teleology-driven process of adaptive software design? And how might these building blocks be used to support interactive software design more easily, efficiently and effectively than at present? To answer these questions, the PI will develop building blocks of teleological reasoning in adaptive software design in the form of knowledge representations, taxonomies, libraries, methods, and processes. To these ends, the PI has adopted a three-pronged approach. He will conduct detailed empirical case studies of the evolutionary histories of designs of game-playing software agents for interactive strategy games such as Freeciv and C-evo. He will develop an interactive software design environment and, for a small class of changes in the functional requirements of game-playing agents, automate the design adaptations, which will help insure that all the building blocks work well together. And he will use the interactive environment in undergraduate software engineering courses to support design adaptations for a large class of changes in the functional requirements of game-playing agents, and conduct formal experiments using control groups to evaluate the efficacy of teleological reasoning in support of adaptive software design.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Computational artifacts, including software artifacts, are increasingly pervasive and ubiquitous. A major factor in the cost of software development is maintaining the software artifact as its design requirements evolve; even a small reduction in this cost may have a significant impact on software practice. Since this research will address the issue of software design adaptations in response to changes in functional design requirements, its potential applications are wide-ranging and open-ended, the design and development of game-playing software agents being just one example. Because the new tools developed in this project for interactive software design weill be introduced into the classroom, they will have a direct impact on the educational technology used in the computing sciences. Knowledge acquired from the project will be disseminated in conferences and journals in software engineering, design cognition and computing, AI, and game playing.","title":"SoD-TEAM: Teleological Reasoning in Adaptive Software Design","awardID":"0613744","effectiveDate":"2006-09-01","expirationDate":"2012-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7372","name":"ITR-SCIENCE OF DESIGN"}}],"PIcoPI":["539354","397849"],"PO":["565227"]},"116654":{"abstract":"Title: \"Collaborative Research: SoD-TEAM: A Feedback-Based Architecture for Highly Reliable Embedded Software\"<br\/><br\/>The focus of this project is on developing a theory and architectural framework for incorporating feedback control as a main principle of software engineering.

Two common approaches to ensure reliable system behavior are: 1) Scientific foundations, tools, and architectural principles for ensuring elimination of errors, and 2) foundations, tools, and architectural principles for ensuring tolerance to such errors. While the first solution is sufficient, building completely error-free large-scale systems has been an elusive exercise as evidenced by experiences with today's engineering artifacts (e.g., recalls on vehicles, cascading power blackouts, etc). Consequently, a new approach to robust software design, development and certification is needed that addresses the increasing cost and safety implications of the current practices.
