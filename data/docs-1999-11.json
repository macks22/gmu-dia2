They will investigate the emergence of biocomplexity and examine its consequences for the performance of living organisms and ecological communities. Parallel experiments will be performed with two very different systems, in order to study general principles. One system employs bacteria, and the other system is digital. The latter consists of special computer programs that self-replicate, mutate, and evolve novel sequences of instructions to solve problems. One set of experiments will monitor the evolution of ecosystem complexity, in which a single progenitor diverges into multiple types that perform distinct functions by exploiting different resources. Follow-up experiments will examine the effects of removing member species on the remainder of the community. Another project will develop the software used for studying digital organisms into an educational tool.<br\/>This project, which is being supported by the Directorates for Biological Sciences, Computer Information Science and Engineering, Engineering, and by the division of Mathematical Sciences and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, will impact several scientific fields, and the findings may provide basic information useful for both environmental and biotechnological applications. For example, ecologists may find principles useful for improving the performance of beneficial organisms in the environment. Computer scientists may discover computational strategies, evolved by real organisms that can be employed in developing more complex software.","title":"BIOCOMPLEXITY: Bacterial and Computational Experiments to Identify General Principles that Govern the Evolution of Complexity","awardID":"9981397","effectiveDate":"1999-11-01","expirationDate":"2005-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0309","name":"Division of CHEMISTRY","abbr":"CHE"},"pgm":{"id":"1253","name":"OFFICE OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY AC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0709","name":"Division of BIOENGINEERING & ENVIRON SYSTE","abbr":"BES"},"pgm":{"id":"1179","name":"Enviro Health & Safety of Nano"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0709","name":"Division of BIOENGINEERING & ENVIRON SYSTE","abbr":"BES"},"pgm":{"id":"1402","name":"BIOCHEMICAL & BIOMASS ENG"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0801","name":"Division of ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY","abbr":"DEB"},"pgm":{"id":"1174","name":"POPULATION DYNAMICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0801","name":"Division of ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY","abbr":"DEB"},"pgm":{"id":"1269","name":"STATISTICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0801","name":"Division of ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY","abbr":"DEB"},"pgm":{"id":"1366","name":"BIOCOMPLEXITY"}}],"PIcoPI":["263931","286130","548851"],"PO":["564220"]},"43347":{"abstract":"This award is for NSF co-sponsorship of an international workshop with the European Science Foundation (ESF) and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). The workshop will be held December 3-5, 1999 in Laxenburg, Austria. The objectives of the workshop are threefold: First, it will identify the main critical issues within this broad area and delineate the interrelationships among them; second, it will take stock of the present state of knowledge and of ongoing research concerning collaboration technologies and factors affecting their deployment and use; and third, it will provide a forum for discussion about further research on the co-evolution of technological, institutional and organizational infrastructures affecting the conduct of collaborative science on a global scale. Three substantive themes will be addressed: 1) how to characterize the technological opportunities encapsulated by the concept of a virtual laboratory; 2) the practical issues involved in organizing and conducting scientific work at a distance; and 3) the interaction between intellectual property issues and access to virtual libraries and data archives. NSF sponsorship will enable the participation of non-European experts in this workshop by funding US and Russia participants' travel to Europe. It will also enable the workshop organizers to commission revised and expanded papers for a post-workshop publication.","title":"Workshop on Digital Collaboration Technologies, the Organization of Scientific Work and the Economics of Knowledge Access to be held December 3-5, 1999 in Laxenburg, Austria","awardID":"9912477","effectiveDate":"1999-11-15","expirationDate":"2001-11-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0406","name":"Office of INTL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING","abbr":"OISE"},"pgm":{"id":"5979","name":"CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE PROGR"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6850","name":"DIGITAL SOCIETY&TECHNOLOGIES"}}],"PIcoPI":["228091"],"PO":["495796"]},"58497":{"abstract":"","title":"Wireless Transmission of Low Bit-Rate Video","awardID":"0096168","effectiveDate":"1999-11-15","expirationDate":"2001-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4091","name":"NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":[150285,"472358"],"PO":["150490"]},"40786":{"abstract":"This award funds a two day workshop on Internet Service Qualities to provide a unique opportunity for academics, researcher, business leaders and policymakers to present and discuss their research plans and results and gain a better understanding of the rapidly changing environment for Internet integrated services.
