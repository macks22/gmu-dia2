This project uses applications' common characteristics to drive the development of coordination support for delay-tolerant networks by simplifying application development and providing an expressiveness that enables new classes of fluid and responsive applications. The project begins by developing an understanding of coordination in delay-tolerant networks by developing a theory of temporally extended conversations among communicating parties. To support these conversations, the research also examines the creation of new communication protocols that adapt their behavior in response to changing conditions, enabling the communication infrastructure to continue to meet applications' requirements, even as the network's operating conditions change. To support this adaptation, the project develops new notions of context-awareness, or the ability to collect and interpret information about an application's environment.

Molecular profiling usually entails collection of a massive amount of features (i.e., large p) for only a small number of biological individuals (i.e., small n), and therefore identifying the underlying sparse signatures presents a task of finding a very few needles in a haystack. A regularized orthogonal-components regression framework is proposed to address these challenges for effective dimension reduction and thus signature identification. Traditional unsupervised dimension reduction can be used to exclude many features from constructed sparse signatures, but the false discovery rate can be very high. On the other hand, available supervised dimension reduction ignores the sparse nature of the underlying signatures. Furthermore, all these methods assume that the feature values are accurately measured, and do not incorporate functional relatedness of candidates. As a result, despite years of searching, only a handful of predictive bio-markers have advanced to general clinical practice. Clearly, more effective approaches are needed to realize the true potential of predictive molecular signatures. The main idea behind this approach is to construct properly regularized orthogonal components using generalized thresholding estimators which can be implemented by a Bayesian approach. Such a Bayesian implementation will provide a flexible structure for realizing different types of regularization. For example, a sparsity-oriented regularization (SORE) will provide sparse signatures, while a locality-oriented regularization (LORE) will be able to incorporate the structure of features (e.g. functional relatedness). Indeed, even the implementation with a simple SORE has certain ability to identify signatures with clustered features. Furthermore, the proposed framework is naturally enabled to integrate collinear or nearly collinear features. Such properties will make it possible to relieve the effects of measurement errors in observed feature values. Preliminary studies show that this new framework, even implemented with a very simple SORE, provides a clear and significant benefit to the general task of variable selection in the large p small n paradigm with clustered features. A simulation study demonstrated that it can reduce as much as 79% of the loss, and decrease the FDR from 41% to 9%. It confirmed the utility of the new method in molecular signature identification, thus indicating an enormous promise for its use in early disease detection, assessment of prognosis, measurement of drug efficacy, and eventually, personalized medicine. The full potential of the new framework, however, lies in providing breakthrough solutions to structured noisy features. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts<br\/>Molecular signatures are crucial for understanding complex biological systems.

This project explores the performance improvements made possible by taking advantage of feedback at the physical-layer. The principal investigator (PI) has demonstrated how to exploit noisy feedback by shifting to an error-and-erasures perspective, utilizing identification codes on the reverse link, and making novel use of unequal error protection.

Computer hardware that is operated according to the laws of quantum mechanics can realize novel quantum protocols and bring enormous speed-up for certain computationally hard problems. The key issue in implementing such hardware is in achieving highly accurate and fast control on the quantum logic elements so that they can beat the hazardous effects from the environmental noise. For solid-state quantum processors, including superconducting systems and semiconductor systems, such control is usually achieved via adjustable local parameters, where careful designing of the circuit and the connections to external sources are required. In this project, a quantum global mode will be exploited to achieve efficient implementation of the quantum protocols. Here, the quantum global mode is the microwave photon mode in a nanoscale quantum resonator that has millimeter wavelength, can couple with multiple quantum logic elements simultaneously, and has demonstrated microsecond quantum coherence times. Meanwhile, the global mode will also be considered as a probe to measure quantum entanglement and quantum coherence effects in the solid-state quantum processors. Two questions will be studied in this project. First, solid-state quantum simulators that can emulate quantum many-body systems involving arrays of solid-state elements will be studied, where the global quantum mode will act as a control as well as a detector of the quantum phase transitions in the simulators. Second, a universal quantum computer of spurious two-level fluctuators in the superconducting system will be studied where the global mode can provide individual control, effective coupling, and readout of the fluctuator states.

Such codes pervade our daily lives, with applications ranging from computer hard-disks and UPS bar-codes to cell phones and the Internet to deep space communication. One of the most fundamental questions in coding theory is the following: What is the largest possible fraction of errors that a code of information rate R can correct? Recent theoretical breakthroughs provide a complete answer to this question, namely that the ultimate error-correction radius of 1-R can be reached (by codes over sufficiently large alphabets). Moreover, it can be reached constructively with polynomial-time list decoding, via codes closely related to Reed-Solomon codes, which are ubiquitous in practice.<br\/><br\/>From a practical standpoint, this promises a factor of two improvement over classical error-correction algorithms that are in widespread use today. While this is extremely encouraging, numerous challenges must be overcome in order to bring the theoretical promise of the recent results to practice. This project, led by a multi-disciplinary team, involves an integrated collection of research activities targeted at progress towards the long term goal of attaining the fundamental limit of error-correction. At the theoretical end, the goals include improving the complexity of the decoding algorithms as one approaches the optimal error-correction radius of 1-R, and devising faster algorithms and heuristics for the key steps involved in algebraic list decoding. The project also studies methods to reap the practical benefits of combining the new codes with soft-decision decoding, putting to use the ample amount of probabilistic symbol reliability estimates often available to decoders. Furthermore, the research lays the groundwork for eventual implementation of such algorithms in high-speed\/low-power VLSI, thereby enabling the potential deployment of the new codes in a broad range of communication and storage systems. On the education front, the project provides a stimulating research environment for graduate students, encouraging team-work across university boundaries and collaboration across disciplines (computer science, communication theory, and VLSI design).","title":"Collaborative Research: CDI-Type I: Realizing the Ultimate Potential of List Error-Correction: Theory, Practice, and Applications","awardID":"0953155","effectiveDate":"2009-06-15","expirationDate":"2012-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7750","name":"CDI TYPE I"}}],"PIcoPI":["485293"],"PO":["565157"]},"153867":{"abstract":"Quantum computers offer the potential to exponentially speed up the solution of certain classically hard computational problems. It is already known, for example, that quantum computers can efficiently factor numbers (something modern computers cannot do), and this fact implies that quantum computers can break the majority of cryptographic systems which protect our nation's cyber-infrastructure. The quantum factoring algorithm is the main motivation behind current research into actually building a quantum computer. In this grant, the investigator proposes a new approach to efficiently solving a computational problem--the graph isomorphism problem--which might also admit an exponential speedup over the best classical algorithm for the problem. The graph isomorphism problem is to tell whether two given graphs (a collection of vertices with edges connecting them) can be made to look identical to each other by permuting the different vertices. The approach taken here is different from that taken by the majority of the quantum algorithms community and centers on a novel class of quantum random walks, those in which the walkers carry topological quantum numbers. This approach follows from a series of failed proposals to graph isomorphism based on random walks by hard-core bosons or fermions and is motivated by the form in which these proposals fail. Finding an efficient quantum algorithm for the graph isomorphism problem would be potentially transformative and would provide a major new justification for building a large quantum computer. The approach chosen by the PI also introduces a novel quantum algorithm technique--quantum random walks by anyons--which has the potential to be useful a primitive outside of the graph isomorphism problem. Finally, the award will be used to support the training of graduate students who work on the boundary between computer science and physics, and thus strengthen connections across this interdisciplinary divide.","title":"AF: Small: Graph Isomorphism and Quantum Random Walks by Anyons","awardID":"0916400","effectiveDate":"2009-06-01","expirationDate":"2013-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7796","name":"ALGORITHMIC FOUNDATIONS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7928","name":"QUANTUM COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["517581","483594","499728","499728"],"PO":["565157"]},"153758":{"abstract":"\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009<br\/>(Public Law 111-5).\"<br\/><br\/><br\/>Optical Diffusion Tomography, with Application to In Vivo Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Imaging <br\/><br\/>Kevin Webb, Purdue University<br\/><br\/>Optical sensing and imaging will continue to become more important for in vivo medicine. In most cases, light can be modeled with a diffusion equation, and the reconstruction of images based on this model is the basis of optical diffusion tomography (ODT). Enhanced contrast can be achieved with targeting of a fluorophore to cancer cells, for example, and targeted anti-cancer drugs can be delivered. Another molecular imaging opportunity involves fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) parameters. FRET has proved to be of immense value in the study of chemical transport into cells and the underlying cause of disease, and by coupling to ODT (FRET-ODT), there is the opportunity to transfer this knowledge to in vivo studies. While substantial progress has been made in various ODT modalities, the achievable resolution and the computational burden impede effective applications. More efficient imaging strategies are thus essential. <br\/><br\/>This research involves the development of a method for deep tissue imaging of FRET parameters (FRET-ODT) and fast, accurate and robust methods for optical diffusion tomography. The recent demonstration by the Webb group that it is possible to image FRET parameters using heavily scattered light is being expanded into a method for imaging FRET in vivo. This involves a solution for the intramolecular FRET parameters with both rigid and flexible linkers that are incorporated as unknown sources in a diffusion equation representation for the donor fluorescence. Multigrid algorithms are being developed and applied to fluorescence imaging and FRET-ODT. A model-based non-iterative image reconstruction method, that has proved to substantially reduce computation time in preliminary studies, is being applied to image FRET kinetic parameters.","title":"CIF: Small: Optical Diffusion Tomography, with Application to in Vivo Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Imaging","awardID":"0915966","effectiveDate":"2009-06-01","expirationDate":"2013-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7936","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING"}}],"PIcoPI":["518523"],"PO":["564898"]},"160237":{"abstract":"This research involves one of the key challenges in wireless networks: how <br\/>to take advantage of new advances at the physical layer to push for new <br\/>design at the upper layers.

The long-running VL\/HCC series occupies a unique niche among HCI and Programming Language conferences, in that it focuses specifically on how to help humans successfully develop and use software. The diversity and ubiquity of people's goals, interactions, and concerns with information systems is continually increasing. Not only does interactive computer software permeate many individuals' working lives, people commonly rely on computing and information systems for leisure and home activities as well. As a result, end users now expect considerable flexibility and control in their interactions with computer software. For many, it is no longer sufficient to consume the packaged software and scripted tasks developed by the professional software industry; they now must produce their own computational solutions to a wide variety of problems, including spreadsheet models, web sites, educational media and simulations, automated business procedures, and visualizations. To produce such software, even for domain-specific problems, end users must look beyond surface-level interaction with computers and acquire the conceptual models and skills of computational thinking. But current advances toward computational thinking by end users are not evenly distributed across all segments of the population. Thus, this year's VL\/HCC Doctoral Consortium, the seventh to be funded by NSF in this series, will focus on expanding the benefits of computational thinking to diverse populations. Ensuring that designers of computational languages and tools consider the needs of populations historically overlooked in information technology will increase the chance that these individuals\/groups are able to learn and use the more powerful tools that are fast becoming essential to information literacy. At the same time, such efforts may lead researchers to identify new software construction metaphors and techniques that increase the usability of their languages and environments more generally. The workshop's primary goal is to stimulate graduate students' and other researchers' thinking about how varying communication media, representations, and problem-solving support affect end users' willingness and ability to access, manipulate, and program solutions to their work or everyday problems. What are the special needs of disadvantaged populations? How can computational problem-solving tools and devices be designed to meet these needs? The workshop will bring together and build community among young researchers working on different aspects of these problems from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education. It will guide the work of these new researchers by providing an opportunity for experts in the research field (as well as their peers) to give them advice, in that student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive feedback from a faculty panel. The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether the results are appropriately analyzed and presented. As in prior years the VL\/HCC 2009 Doctoral Consortium will be part of the regular conference program. A 2-page extended abstract of each participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The workshop will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at alleviating a pressing problem of relevance to a great many people within our society. This event will promote discovery and learning, by encouraging the student researchers to explore a difficult and challenging open problem, through involvement of a panel of well-known researchers whose task is to provide constructive feedback, and through inclusion of other conference participants who will also learn from and provide additional feedback to the students and to each other. The PI and the members of the organizing committee will make special efforts to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary group of student participants, with special attention paid to recruitment of minorities and females. The PI expects that most of the students supported by this award will come from U.S. universities but as in past years, due to the highly international make-up of the research community, a few non-U.S. students may be invited to participate as well.","title":"WORKSHOP: VL\/HCC'09 Doctoral Consortium: Democratizing Access to Computational Tools","awardID":"0929989","effectiveDate":"2009-06-01","expirationDate":"2010-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["548140"],"PO":["565227"]},"157296":{"abstract":"The purpose of this travel grant is to support 10-12 graduate students from the United States, particularly those from underrepresented groups and institutions that traditionally lack funding for such support, to attend the 10th IEEE International Symposium on World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networking (WoWMoM 2009) that will be held in Kos, Greece, from June 15 to June 18, 2009.

To mitigate this, there is growing industry interest towards home-centered approaches to health care. Leveraging technology advances is seen as one of the primary enablers of the home-care paradigm. To this end, this project is investigating the development of smart wheelchair technologies. There are three significant technical components. The first is<br\/>the use of large-scale, three-dimensional maps to support accurate wheelchair localization in outdoor, urban environments even in the absence of reliable GPS measurements. This is accomplished through automated synthesis of map models a priori to locate stable, robust landmark features that the wheelchair can use at runtime. The motivation is that by leveraging maps generated from high fidelity\/cost sensor systems, lower-cost service robots gain many of the benefits of these sensors but without the cost. This is critical for the technology to be commercially viable in the future. The second is an optimization-based framework for motion planning in crowds that will enable the smart wheelchair to maneuver safely in the presence of large numbers of pedestrians and static\/dynamic obstacles. This approach builds upon recent advances in convex optimization theory, and explicitly integrates higher-level models of wheelchair-pedestrian dynamics through interactive control functions to improve navigation performance. Finally, there is a significant development and test component planned through a collaboration with Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Hospital in Allentown, PA. This will provide critical service provider and end user input into system development.","title":"CAREER: Towards Autonomous Wheelchair Systems in Urban Environments","awardID":"0844585","effectiveDate":"2009-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["475316"],"PO":["562760"]},"146594":{"abstract":"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009<br\/>(Public Law 111-5).<br\/><br\/>As computers become more powerful, the limiting factor for building software systems is shifting away from the underlying computer's performance limitations to the software's inherent complexity. One way to cope with this complexity is to use software contracts to separate a large system into smaller chunks, thereby enabling programmers to focus their energy on just one small part of the system at a time. A key feature of this separation is the ability to assign blame; that is, when the software system fails, a contract checker can use the contracts to identify a single sub-system as faulty, automatically narrowing the search for the underlying cause of the failure to that one subsystem or possibly its contract; of course, fixing a bug in a contract may yet expose latent bugs in other subsystems but in each case the contract system will help the programmer identify the failure. Even better, software contracts are typically written in a language that is very close to the programming language, meaning that programmers only have to invest a little bit of their time and resources in order to start seeing the benefits of contracts.<br\/><br\/>This work promises to improve the state of the art in contract checking. Specifically, the PI will study the interaction between statically and dynamically verified portions of systems, in a manner similar to hybrid and gradual types. Building on this integration, the PI will also study how to integrate theorem provers into software systems in a way that the theorem prover's scope can be limited to just the most mission-critical parts of the system. The PI will also study how to add contracts to more sophisticated modularity mechanisms like traits and the ML module system, and explore how contracts can help generalize existing techniques for automatic test case and test oracle generation to support higher-order functions and unknown classes. All the while, the PI will ensure that these new techniques are practically viable by using them in a 500,000 line software system that the he maintains, as well as conducting detailed studies of how contracts are used in other settings, including JML and Eiffel.","title":"CAREER: Lightweight, Blame-aware Contract Checking","awardID":"0846012","effectiveDate":"2009-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7944","name":"SOFTWARE ENG & FORMAL METHODS"}}],"PIcoPI":["518591"],"PO":["564388"]},"146243":{"abstract":"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br\/><br\/>Quantum computing is a scientific field that combines some of the deepest intellectual concerns of computer science and physics. Ultimately, we want to know: what is and is not feasibly computable in the physical universe? After fifteen years of effort, quantum computing theory seems to have reached a point where further progress will necessarily entail progress in classical computing theory. The proposed research embraces this with concrete ideas for advancing both fields and will deepen the connections between quantum computing and frontier topics in classical complexity theory.<br\/><br\/><br\/>This research tackles some of the hardest \"barrier problems\" about the power of classical and quantum computers. Examples of such problems include: how large is the class of problems that admit efficient quantum algorithms? Can we obtain evidence that this class lies outside the entire \"polynomial hierarchy\" of classical computation---which, loosely speaking, would imply that quantum computers could solve certain problems much faster than classical computers could even check the answers? Are there \"unstructured\" problems that quantum computers can solve exponentially faster than classical computers, in addition to \"structured\" problems such as finding the period of a periodic function (the heart of Shor's factoring algorithm)? Can we go beyond the idealized \"black-box model\" that encompasses almost everything complexity theorists currently know about the power of quantum computers, to obtain \"non-relativizing results\" that exploit the structure of quantum circuits?

But while many interesting models have been developed, and some of these have even produced interesting creative works, most have been built on foundations that either don't scale, or don't easily scope across different domains, or both. In this project the PI will explore an alternative in which creativity, and in particular humor, is modeled as a layered system of intelligent control, using case-based reasoning, of simple retrieval and filtering mechanisms. Specifically, this is an effort, in the realm of believable comedy agents, in which the issues of control and breadth are decoupled and handled by two very different sorts of systems. For control, the PI will use a variant of case-based planning to provide task-level guidance to content acquisition, evaluation, transformation, combination, and presentation; for breadth, he will employ lexical technologies from information retrieval that will be used to mine online resources spanning a wide variety of domains. The PI's goal is to provide a model of creativity and humor that works in much the same way that a professional comedy writer or improvisational performer does. These professionals \"mine\" their memories for experiences, but they do not merely \"free associate.\" Instead, they employ a set of conventions or techniques that can be applied and scoped across any domain to produce a specific comedic effect. Modeling human skill in this way will result in a robust and scalable system that is able to provide breadth of coverage (through well understood and scalable information retrieval techniques), without sacrificing the power of control provided by the reasoning system. In effect, it will be funny no matter what it is talking about. This research will improve our understanding of creative processes through an examination of machine-generated content, and the creation of new content and content forms derived from existing resources. It will also support the development of new technologies to support human creativity, in that the resulting models and systems will enable high-level authoring of new kinds of interactive \"information\" experiences.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The PI expects that at least two broad societal impacts will derive from this work. First, he will actually create intelligent comedic performance agents and deploy them both on- and off-line for the enjoyment and illumination of everyday citizens. Second, this research will attract, develop, and produce an equally new type of AI researcher whose vision of the mind scopes beyond the confines of a single machine. In particular, the goal is to attract a broader set of students (including the underrepresented group of women in engineering) from communications studies and theater, who want to do research on the machine as a device for communication and creative expression made possible and supported by the mediation of intelligent systems. The PI believes this is a crucial step in the development of AI as a field, drawing in a next generation of creative and innovative thinkers who will be able to bring new light into the world of semantics and inference while building artifacts with artistic power.","title":"Major: Computational Creativity: Building a Model of Machine Generated Humor","awardID":"0856058","effectiveDate":"2009-06-01","expirationDate":"2013-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7788","name":"CreativeIT"}}],"PIcoPI":["410052","410053"],"PO":["565227"]},"146310":{"abstract":"The Internet will shape the history of the 21st century. Governments around the world realize this, which is why, out of 40 countries studied by the Open Net Initiative, Internet censorship increased from 3 of 40 in 2002 to 26 of 40 in 2007. The U.S. must set effective policy regarding this, but the inherently computational issues lead to a great deal of uncertainty. We are studying the dynamics of modern Internet censorship implementations to understand how their low-level mechanisms (for example, at the level of individual Internet packets) affects the application-level behavior of censorship that web users actually experience.<br\/><br\/>Internet censorship implementations are inherently computational, thus whether or not content is available to a user can depend on key issues such as routing and protocol dynamics. Current characterizations of censorship are incomplete, not founded on quantitative measurements, and cite experiments that cannot be reproduced. We are addressing this by laying a solid computational foundation for Internet censorship research. Central to this effort is Internet measurement of existing censorship implementations to understand and compare their dynamics at the packet- and application-level. This will impact both policy development and the future design of computer networks to address Internet censorship, a critical issue that directly harms U.S. interests by hindering the ability of human rights organizations and U.S. government agencies to disseminate information. Understanding the connections between Internet censorship and computational issues will also enable the integration of this research throughout the computer science curriculum at UNM and other institutions.","title":"CAREER: Internet Measurement in the Cat's Cradle of Global Internet Censorship","awardID":"0844880","effectiveDate":"2009-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"8060","name":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":["548106"],"PO":["565327"]},"146552":{"abstract":"\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009<br\/>(Public Law 111-5).\"<br\/><br\/>CAREER: Information Theory and Coding for Wireless Broadcast Networks<br\/><br\/>Broadcast is a fundamental nature of wireless communication. With appropriate coding architecture, the broadcast nature of wireless communication can be used to the advantage of simultaneously transmitting to several receivers at high rates. Most of the previous work focused on the following two scenarios: 1) to deliver the same message to each of the receivers; 2) to deliver completely different messages to different receivers. Between these two ?extreme? broadcast scenarios, there is a rich collection of ?intermediate? problems with message sets of interesting configuration and significant engineering appeal. Understanding the limits and the appropriate coding architectures of broadcast networks with general message set configurations is a relatively unexplored challenge that must be addressed to fully harness the broadcast advantage of wireless communication.<br\/><br\/>This research takes a fundamental information-theoretic view of broadcast networks to shed insight into what coding architectures are appropriate for different message set configurations. An important component of this study is the focus on concrete and physically motivated models of wireless network communication. Of particular interest is to understand the impact of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication. Specifically, this research studies: 1) the impact of message set configuration on the appropriate coding architecture of wireless broadcast networks; 2) secrecy communication under physically motivated models; and 3) the value of receiver message side information for broadcast network communication. The research program is complemented by an educational effort to train the next generation of engineers to become skilled in the design of wireless networks, which involves developing a new course on information theory for wireless systems and writing an accompanied textbook.","title":"CAREER: Information Theory and Coding for Wireless Broadcast Networks","awardID":"0845848","effectiveDate":"2009-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7937","name":"NETWORK CODING AND INFO THEORY"}}],"PIcoPI":["297790"],"PO":["564924"]},"146343":{"abstract":"Proposal ID: 0844995, PI Name: Mohammad Tehranipoor, PI Institution: University of Connecticut, Title: CAREER: Novel Techniques for Detecting and Localizing Hardware Trojans in Integrated Circuits<br\/><br\/>Abstract: <br\/><br\/>Design and fabrication of integrated circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly vulnerable to malicious activities and alterations with globalization. These vulnerabilities have raised serious concerns regarding possible threats to many critical applications. An adversary can introduce a Trojan designed to disable and\/or destroy a system at some future time or the Trojan may serve to leak confidential information covertly to the adversary. This research develops efficient procedures for detection of malicious alterations and subtle modifications in integrated circuits. Side-channel signal analysis methods as well on-chip measurement structures are developed to detect and localize the inserted Trojans in very deep submicron ICs. Novel design-for-hardware-trust techniques are developed in this project to increase the capabilities and effectiveness of the detection and isolation strategies. <br\/><br\/>The Intellectual Merit of the research is the development of techniques optimized to improve the level of confidence that an IC will carry out its intended function and nothing more. The broader impact is (i) the development of techniques for hardware authentication that would be of interests to US government, agencies and many fab-less semiconductor companies, (ii) the societal benefits that include trustworthy electronics for healthcare, defense weapons and dependable computing platforms for intelligence, weather forecasting, and transportation, (iii) the education of undergraduate and graduate students, (iv) the development of new courses, and (v) the dissemination of data and methodologies to researchers in academia and industry.","title":"CAREER: Novel Techniques for Detecting and Localizing Hardware Trojans in Integrated Circuits","awardID":"0844995","effectiveDate":"2009-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"8060","name":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace"}}],"PIcoPI":["560771"],"PO":["565264"]},"149687":{"abstract":"Proposal Number: 0900952<br\/>PI: David Evans<br\/>Institution: University of Virginia Main Campus<br\/>Lead<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>Title: Workshop on the Science of Security<br\/><br\/>As our Nation increasingly depends on computers and networks for national defense and for running its critical infrastructures, such as the Power Grid and the financial networks, adversaries have become interested in attacking our systems in order to achieve financial gain, to cause major disruption to services or to extract sensitive information. To cope with these serious threats, there has been much activity to improve the security or our Nation?s systems, much of it initiated in the research community but motivated by real and current security problems.<br\/><br\/>Because of the pressing need for solutions to immediate threats, the security research community has not focused enough on evolving security into a science. As a result, many of the solutions are ad hoc, address only particular threats, and, most important, are not amenable to evaluation. The comment complaint is that there is no theory (or experimental methodology or infrastructure) that supports the security evaluation of systems. <br\/><br\/>The purpose of this workshop is to explore approaches to create a science of security that will address the lack of principles that can help engineer secure systems and can lead to their evaluation. Such principles can relate to models of attacks and of attackers, the ability to reason about the resilience of a system, the ability to compare the security of systems, the ability to compose systems with known security characteristics to produce a system also with known security characteristics. <br\/><br\/>A workshop to engage the research community towards a science of security is proposed. A two-day workshop is planned, to be organized by an ad hoc committee composed of security experts from academia, experts from other fields where there is an established science in the expectation that the security community can learn from such successes, experts from research institutions, important industry leaders, and Government PMs.","title":"Workshop on the Science of Security","awardID":"0900952","effectiveDate":"2009-06-01","expirationDate":"2011-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"I160","name":"National Security Agency"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"I231","name":"Central Intelligence Agency"}}],"PIcoPI":["483825"],"PO":["497499"]},"159125":{"abstract":"Computational sustainability is an emerging field, developing and applying computational methods, notably of articial intelligence, to difficult problems of long-term environmental and societal sustainability.
