How does the QWERTY keyboard perform in communities whose language has no \"Q\", \"W\", \"E\", \"R\", \"T\", nor \"Y\"? What is the point of a personal computer in a context where technologies are not held for a person but are shared by a whole community? Computer applications and PC appliances have traditionally been designed by and for Western high-income populations. But today the Internet and internet-enabled computers have become a truly global phenomenon, reaching out to many of the most remote and marginalized communities. This workshop will be held on Saturday and Sunday, April 4-5, as an official part of the ACM 2009 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2009) in Boston. The workshop will explore interaction design in the context of international development, and in particular will address interaction design for parts of the world that are often marginalized by current systems and applications designers. The PI believes that to extend the boundaries of existing practice in designing information and communication technologies, design should be with, for, and of the marginalized communities he plans to set centre stage in the workshop discussions. The workshop will provide a forum to exchange experiences, to explore differences between developed and developing world contexts, to develop new partnerships, and to learn from each other's experiences. NSF funding will enable approximately ten international delegates to attend from low-income countries, from which participation would otherwise be impossible; without the active involvement of these participants, the outcomes of the workshop would be far less useful and effective.<br\/><br\/>The annual CHI conference, sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (ACM SIGCHI), is a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and practice. The conference is attended by over 2,000 professionals from around the world. Research papers presented at the conference are heavily-refereed and widely cited; they constitute some of the most scientifically respected research publications in the field of HCI.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: A review of the HCI literature exposes the broad intellectual gap that exists between problems of computer interaction and studies of the development impact of computer technologies in low-income countries. The PI expects that this workshop, building on the outcomes of two previous meetings at CHI 2007 (funded in part by NSF) and CHI 2008 (which led to establishment of a website http:\/\/hci4d.org that provides a platform for exchange of information, ideas, and experiences in this domain), will be instrumental in developing additional intellectual momentum around these topic areas. Position papers generated as part of the workshop and summary articles will be published in a special issue of the journal Information Technology and International Development, as well as in ACM Interactions, Interfaces magazine, and Usability News. The PI is also working on a story-based template, which will provide an online repository for reporting findings and observations that can be easily searched and shared.","title":"Workshop at the ACM CHI 2009 Conference: Human-centered Computing in International Development","awardID":"0925660","effectiveDate":"2009-04-01","expirationDate":"2009-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["531482"],"PO":["565227"]},"158103":{"abstract":"PROJECT SUMMARY<br\/><br\/><br\/>The Sixteenth Annual East Coast Computer Algebra Day (ECCAD?2009) will be held at the University of Rhode Island in Kingston on Saturday, May 2, 2009. The purpose of the meeting is to stimulate interest and enhance understanding of the technical and applied aspects of computer algebra. The conference provides a forum for those interested in becoming more active in computer algebra to participate, interact, and meet with others in an inexpensive and easily accessible way. ECCAD is a one-day meeting that is more informal than other technical conferences in the field, with ample time for unstructured interaction. Participation by graduate students and junior faculty is particularly encouraged through special invitation to contribute to the poster session and software demonstrations, and through travel support.<br\/>The meeting will include presentations by four invited speakers who have made outstanding contributions in the field of computer algebra. These speakers will anchor the meeting and help attract participants. There will also be a special panel on Future Directions in Computer Algebra, along with the poster and demonstration session. The invited talks, panel, and poster session are expected to cover the entire range of computer algebra: algorithms, systems, and applications. The contributed posters and software demonstrations will enable researchers, especially junior faculty and graduate students, to publicize their recent findings and to make new contacts.<br\/>This year's ECCAD is only the second to be held in New England. With many colleges and universities in the area, it is hoped that the meeting will be able to draw a large number of attendees and to generate new interest in computer algebra.","title":"East Coast Computer Algebra Day 2009","awardID":"0934110","effectiveDate":"2009-04-15","expirationDate":"2010-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7933","name":"NUM, SYMBOL, & ALGEBRA COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":[422091],"PO":["550329"]},"146399":{"abstract":"A perspective camera captures the spatial relationships of objects in a scene as they would appear from a single viewpoint.

The PI also investigates several new 3D reconstruction methods, such as epsilon stereo matching, ray-curvature analysis, and curvature-from-distortions, for a broad class of multi-perspective cameras. On the graphics front, the PI explores practical multi-perspective display architectures by combining a consumer projector with specially-shaped mirrors\/lenses.

Most existing rehabilitation approaches and modeling work supporting them focus primarily on the forces required to generate controlled movements, in effect deemphasizing planning that occurs at a kinematic level. A thorough understanding of the role of kinematics in coordination is needed to help diagnose the level at which deficiencies lie, and then focus treatment at that level. In this project, the PI will formulate and experimentally validate unified, coherent models of human motor coordination based on a foundational time-invariant, kinematic mapping between the output space and the control space. Inspired by curvature theory, which is traditionally applied to mechanism synthesis, such a mapping provides an elegant description of motion. With this novel approach, the PI will seek to demonstrate that decoupling the kinematic geometry from the time-based trajectory tracking of arm motion leads to a compact internal model of path planning consistent with experimental data. The work will further demonstrate that a similarly compact internal dynamic model provides an additional layer for an efficient formulation of motor control. The internal kinematic and dynamic models to be developed will enable investigation of optimization mechanisms at the kinematic level, the dynamic level, and through mutual interaction of the two. In order to experimentally validate this model, the PI will develop an actuated, but back-drivable, planar x-y table that has uniform apparent endpoint inertia throughout its workspace. This device will both enable the model validation experiments and serve as a first prototype for a new robot-assisted rehabilitation device that can be used to clinically leverage the knowledge gained from the modeling effort. The PI will collaborate with colleagues in his institution's Physical Therapy Division and Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department to develop and evaluate new diagnostic and rehabilitation techniques that implement the new device based on the findings.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Robot-assisted rehabilitation is likely to have an increasingly significant impact on society as health care costs rise and the number of strokes increases with population aging. Grounded in understanding human motor coordination, this research will impact the fields of locomotion, neurally controlled prosthetics, digital human modeling, and robot control. The investigator will integrate this research into his educational activities with two foci: increasing student understanding of the significance of kinematics and dynamics in human motor coordination; and enhancing student ability to internally visualize physical movement in mechanical systems. These activities will involve modifications to a required undergraduate kinematics course, an elective undergraduate product design course, and two graduate kinematics courses to incorporate the results of the research. Additionally, a seminar course for students from all academic units will be developed to more broadly disseminate the work. In conjunction with four other faculty in the Ohio State College of Engineering, the PI will organize a weeklong engineering summer camp for women and minority high school students. The PI will create two modules for the camp: one related to human motor coordination in which the students will conduct experiments using the x-y table developed in the project; and one related to visualization of motion in mechanical systems.","title":"CAREER: Modeling Time Invariances in Human Motor Coordination for Robot-Assisted Rehabilitation","awardID":"0937612","effectiveDate":"2009-04-01","expirationDate":"2012-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["524608"],"PO":["565227"]},"154579":{"abstract":"This award supports a Doctoral Consortium to be held in conjunction with the 2009 Conference on Communities and Technologies, June 24-27, 2009.

Modeling studies have demonstrated that systems constituted of spiking neurons can have dynamics that are starkly different from those of systems whose constituent units interact via continuously varying quantities. This project is aimed at deciphering the core dynamical and computational properties of networks of spiking neurons, a formal understanding of which is necessary to comprehend how the brain, or any part thereof, works.<br\/><br\/>A prerequisite for such a program is the choice of a mathematical model for networks of spiking neurons that is at once biologically realistic and is amenable to formal analysis. In prior work, Arunava Banerjee has formulated one such model that is founded on the observation that a neuron is in essence a device that transforms multiple input sequences of spikes arriving at its various afferent synapses into an output sequence of spikes on its axon. Building on this model, this project aims to answer a broad set of interrelated questions concerning the nature of computation in feed-forward and recurrent networks of spiking neurons.<br\/><br\/>For continuous input-output systems, the Volterra\/Wiener approach to system identification has led to a highly successful account of the levels of complexity inherent to transforming functionals. This project will formulate and analyze a corresponding framework that is applicable to feed-forward networks whose inputs and outputs are both spike trains. Next, the relationship between the input-output transformation of a feed-forward network and its information transmission capacity, as well as the nature of the recoding of information, will be analyzed. Networks driven by artificially generated realistic input spike trains shall be used to address this issue. The educational aspect of the project will focus on achieving two simultaneous objectives: attracting undergraduate women with an interest in the Biological Sciences to the field of Computer Science, and introducing senior undergraduate and beginning graduate Computer Science students to the basic neurobiology of the brain.","title":"Formal Characterization and Analysis of Computation in Networks of Spiking Neurons","awardID":"0902230","effectiveDate":"2009-04-01","expirationDate":"2011-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["499431"],"PO":["564318"]},"151699":{"abstract":"Proposal Number: IIS - 0907889<br\/>PI: John Gero<br\/>Institution: George Mason University<br\/><br\/>The Problem: Visual and spatial reasoning often play pivotal roles in design creativity, most noticeably through sketching, diagrams, visualization and visual imagery. There is research on visual and spatial reasoning in multiple disciplines but very little is focused on design creativity. There is a need to bring this research to bear onto design creativity to improve it. <br\/><br\/>The Proposal: This Workshop brings together the leading researchers from the disciplines that carry out research into visual and spatial reasoning of relevance to design creativity: <br\/><br\/> design science, <br\/> computer science, <br\/> cognitive science, and <br\/> neuroscience <br\/><br\/>in order to define the state-of-the-art and to produce the opportunity for transdisciplinary activity related to design creativity. The workshop format allows a focus on discussion and groups work on research agendas and grand challenges. Presentations are catalysts for discussion rather than the primary focus. To improve international collaboration, the workshop is held in France. One doctoral student from each area is also invited. <br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: Each of the four sciences studies visual and spatial reasoning in isolation without a focus on design creativity. Bringing together researchers from these different communities provides opportunities for transdisciplinary research. Making designing the focus is expected to result in knowledge about processes for studying visual and spatial reasoning that will produce new knowledge about design creativity. One enduring output of the workshop will be archival proceedings, expected to be published by Springer. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: Design creativity holds the key to transformational products and processes. The outcomes of this workshop will form the basis of the development of a research agenda for visual and spatial reasoning in design creativity and provide the basis for an education agenda to improve the creativity of designers. The aim is to develop international research collaborations. Studying visual and spatial reasoning produces knowledge of design creativity. The knowledge derived from studying design creativity has the potential to form the foundations of new kinds of support tools for creative designing. Attention to a diverse and inclusive group of discussants, attention to design for social impact, and plans for a larger conference are also elements of the meeting.","title":"Two-Day Workshop: Studying Visual and Spatial Reasoning in Design Creativity","awardID":"0907889","effectiveDate":"2009-04-01","expirationDate":"2011-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7788","name":"CreativeIT"}}],"PIcoPI":["564585"],"PO":["565227"]},"152469":{"abstract":"The value of social computing environments has been demonstrated in many contexts, including web search, shared bookmarking and photo sharing, personal social networking, online support groups, and information resources such as Wikipedia.

The analyses of 3-D data are typically performed visually in routine clinical practice, and are done in 2-D on a slice-by-slice basis. Maximum intensity projections providing 2-D images of the 3-D data or qualitative volume renderings are also common. However, reliable quantitative volumetric 3-D and 4-D segmentation methods that are robust, user-friendly, and applicable to clinical practice are not routinely available. As such, a significant and possibly critical portion of the image information available in the acquired data may unfortunately be never used for clinical diagnostic purposes. <br\/><br\/>This research involves directly addressing the needs of automated segmentation and will result in novel methodologies and practical tools that greatly accelerate the pace of medical image analysis. The investigator studies the specific problems of optimally detecting single and multiple interacting surfaces in volumetric medical images. Surfaces with high-order smoothness are of particular interest. The newly introduced edge-weighted geometric graph representation for the surface detection problems allows incorporating a wide spectrum of image features into the formulation, admitting highly accurate segmentation results. However, it also brings tremendous computational challenges. The target geometric problems include highly smooth surface identification, geometric layer partitioning, surface reconstruction from noisy data, digital rays, constrained k-means clustering, and geometric multiple labeling. The application of computational geometry techniques to medical imaging is intellectually deep and will result in advances in both computational geometry and medicine. An important goal of this research is dissemination of implemented algorithms in software to medical domains. In doing this, it can help to further integrate computer science with medicine.

As more and more applications become web services (i.e., ``cloud applications'' in technology parlance), there is an increasing expectation that answers be obtained and provided in real time and at a scale that is capable of servicing millions of users at the same time. For many complex problems, this expectation forces a rethink of the solution paradigm. In particular, there is an increasing realization that the speed and scale requirements mean that the only way to provide the service is to decouple the solution process into two steps: one that precomputes a solution space to all possible problems, and possibly provides an encoding of it, and one that navigates the solution space. This research explores the decoupling paradigm in the context of answering shortest path and nearest neighbor queries in a spatial network, where the effect is to decouple the process of computing shortest paths along the network from the process of finding the nearest neighbors.<br\/><br\/>This research aims at increasing the accessibility to massive amounts of user generated data including maps, documents, videos, images, and music by speeding up the similarity searching task. This invariably involves taking advantage of ways to sort the data which also includes developing methods to build appropriate multidimensional and spatial indexes. By focusing on making use of GPUs and distributed processing, as well as decoupling via pre-computation, it brings the benefits of this increase in computing power to a wider range of users who often have this power at their disposal. In addition, by demonstrating the power obtained by the use of decoupling in computing nearest neighbors in a spatial network it stimulates the development of scalable solutions to other search problems.","title":"Scalable Geometric and High Dimensional Data Structures and Algorithms: A Parallel and Distributed Approach","awardID":"0830618","effectiveDate":"2009-04-01","expirationDate":"2012-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7929","name":"COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY"}}],"PIcoPI":["551003"],"PO":["565157"]},"148111":{"abstract":"Software safety is critical to many projects conducted<br\/>by both private industry and the government.

The focus of the GROUP Doctoral Consortium is the intellectual content of the students' doctoral dissertations. These dissertations represent state-of-the-art research in the study and development of organizational systems, information systems, social informatics, and computer supported cooperative work. The Doctoral Consortium creates a social network among the next generation of researchers and several senior researchers. Students and faculty are anticipated to be a diverse group on several dimensions (nationality, scientific discipline, gender, institutional affiliation, under-represented minority status), therefore participation in the consortium will broaden the students' intellectual and social perspectives at a critical stage in their professional development.","title":"Group09 Doctoral Consortium","awardID":"0922106","effectiveDate":"2009-04-01","expirationDate":"2011-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["498457"],"PO":["564456"]},"152293":{"abstract":"Studies of large-scale information technology (IT) development projects that include multiple groups of stakeholders have found that such projects are prone to conflict escalation and eventual project failure if care is not taken to repair intergroup conflict as it erupts or even to avoid it entirely. This project aims to understand what triggers intergroup conflict, or, more precisely, what the researchers call ?faultlines,? among stakeholders engaged in cyberinfrastructure development projects and, more specifically, in GENI, a virtual laboratory currently being prototyped to explore future internets at scale. Early identification of potential faultlines and their mitigation or repair are central to achieving positive stakeholder interactions and project success. <br\/><br\/>The research will consist of an in-depth longitudinal study of the social networks emerging in the GENI development and prototyping community over the next three years, using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. Social Network Analysis (SNA) will be used to understand the communication patterns among stakeholders, primarily based on electronic communications, e.g., email and wiki postings. Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) will be used to discern patterns in qualitative data, for example, from interviews, meeting minutes or project documents. The GENI social network will be studied at two levels, within development teams and across them ? at the larger GENI community level. <br\/><br\/>The management of large-scale IT development projects is challenging, in large part due to their sheer scale, scope and complexity. As a result, this research could have broad applicability. Understanding how conflict can be anticipated, avoided or mitigated has the potential to positively impact project stakeholders as well as the broader society, which is the ultimate beneficiary of the innovations that GENI may stimulate.","title":"Collaborative Research: IDENTIFYING FAULT LINES, CIRCUMVENTING FAULT LINE ERUPTIONS, AND MITIGATING THE EFFECTS OF FAULT LINES","awardID":"0909833","effectiveDate":"2009-04-15","expirationDate":"2014-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":[405707],"PO":["564993"]},"156572":{"abstract":"The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) proposes to fund student attendance at the 2009 Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference that will be held April 1-4 in Portland, Oregon.

NC has been shown to be a promising approach to enhance networking performance. However, many benefits of NC will not likely be realized fully when they are used naively with the existing wired and wireless infrastructures. This research consists of two primary efforts, aimed to develop theories and methodologies for optimally incorporating NC to a large body of existing coding, signal processing, networking and communication techniques. The first effort will investigate the NC-based techniques for efficient multimedia delivery from the Internet to receivers in a wireless access network such as Wi-Fi or WiMax. This effort will focus on the optimal integration of NC to the network stack, from media compression techniques at the application layer, to packet schedulers at the link layer, to channel coding and modulation methods at the physical layer, in order to improve quality of wireless multimedia networking applications. The second effort will explore a scalable, NC-based, Peer-to-Peer architecture for multimedia storage and delivery. The focus will be on developing network protocols and NC-based data replenishment techniques to support high quality video streaming. <br\/><br\/>These two efforts will provide an in-depth understanding of when, where, and how to apply NC techniques for multimedia networking applications. The specific research goals are 1) to understand and quantify the effects of the interactions among network layers and NC techniques, 2) to develop theories and methodologies for jointly optimizing NC techniques with the existing infrastructures, and 3) to develop software platforms for enhancing wireless multimedia networking applications, and for building robust, scalable, distributed multimedia storage and streaming systems. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impact. Integral to the research will be efforts to increase enrollment and retention of electrical engineering and computer science students through exciting projects and class materials, to promote inter-community collaborations among researchers in the fields of networking, signal processing, and coding theory through a series of workshops, and to create societal wealth through innovations via industrial collaborations and start-up ventures.","title":"CAREER:Network Coding for Media Transmission and Storage","awardID":"0845476","effectiveDate":"2009-04-15","expirationDate":"2014-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["399757"],"PO":["565090"]},"157386":{"abstract":"OCI 0929541<br\/>Purdue University<br\/>Barbara Fossum<br\/>Abstract<br\/><br\/>This proposal requests funding for a two day International Workshop to be held April 14-15, 2009 at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.

To understand this crisis, many factors have been examined including the image of computing and the pedagogy and materials used in introductory classes. Over time, many instructors have experimented with classes that teach fundamental computing constructs and skills through more attractive applications and environments. There is some anecdotal evidence that this approach is effective and some studies that have been carried out with non-majors. This project presents a unique and timely opportunity to test this approach; in the past, finding viable and significantly large comparison groups to support the hypothesis has been a challenge.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual merit: This EAGER project takes advantage of two existing comparison groups in introductory classes that are being taught the same two semesters at the University of California San Diego, one traditional and one using media computing. Students are surveyed to support the hypothesis that teaching computing through a more attractive domain such as media computing will result in better attitudes toward computing among both majors and students who take computing courses to complement their majors. The existence of two viable and significantly large comparison groups is fortunate and provides results of interest to the computer science education research community. This first round of data, expected to support the hypothesis that motivating context will improve attitudes toward engagement in computing classes and immediate intent of students to continue in computing classes and major, enables future projects that examine effects on more enduring retention.<br\/><br\/>Broader impacts: This lays out a comparative study showing key data that will assist other computing departments in making decisions about curricular change to improve recruitment and retention. Specifically, the attitudes of students taking CS1 with media computation is analyzed and compared to students who are taking a traditional CS1 class absent the hypothesized motivating context. These results are informative to departments that seek an increased number of students applying to their departments, greater numbers of students succeeding in their programs, and overall a student body that is more engaged and positively inclined towards the value of computing in their career and in society.","title":"EAGER: Transforming Attitudes via Best Practices CS1","awardID":"0933635","effectiveDate":"2009-04-15","expirationDate":"2014-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7382","name":"Computing Ed for 21st Century"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1104","name":"Division of UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","abbr":"DUE"},"pgm":{"id":"7494","name":"CCLI-Type 1 (Exploratory)"}}],"PIcoPI":["558312"],"PO":["564181"]},"152382":{"abstract":"The value of social computing environments has been demonstrated in many contexts, including web search, shared bookmarking and photo sharing, personal social networking, online support groups, and information resources such as Wikipedia.

Separator and randomization are basic tools of designing algorithms for many applications problems. A separator is often used to decompose a difficult computational problem into smaller and easier ones, and then to solve the problem with a divide and conquer strategy. Randomization is widely used to speed up computation by sampling a small number of cases from a large number of possibilities. In order to attack challenging computational problems, such as protein 3D structure prediction, more efficient decomposition methods are expected to be developed. This project unifies the two approaches of separators and randomization because of their close connection. This unified approach helps the development of sublinear time algorithms, which are usually based on random sampling. <br\/><br\/>The decomposition methods are studied from low dimensional geometric spaces to high dimensional spaces and to general graphs and to algebraic computation. Proving the existence of a separator will get new insights into combinatorial nature of a given problem. Finding a separator efficiently is also an interesting algorithmic problem itself and often uses randomized methods. On the other hand, the research on complexity theory related to randomness is a part of this project, which includes the research about some lower bounds for randomization methods and the limitation of derandomization. A potential application of separator theory is protein folding prediction. A more efficient decomposition method will bring faster algorithm for this significant problem in science. As this project combines decomposition with randomization, the results of the research make new contributions to the core area of computation theory and discover applications in the field of bioinformatics. Education is an integral part of this project. Minority graduate students and female graduate students are involved in the protein 3D structure related algorithm design and web-server implementation. A randomized computation course for both undergraduate and graduate students is developed.","title":"CAREER: Theories and Applications of Efficient Separator and Randomization","awardID":"0845376","effectiveDate":"2009-04-01","expirationDate":"2014-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7929","name":"COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY"}}],"PIcoPI":["557183"],"PO":["565157"]},"156045":{"abstract":"This is funding to support attendance by approximately 4 senior graduate students and recent PhDs from VR research groups in academia, industry, the military, and government, at the IEEE Virtual Reality 2009 conference, so that they can participate as panelists on a student panel. IEEE VR is the premier international conference and exhibition in virtual reality. It provides a unique forum for interaction among leading experts in VR and closely-related fields such as augmented reality, mixed reality, and 3D user interfaces, who come together to share their work and in turn to be exposed to the latest work from a worldwide contingent of researchers, as well as to renew friendships and make new ones. The IEEE Virtual Reality 2009 conference will be held in Lafayette, Louisiana, on March 14-18, 2009. Virtual Reality is reaching a crossroads, moving from hype-fueled field to one of serious application, evaluation, and study. And those who will transform the field are the senior graduate students and recent graduates in VR research groups and companies across the world. These \"next-gen\" VR pioneers need a stronger voice in the field, and the \"current-gen\" VR researchers and developers need to hear that voice. IEEE VR has a long tradition of strong student participation, with an extensive student volunteer program, fair student conference rates, and strong student interest. However, aside from presenting papers students have had few opportunities to play an active role in the conference. The student panel, which has been accepted for inclusion in the 2009 conference program, will provide a platform for students to participate in forming longer-term visions. This panel will be the third of its kind, following in the footsteps of very successful and well attended predecessors in 2007 and 2008. This year's discussion will focus on two main topics: building a career in VR, and evolving the IEEE VR conference. A moderator will lead the discussion with a focus on involvement by students, but while preference will be given to questions from students in the audience senior researchers will also be encouraged to contribute advice. The PI has committed to being proactive in order to ensure diversity among the panelists, including members of traditionally under-represented groups and women. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The IEEE VR 2009 student panel will provide a unique vehicle for broadening participation by under-represented groups in the conference, while also affording an opportunity for young researchers to network, cultivate ideas, and create a sense of community ownership. The ideas of the future pioneers of the VR field will be of significant interest to all conference attendees. The establishment of this annual series of student panels at the IEEE VR conferences will serve as a model to other conference organizing committees.","title":"Student Panel at IEEE Virtual Reality 2009","awardID":"0923897","effectiveDate":"2009-04-01","expirationDate":"2010-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[416130],"PO":["565227"]}}
