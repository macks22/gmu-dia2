{"162481":{"abstract":"Ongoing breakthroughs in nationally important research areas like Verification and Artificial Intelligence depend on continuing advances in high-performance automated theorem proving tools. The typical use of these tools is as backends: application problems are translated by an application tool into (typically very large and complex) logic formulas, which are then handed off to a logic solver. Different tradeoffs between linguistic expressiveness and the difficulty of solving the resulting problems give rise to different logics. Solver communities, formed around these different logics, have developed their own community research infrastructures to encourage innovation and ease adoption of their solver technology. Such infrastructure includes standard formats for logic formulas, libraries of benchmark formulas, and regular solver competitions to spur solver advances. <br\/><br\/>Currently, these different infrastructures are all developed separately, at significant cost in equipment and support. These costs are paid again and again for the different services, since there is currently no global piece of computing infrastructure suitable for the logic solving domain, which all these communities can use. This project is building a simplified proof-of-concept of a single piece of shared computing infrastructure, which could eventually be used by many different logic solver communities. The award also provides other support for soliciting research community feedback on the prototype and the design of a comprehensive infrastructure.","title":"Collaborative Research: CI-ADDO-NEW: *-EXEC: A Cross-Community Solver Execution Service","awardID":"0957438","effectiveDate":"2010-05-01","expirationDate":"2012-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7359","name":"COMPUTING RES INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["471910"],"PO":["491702"]},"168960":{"abstract":"This proposal requests funding to assist approximately 6 US-based graduate students and junior faculty to attend the 19th annual New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW) to be held in Concord, MA, in September 2010.

The system is structured for a variety of uses. Standard MPI computation is carried out with a tightly coupled cluster of quad core processors, while 'fat nodes' with 256 GB of RAM as well as local high speed disk storage service jobs that require large shared memory. Researchers actively developing codes can take advantage of the unique performance characteristics of GPU (graphics processing) nodes. The system will have several NVidia Tesla nodes.<br\/>The users of the system are drawn from all five departments of the College of Engineering (Chemical Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical & Computer Engineering, Materials, and Mechanical Engineering), seven departments of the Division of Mathematical, Life and Physical Sciences (Chemistry & Biochemistry, Earth Science, Ecology Evolution & Marine Biology, Mathematics, Molecular Cellular & Developmental Biology, Physics, and Psychology), as well as the departments of Economics, Geography, and Media Arts & Technology from the Division of Humanities and Social Sciences. In addition, the system supports research in eight campus centers: Allosphere Research Facility, the California NanoSystems Institute, the Center for Polymers and Organic Solids, the Institute for Crustal Studies, the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, the Materials Research Laboratory, the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis, and the Neuroscience Research Institute.<br\/>The new system will be housed in the same location as the previous one where the same successful administrative and maintenance procedures used for the past six years will be applied. The proposed cluster will be accessible via the UC Grid, a web portal interface that makes high performance computing resources easy to use from desktop machines (PCs or Macs). The acquired system will come with a three-year warranty. Prior experience has shown that only a small number of nodes are expected to malfunction during the useful lifetime (> 3 years) of the cluster. <br\/>Broader Impacts: <br\/>The research enabled by the campus-wide facility, interdisciplinary and collaborative in nature, is available to the broad research community. The large majority of users, roughly 75%, consists of postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates (5%), allowing this award to accomplish NSF's longstanding goal of integrating research and education. Outreach to K-12 takes place via a new initiative, The School for Scientific Thought (SST), an extension to the Let's Explore Physical Sciences (LEAPS) Program. Under the SST Program UCSB science and engineering graduate students design and teach a course for an audience of high school students on Saturdays. In addition, many of the faculty associated with this proposal participate in the UC Leadership Excellence through the Advanced Degrees program that has increased the number of underrepresented students in science and engineering at UCSB.","title":"MRI-R2: Acquisition of a high performance central computing facility at UCSB","awardID":"0960316","effectiveDate":"2010-05-01","expirationDate":"2013-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1189","name":"MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION"}}],"PIcoPI":[436116,436117,"504404","560826","517721"],"PO":["557609"]},"169521":{"abstract":"The NAACL HLT conference is the major international conference in North America in the field of natural language processing.

These two AUVs add capability to those already in use by CINAPS. The work addresses two current key limitations: limited depth (depth no greater than 200m) and limited communication (only supports communication through the air, i.e., when the vehicles are not below the surface.) These instruments impact agendas in two main fields: research in the Southern California coastal marine ecosystem (in physical oceanography, geobiological oceanography, and microbial ecology), and research in robotics, communication, and networking.<br\/>The instrumentation consists of a Slocum Electric Glider and an EcoMapper-EP (Expandable Payload) Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. The Slocum glider, for use up to 1000m, was developed by in the early 1990's, and has become an integral tool of ocean science in this decade. It is driven entirely by a variable buoyancy system rather than active propulsion. The glider's wings convert the buoyancy-dependent vertical motion into forward velocity. Slocum gliders are truly autonomous, requiring a surface vessel only for deployment and recovery. On-board communications capabilities include a two-way RF modem, Iridium satellite and an ARGOS locator. With its onboard instrumentation, combined with its mobility and long-range capabilities, the glider provides continuous, near-real-time information, about the physics and biogeochemistry of the ocean. Designed specifically for water quality and bathymetry mapping applications, the Ecomapper for shallow use (up to 200m) is a unique AUV. Easily deployed by one person, it is able to perform a wide-area survey without a surface workboat or associated personnel. The EP class EcoMapper allows for additional ports for customized sensor integration and space for a second low-power CPU to support the additional sensors and software. This additional CPU enables mission adaptations to occur on-the-fly based on real-time sensor readings that are necessary when trying to detect and track dynamically changing oceanic features a range of important processes and associated questions can only be studied with the coupling of deep AUV operations (up to 1000m) with shallow (up to 200m). These include (a) the toxic effect of harmful algal blooms at greater depth, (b) the temporal and spatial variations of the low oxygen interface (deep basins can become hypoxic or anoxic due to isolation), and (c) fluxes of particulate material from urban runoff to the deeper sea that are discontinuous in both time and space; the spatial extent of which can be best resolved with autonomous vehicles that can maintain a presence over several events. To enable these studies, new algorithms for multi-AUV communication and control are necessary. The ability to coordinate vehicle trajectories and missions while submerged presents a current limitation. This is of particular concern in the Southern California Bight, the study site, a region with high maritime traffic where surfacing of the AUVs needs to be minimized. Used as a field instrument deployed in the Southern California Bight (SCB), the instrument is programmed and bench-tested in the Robotic Embedded Systems Laboratory on the USC main campus in LA.

Today, between 40 and 56 million people in the United States report some type of disability, and this number will likely grow in the coming years as the baby boom generation enters late life. RESNA (formerly the Rehabilitation Engineering Society of North America) is the one organization with an international focus that is devoted solely to technology for individuals with disabilities. RESNA's membership consists of individuals and institutions covering a range of disciplines (including researchers, clinicians, suppliers, manufacturers, consumers and educators who work in non-profit and for-profit settings), all of whom are dedicated to promoting the exchange of ideas and information for the advancement of assistive technology. In addition to its annual conference, RESNA conducts a credentialing program for assistive technology practitioners, rehabilitation engineering technologists and suppliers, as well as sponsored projects. RESNA's Technical Standards Board is the U.S. Technical Advisory Group to ANSI, the official U.S. representative to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), for the development of ISO standards pertaining to assistive technology and other products for persons with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>The RESNA Student Design Competition fosters innovation and creativity with the ultimate goal of producing technology that can contribute to the independence of individuals with disabilities. The first SDC was held in 1980 as part of the inaugural RESNA conference. Since then, over 200 designs have been identified as winning entries, chosen from more than 600 submissions by students from over 115 different universities. SDC entries are required to represent the work of students ONLY, including the design documentation; both undergraduates and graduates are eligible to take part. Many past participants in the event are now leaders in service, research, and educational areas related to technology for people with disabilities. Some past student designs have been patented and are now available commercially. NSF has been a supporter since 2005. This year's funding will enable the SDC to be further expanded and enhanced, so as to include more entries and support for more design teams, especially from minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities. A call for participation has been posted on the conference website, and also distributed electronically to a large number of colleges and universities with engineering and design schools. A team of 5 judges will pre-select entries from up to 10 teams, from which two members each will be invited to attend the conference supported with travel and hotel funds as well as complimentary registration. During a half-day session in which the teams will make presentations before the judges and public audience at the conference, 5 teams will ultimately be selected as the final winners. Judges will have an opportunity to ask questions and make suggestions and recommendations to the design teams. A platform session will be held in which the 5 finalists will make presentations to the general conference attendees. All SDC teams invited to the conference will have an opportunity to present their projects in a poster session during the general conference time. More information is available online at http:\/\/www.resna.org\/conference.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The annual RESNA Conference and the Student Design Competition combine to create a forum for interaction between working and experienced rehabilitation engineers and students who are about to enter the field. Unique in its primary focus on undergraduates, the event provides participants with experience and skills that help them succeed in their engineering and design careers. It further encourages and mentors students in various disciplines to become involved in the assistive technology and rehabilitation engineering fields, and also provides an opportunity for the students to network with their peers and rehabilitation engineers, many of whom participated in previous SDC competitions. In an effort to increase the diversity of submissions to the SDC in future years, this year's participants will build web pages to illustrate their design and design process. Not only will young scientists benefit from this medium of dissemination but professors and those who teach will also be able to share this information with their students as examples of projects that others have done. The content of all submissions, not just the finalists, will be captured and accessed through the RESNA website. The information will be searchable through the National Public Internet Site on assistivetech.net and the ATWiki.

This flexible hardware\/software boundary increases the complexity of software development that is eased via sophisticated development tool support and an extensive software component library that the project is also developing. The small inexpensive platform offers two orders of magnitude higher performance than current microcontroller-based hardware at equivalent power for many applications.

The Internet Protocol (IP) is one mechanism for achieving such an abstraction. By making the choice for a rudimentary \"best-effort\" service, the Internet has not been able to effectively respond to new requirements (security, manageability, wireless, mobility, and so forth.) The rigid structure of the current IP model has led to numerous ad hoc solutions that are either inefficient or incomplete.<br\/><br\/>This project is aimed at developing a clean-slate Recursive Internet Architecture(RINA) that is based on the fundamental principle that networking is inter-process communication (IPC). In this model, application processes(APes) communicate via a distributed IPC facility. The IPC processes that make up this facility provide a protocol that implements an IPC mechanism, and a protocol for managing distributed IPC (routing, security and other management tasks). RINA views each IPC facility as a \"private\" network, thus it offers intrinsic security features. And it is recursive in that the IPC processes can themselves be APes requesting services from lower IPC facilities. This project will design and develop the repeating structures of RINA, along with various policies seen useful in support of security, multihoming, mobility, and manageability. The developed IPC mechanisms build upon recursive naming and addressing of IPC processes, separation of mechanism and policy, and isolating data transfer, control and management.

With e-crimes resulting from such information being compromised to unauthorized parties at an all time high, the ?all wireless? vision can truly materialize only if the security of wireless information transfer can be guaranteed. Conventional approaches to information security are designed for wired networks with assumptions that lead to a disassociation from the physical medium in which communication takes place, and provide guarantees against adversaries that are computationally limited. This project provides a new approach for wireless networks to deliver provable and unconditional security. <br\/><br\/>This research designs wireless networks with a secure foundation guaranteeing reliable and secure delivery of information. In doing so, the investigators account for untapped and rich resources provided by wireless systems naturally, including sources with correlated observations or application content, channels that provide spatial and temporal diversity, network nodes that are helpers or relays providing interaction, and broadcast and bi-directional nature of the medium enabling communication with feedback. The project calls for a network design paradigm that has security in its foundation and provides enlightened system design principles and protocols that are optimized to jointly exploit these resources. Some examples of this, which form the intellectual backbone of this project, include the optimal use of correlated sources and broadcast channels, the role of multinode interaction, the opportunistic use of potentially untrusted relay nodes, the creative use of feedback channels, in order to render intelligent and computationally unlimited (passive and active) adversaries ineffective.

Special emphasis will be given to minority students not traditionally well represented at SDM conferences.<br\/><br\/>Participation in premier research conferences such as SDM is an integral component of the training of Ph.D. students in data mining. The SDM 2010 Ph.D. Student Forum will provide an opportunity for Ph.D. candidates to present their work and receive constructive feedback and mentoring from established researchers in data mining. Such feedback and mentoring is expected to improve the quality of the students thesis research. Similarly, students recipient of a travel award will be able to attend technical sessions, plenary talks, panels, tutorials and workshops. They will interact with peers who share similar interests from other universities, as well as hundreds of leading researchers in data mining from around the world. This experience will be extremely formative and fruitful towards the shaping of their future research endeavors. <br\/><br\/>Data mining is playing an increasingly important role in many emerging data-rich sciences and application domains, such as bioinformatics, computational biology, link analysis, counter-terrorism, and security. The SDM 2010 Ph.D. student forum will enrich the education and training of student researchers at early stages in their careers. The attendance of SDM 2010 will expose students to cutting-edge research and to relevant applications in a variety of domains. Both the student forum and travel awards will also help broaden the representation of women and members of underrepresented minority groups within the Data Mining research community.","title":"Doctoral Student Forum and Student Travel at the 2010 SIAM Data Mining Conference; Columbus, Ohio","awardID":"1010857","effectiveDate":"2010-05-01","expirationDate":"2012-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["521348"],"PO":["563751"]},"163764":{"abstract":"The wide use of wireless data services leads to sensitive and confidential information delivered over wireless links.

A central challenge in the transition to parallelism is shortage of workforce with expertise in parallel programming. In this REU, we will train students in the basics of parallel programming, provide them with research experience that demonstrates the importance of parallel computing in their own fields, and help them develop the confidence that they need to be successful in graduate school.<br\/><br\/>To enable undergraduates to participate in the revolutionary new capabilities afforded by parallel computing, the REU-POP program (Research Experience for Undergraduates-Passionate on Parallel) at the University of Illinois will recruit ten (10) junior- and senior-level undergraduates majoring in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines to participate in a summer research experience in parallel computing and programming relevant to their own fields of study. Recognizing that women are critically underrepresented in academic and professional computer science, qualified students will be especially sought at women's and minority-serving colleges with limited research or graduate-school options. Eligible students will have completed specified computer science courses, but will not be required to have experience in parallel programming, which is rarely available at the undergraduate level.<br\/><br\/>REU students will work in pairs (current literature suggests this is a successful learning strategy for women in programming) in small teams that will include a faculty member in their own discipline and a specially trained graduate mentor. Through preparatory online sessions before the POP summer, a four-day immersion session at the start of the POP summer, hands-on learning in their university laboratory, weekly technical sessions, and special seminars on topics such as parallel computing in current technology; research ethics; technology commercialization; and the benefits of graduate school, students will develop essential skills in parallel programming and explore the research options in their own STEM disciplines. Students will also interact with prominent professional and academic researchers to form a network of diverse role models and mentors to provide advice on careers and graduate school options.<br\/><br\/>We believe undergraduates can be encouraged to persist in engineering programs, particularly computer science, by engaging them in research, by employing multiple mentoring options, and by providing opportunities for them to work in \"programming pairs.\" The REU-POP program at Illinois will explore these methods within the REU context, and we will report on their success in the open literature to assist others in this effort.<br\/><br\/>This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.","title":"REU Site: Passionate on Parallel-A Summer Research Program for Women in STEM","awardID":"1004311","effectiveDate":"2010-05-01","expirationDate":"2014-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1139","name":"RSCH EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD SITES"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1100","name":"Division of A\/D FUND","abbr":"A\/D"},"pgm":{"id":"J103","name":"AIRFORCE"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1100","name":"Division of A\/D FUND","abbr":"A\/D"},"pgm":{"id":"J243","name":"Air Force Office of Scientific"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1100","name":"Division of A\/D FUND","abbr":"A\/D"},"pgm":{"id":"K629","name":"Air Force Office of Scientific"}}],"PIcoPI":["539055","492285"],"PO":["564588"]},"164535":{"abstract":"IIS - 0968647 <br\/>Automatic Indexing of Polyphonic Music by Cascade Classifiers<br\/>Ras, Zbigniew W. <br\/>University of North Carolina at Charlotte<br\/><br\/>Abstract<br\/><br\/>The goal of this EAGER project is to support exploratory work on a new class of cascade classifiers and hybrid classifiers for automatic indexing of polyphonic music according to instruments and types of instruments.

Second, this work analyzes mutual interaction among layers in a BIA-based network. The PIs carry out an analysis of mutual interaction among layers in BIA-based networks. This includes a) analysis of interaction among layered SO-based control and b) establishment of a fundamental theory of layered architecture. Third, this work analyzes BIA-based control in wireless networks. Here the PIs conduct analyses of BIA-based control on wireless networks, to a) determine implementation issues of BIA-based control on real systems and b) perform a practical evaluation and analysis of BIA-based control through simulation and testbed implementation.

To achieve the goal of synthesis of speaker identity from a small training corpus the project will address problems including trainable abstract parameterizations of the prosodic patterns that characterize a speaker and voice conversion methods. The project falls into the general category of building Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis system in order to generate speech that sounds like that of a specific individual (Speaker Identity Synthesis, or SIS). Systems of this kind have numerous applications, including the creation of personalized voices for individuals with neurodegenerative disorders who anticipate becoming users of Speech Generating Devices (Sods) in the future and many other applications in the consumer products and entertainment industry. Consumer products such as navigation systems and mobile phones are rapidly being developed that make use of linguistic information about generated utterance. The project will also provide new tools and data for human perception of speaker identity. The tools developed in the process and the associated perceptual studies are also relevant for assessment of speaker recognition systems, and the project provides a new generation of concise, trainable characterizations of a speaker?s prosodic patterns that can be incorporated in these systems. The proposed study will elucidate the trade-offs and algorithm issues of the proposed SIS systems and it is likely that the proposed work will have a strong intellectual impact in the field of speech synthesis.","title":"HCC: Medium: Synthesis and Perception of Speaker Identity","awardID":"0964468","effectiveDate":"2010-05-15","expirationDate":"2014-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":[438630,438631,"483791"],"PO":["564456"]},"162885":{"abstract":"\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\" <br\/>Proposal #: 09-59441<br\/>PI(s): Wills, Craig <br\/> Claypool, Mark L.; Doyle, James K.; Ward, Mathew O.<br\/>Institution: Worcester Polytechnic Institute <br\/>Title: MRI\/Acq.: Dev. of a User-Centered Network Measurement Platform<br\/>Project Proposed:<br\/>This project, developing a network measurement approach centered on where users live and on their specific interactions with the Internet, supports a wide range of research projects. The instrumentation provides a means to test applicable techniques from research projects on a large scale through vetted experiments and will be accessible to all users via two integrated measurement approaches that<br\/>- Execute within the protected sandbox of a user Web browser to provide low impediments encouraging broad user participation while still yielding useful Internet data.<br\/>- Perform more extensive application-oriented performance tests from a user's machine and is not constrained by the sandbox.<br\/>The former makes use of entertainment applications in the form of games and videos to help engage users and increase participation. The application-oriented nature of the latter tests yields performance data that can be uploaded for sharing among network researchers while providing feedback to users on network applications of interest. This feedback serves as an incentive for user participation. Thus, the platform provides information about the network applications that interest home users and conditions in which these applications operate. Researchers can use the platform tests from their own measurement points (MPs) and then calibrate the characteristics of their MPs with others. The entertainment orientation of the sandboxed platform serves provides an environment to decide how best to employ the use of videos and games for measurement. The open research area offers a training opportunity for students.<br\/>Broader Impacts: <br\/>This project promotes teaching and training through integration with systems courses and the Interactive Media and Games Development (IMGD) program. The work also aims to broaden participation in science and engineering by underrepresented groups through IMGD.

The objective of this program is to provide a diverse pool of motivated undergraduate students with a competitive research experience in IAS. Specifically, the proposed REU site will offer an nine-week summer program for nine undergraduate students each year to develop confidence as researchers and scientists. To assure the diversity of participants, the site will select up to 40% of the students from DSU (a primarily undergraduate institution) and at least 60% from other academic institutions in the Upper Midwest and across the nation. The recruiting effort will focus on students from underrepresented groups and academic institutions with limited research opportunities or without IAS programs. During the nine-week program, each student will work with a faculty mentor at DSU on a carefully designed research project. In the first few weeks, students will focus on developing projects. A series of tutorials and workshops will be provided to help students establish necessary background knowledge and learn about how to conduct scientific research in IAS. Students will also work with their individual advisors, read literature, and design their projects. For the remaining weeks, students will carry out their projects under the supervision of their mentors. They will also attend the weekly seminars by faculty and invited industry speakers and report their weekly progress. In the last week, students will prepare a written report and an oral presentation. <br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: IAS is a field of national priority. Recent security incidents indicate that many organizations such as banks have not adequately responded to the IAS issues. The project provides undergraduate students with a competitive research experience in this important field. They will tackle a variety of significant IAS problems, ranging from secure design and verification, security testing, to forensics of security incidents. This will have an important impact on the defense in-depth of information systems such as online banking applications. A unique feature of this project is the integration of the fundamental IAS problems into an important application domain (i.e., banking and finance).<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This project will allow a diverse pool of motivated students from underrepresented groups and universities with limited research opportunities to gain research experiences in IAS. It builds upon an existing partnership with a consortium of schools in the Upper Midwest. It will strengthen the partnership by providing their students with a competitive research experience which would otherwise be unavailable. The recruitment process will capitalize on minority institutions that have established connections with DSU, specifically the Oglala-Lakota College in South Dakota and Florida International University. The REU program provides valuable skills that will help participants integrate their research experiences with their ongoing classroom instruction. The process of learning how to do research, write up and present their research results will better prepare them for their future field of study and motivate them to pursue graduate studies.","title":"REU Site: Information Assurance and Security","awardID":"1004843","effectiveDate":"2010-05-01","expirationDate":"2014-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1139","name":"RSCH EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD SITES"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":["564245","531638","489025"],"PO":["564181"]},"163458":{"abstract":"The International Research Instrumentation System (IRIS) is a proposal to provide a software framework to simplify the task of end-to-end network performance monitoring and diagnostics and thereby improve support for international science and engineering collaborations.

Conventional pipeline inefficiencies include unnecessary accesses to the register file due to duplication or avoidable computation from constantly checking for forwarding and hazards at points where they cannot possibly occur, repeated calculation of invariant values, etc. It is desirable to develop an alternative processor design that can avoid these wasteful energy consumption aspects of a traditionally pipelined processor while still achieving comparable performance.<br\/><br\/>A statically pipelined processor is expected to achieve these goals by having the control during each cycle for each portion of the processor explicitly represented in each instruction.

However, microcontrollers have limited computational power and hence, restrict the kinds of algorithms that can be implemented. Moreover, closed radio architectures prevent the direct access to the physical layer needed for many novel applications. The emergence of low-power FPGAs with their efficient duty cycling support presents an opportunity to create a novel wireless platform to overcome these limitations. The project develops a highly flexible hardware\/software architecture for mobile wireless networking based on low-power FPGA devices. High performance DSP and other algorithms can be implemented directly in hardware, while the rest of the code runs on a soft processor core inside the FPGA. This flexible hardware\/software boundary increases the complexity of software development that is eased via sophisticated development tool support and an extensive software component library that the project is also developing.

Unfortunately, providing multiple cores does not translate into performance for most applications. Rather than pushing all the burden onto programmers, this project advocates the use of the implicitly parallel programming model to eliminate the laborious and error-prone process of explicit parallel programming. Implicit parallel programming leverages sequential languages to facilitate shorter development and debug cycles, and relies on automatic tools, both static compilers and run-time systems, to identify parallelism and customize it to the target platform. Implicit parallelism can be systematically extracted using: (1) decoupled softwarepipelining, a technique to extract the pipeline parallelism found in many sequential applications; (2) low-frequency and high-confidence speculation to overcome limitations of memory dependence analysis; (3) whole-program scope for parallelization to eliminate analysis boundaries; (4) simple extensions to the sequential programming model that give the programmer the power to refine the meaning of a program; (5) dynamic adaptation to ensure efficiency is maintained across changing environments. This project is developing the set of technologies to realize an implicitly parallel programming system with scalable, lifelong thread extraction and dynamic adaptation. At the broader level, the implicitly parallel programming approach will free programmers to consider the problems they are trying to solve, rather than forcing them to overcome the processor industry's failure to continue to scale performance. This approach will keep computers accessible, helping computing to have the same increasingly positive impact on other fields.","title":"CSR: Medium: Collaborative Research: Scaling the Implicitly Parallel Programming Model with Lifelong Thread Extraction and Dynamic Adaptation","awardID":"0964627","effectiveDate":"2010-05-01","expirationDate":"2014-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":[438733,438734],"PO":["565255"]},"162801":{"abstract":"\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\" <br\/>Proposal #: 09-59053<br\/>PI(s): Johnson, Andrew E.; Brown, Maxine, Leigh, Jason, Peterka, Tom<br\/>Institution: University of Illinois - Chicago <br\/>Title: MRI\/Dev.: Dev. of the Next Generation CAVE Virtual Environment (NG-CAVE)<br\/>Project Proposed:<br\/>This project, developing the Next Generation CAVE (NG-CAVE), supports 15 research projects from local institutions.

It provides users with the ability to see 3D content at nearly 106 Megapixels.<br\/>For the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the institution, NG-CAVE represents the culmination of decades of experience and expertise developing immersive environments, from the room-sized CAVE virtual environment in 1992, to the office-sized ImmersaDesk in 1994, to the GeoWall in 2000, and the more recent ultra-high-resolution LamdaVision tiled-display wall and autostereoscopic Varrier-tiled-display wall. Each new generation of visualization instrumentation has provided scientific communities with one or more advanced features (higher resolution, unencumbered stereoscopic viewing, multi-Gigabit connectivity, and intuitive user interfaces), better coupling worldwide scientific virtual organizations, and better integrating scientific workplaces with globally distributed cyberinfrastructure.<br\/>NG-CAVE provides an alternative approach to constructing CAVEs by using new near-seamless flat LCD technology augmented with micropolarization, rather than traditional projection technologies. The net effect is a new CAVE that has 3D acuity to match human vision, can be scaled near-seamless to even greater resolution, is affordable compared to projection-based approaches, requires little maintenance, can be used for both 2D and 3D stereoscopic viewing, and can support multiple simultaneous viewers.

This research will provide fundamental knowledge of how core inter-dependencies both complicate and reveal new optimization opportunities and self-tuning methodologies applicable to other system components (e.g. communication topologies and protocols, voltage scaling, task-to-core mapping, etc.). The outcomes will spawn future research endeavors and enhance academic curricula as well as impact society through more rapidly advancing state-of-the-art technology made possible by reducing design time burdens, enabling application designers to focus more heavily on enhanced functionality rather than system optimization. A research group composed largely of underrepresented minorities and women will undertake the project's endeavors. In addition, the project will include an in-depth evaluation of real-life experiences gathered from successful women engineers to provide tangible motivation, which will be disseminated through scholarly publications, summer research experience programs for high school students, as well as seminars for K-12 students, teachers, and parents.","title":"CAREER: A Self-Tuning Cache Architecture for Multi-Core Systems","awardID":"0953447","effectiveDate":"2010-05-01","expirationDate":"2015-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["507807"],"PO":["565255"]},"170358":{"abstract":"This project supports US student researchers to travel to the Doctoral Consortium and the premier international conference on autonomous agents and multiagent systems.

It will design, prototype, and evaluate a community-oriented peer-to-peer infrastructure that exploits social knowledge for services such as data and computing management, while protecting social data privacy seen as contextual integrity. Using social knowledge in the design of services will likely improve performance, based on the assumptions that social incentives reduce churn; socially-inferred trust reduce security breaches and expand the set of available resources; and shared interest improves data placement decisions or co-location of data and computations. This will create the potential to enable new classes of applications and infrastructures. <br\/><br\/>This project develops innovative teaching strategies that facilitate non CS-major students use of computational tools in their professional lives.

This has to be done in such a way that performance improvements are guaranteed. Otherwise the escalating costs of fabrication at the nanometer scale will not be sustainable. Multiple core microprocessors face several major problems, not the least of which is codified in Amdahl?s Law. This law states that even if multiple core processors can reduce all parallelizable code to vanishingly small run time, what will remain is serial code. Even relatively small amounts of serial code then limit the gains possible. Consequently it is prudent to pursue a balanced technology approach, in which both parallelizable and serial codes enjoy advantages. For serial code, assuming all instruction level parallelism (ILP) is fully exploited, the only way forward is to execute the serial code on a higher clock rate unit, or HCRU. Since clock rates for CMOS have tended to saturate due to wire scaling problems and excessive heat dissipation, one must look to an alternate three terminal device, but which is compatible with CMOS. This project explores whether the solution lies with an overlooked device, an aggressively scaled SiGe Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor (HBT). The claim for the research to verify is that clock rates of 20-30 GHz are possible at reasonable power levels and densities, but 3D technology is needed to mitigate memory wall problems.","title":"EAGER: A 32 GHz RISC Computer using 3D and SiGe Emerging Technology","awardID":"1031440","effectiveDate":"2010-05-01","expirationDate":"2012-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7941","name":"COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7945","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYST"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["517103"],"PO":["535244"]},"163857":{"abstract":"The microprocessor industry has moved toward multicore designs to leverage increasing transistor counts in the face of physical and micro-architectural limitations.

The prevailing approach to create such machines is to copy physiological and neurological systems observed in animals, and build them into robots. This raises the issue however of what from among the infinitude of existing biological structures should be copied. Research under this award is pursuing an alternative approach: rather than copy existing biological systems, evolutionary dynamics are copied and connected in a virtual space. The resulting evolutionary algorithm optimize virtual robots' neurological structures that control behavior and their body plans. Importantly, evolution in these studies is task and behavior specific.<br\/><br\/>The research is intended to make important contributions to robotics and biology. For roboticists, this work will enable computers to automatically design the body plans and neural controllers for robots that are more adaptive and robust than robots designed manually. Automatically-designed virtual robots can then be built as physical devices and deployed into real-world environments, to include those that are dangerous to humans. For biologists, our studies will provide insight into why and how particular structures evolved in nature. For example, if legged robots originally evolved for locomotion are then selected to locomote and grasp objects, computational evolution may re-purpose the robot's front legs into arms and grippers; or, it may add manipulatory appendages onto the existing body plan. Either outcome would be of great interest to evolutionary biologists.<br\/><br\/>Finally, experiments are being housed in online tools that will allow graduate, undergraduate and K-12 students to run evolutionary simulations passively on their own machines, as well as actively participate in the process: they may design novel virtual environments in which the robots must evolve. This active participation is intended to motivate students to understand the physics, biology, engineering and computational processes underlying evolution.","title":"CAREER: Investigating the Ultimate Mechanisms of Embodied Cognition","awardID":"0953837","effectiveDate":"2010-05-15","expirationDate":"2015-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["560697"],"PO":["564318"]},"162967":{"abstract":"\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\"<br\/>Proposal #: 09-59958<br\/>PI(s): Bhattacharya, Sambit; Almeida, Michael; Czejdo, Bogdan, D.; Montoya, Daniel<br\/>Institution: Fayetteville State University <br\/>Title: MRI-R2: Acq. of Robots and Robot Accessories for Interdisciplinary Faculty and Student Research<br\/>Project Proposed:<br\/>This project, acquiring four research grade robot platforms along with accessories required for navigation, robot vision, and robot-human interaction within a hybrid architecture, enables research in mobile reactive and hybrid robots. It also forms the basis of a robotics laboratory for conducting such research.<br\/>The work addresses research in the following areas: spatial and temporal representation and reasoning using cognitive maps, stereo vision and object recognition, rapid modification and testing for correctness of reactive behaviors, and human experience of embodiment using robots. Although the institution currently utilizes educational robots in teaching activities, a robot platform suitable for human-robot interaction research is needed. Currently, no advanced robotics research facility exists at FSU or other local universities.<br\/>The acquisition of this equipment for a Robotics Lab strengthens interdisciplinary collaboration between the Departments of Psychology and Mathematics and Computer Science. Students in Psychology benefit from learning about computer hardware components and programming algorithms, while students in Computer Science learn about and work with concepts of cognitive psychology. A room within the science building at FSU is currently being refurbished to conduct the research projects described in this proposal, and store the robots. The PI and a co-PIs are responsible for installation of the robots at FSU. Most accessory and software installation in the robot bases will mainly be done by the vendor before shipping, so very little time and effort will be required to get started using the robots.

A long term maintenance contract from the vendor is included as part of the proposal.<br\/>Broader Impacts: <br\/>The equipment enables research activities involving undergraduate and graduate students, contributing to train them in advanced scientific research methodology and application development. This training benefits students from segments of population who are traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines since FSU is a minority serving institution. The existing facilities at FSU are adequate for introductory programming and behavior based robotics courses. This new equipment and the space committed by the university to support the project enables advanced research and training. The activities supported by the equipment strengthen research at FSU.

Multiprocess routing is particularly appropriate for multihomed networks where each network has multiple providers and potentially can be reached with node\/edge disjoint paths. A hierarchical automatic addressing scheme is being incorporated in the context of multiprocess routing. The hierarchical automatic addressing scheme provides multihomed networks with multiple addresses, each of which are allocated within the address block of its provider. This address allocation scheme can effectively reduce routing table size and routing update messages since providers can aggregate their customers? addresses and announce the whole address block rather than the specific address block for each customer. Furthermore, the automatic addressing protocol used here for host addressing can ease the management of multiple addresses for each network host.

Thus, it is highly desired<br\/>that the future Internet is designed to provide a secure<br\/>service domain that is both network-centric and user-centric.<br\/>As a fundamental core to this goal, a secure and resilient<br\/>virtualized routing architecture in a global inter-networking<br\/>environment is explored to provide network resource reservation<br\/>protection both at the network-centric and the user-centric<br\/>level. A novel attribute-based, cryptography-based approach to<br\/>construct secure virtualization is to be developed.<br\/>Furthermore, an architectural solution to address the policy<br\/>enforcement and inter-domain trust management is also<br\/>considered. The end goal is to greatly improve the efficiency<br\/>of attack monitoring and intrusion detection and to increase<br\/>the resiliency of the future Internet. This is a collaborative<br\/>exploratory project bringing together researchers from the<br\/>University of Missouri-Kansas City, Arizona State University,<br\/>and Osaka City University, Japan. All research results will be<br\/>made available to the scientific community.","title":"EAGER: Collaborative Research: A Secure and Resilient Virtual Trust Routing Framework for Future Internet","awardID":"1029562","effectiveDate":"2010-05-01","expirationDate":"2013-10-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["541801"],"PO":["564993"]},"161914":{"abstract":"Human beings can recognize objects in a highly selective, robust and fast manner. One of the remarkable properties of our recognition machinery is the possibility to selectively recognize objects even after transformations such as rotation, translation, scaling, occlusion and clutter. How the human brain accomplishes recognition is not well understood. More is known about processing of sensory information from receptors to the initial stages in cortex than about the subsequent transformation of perceptual data into cognition. In parallel, over the last decades, major progress has been made in building ever more accurate and sophisticated computers and devices to capture sensory information but progress has been slower in terms of developing algorithms and hardware to automatically interpret the sensory data. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Gabriel Krieman is undertaking research whose aim is to elucidate the computational steps and algorithms implemented by the cerebral cortex to transform incoming inputs into cognitive functions and behavior. The research focuses on one particular aspect of cognitive experience, the neuronal mechanisms and circuits that underlie visual processing. While vision is only one of many aspects of cognition, lessons learnt from studying visual cortex can also eventually help describe other aspects of cortical function and can pave the way for research on other challenging aspects of cognition. To investigate visual cognition, Dr. Kreiman takes advantage of a rare opportunity to both stimulate and record electrical activity at high spatial and temporal resolution directly from the human brain in epilepsy patients. The study investigates tasks where visual cognition is dissociated from the incoming sensory processing in order to isolate the cognitive operations involved in recognition. The discoveries about the function of biological neural circuits will be applied to develop biophysically-inspired robust machine vision algorithms. <br\/><br\/>Visual recognition is essential for most everyday tasks including navigating, reading, and identifying objects, faces and emotions. By furthering our understanding of the transformation of perceptual information into cognition, the study is contributing to two broad goals: (1) Helping to alleviate the challenging conditions that involve cognitive disorders through the development of brain-machine interfaces; and (2) Applying knowledge about neuronal circuits to develop computational algorithms to extract cognitive information from sensory data. Building a fast, robust and reliable artificial vision system would have profound repercussions in many areas of science and engineering including pattern recognition, surveillance and security, automatic navigation, clinical image analysis and others. These scientific and engineering advances could in turn translate into important real-world applications of interest for industrial partnerships. Dr. Kreiman pursues these goals by studying the best possible system that can solve visual recognition challenges, the human brain. Understanding the visual system relies on many skills ranging from computer science to engineering to physics to neuroscience to psychology. The project serves well to train a generation of multidisciplinary students who can build on the fundamental science knowledge and apply this knowledge to challenging biological problems.","title":"CAREER:Deciphering the Neural Code From Perception To Cognition","awardID":"0954570","effectiveDate":"2010-05-15","expirationDate":"2015-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0404","name":"Division of BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE SCI","abbr":"BCS"},"pgm":{"id":"1699","name":"COGNEURO"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["447585"],"PO":["562348"]},"162948":{"abstract":"\"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).\" <br\/>Proposal #: 09-59856<br\/>PI(s): Starr, Francis W.; Beveridge, David, L.; Weir, Michael, P.<br\/>Institution: Wesleyan University <br\/>Title: MRI-R2\/Acq: Shared Cluster and Database Computing Facilities at Wesleyan University<br\/>Project Proposed:<br\/>This project, acquiring a shared, state-of-the-art, mid-sized super-computing cluster and database server, supports intensive research computing and corresponding initiatives at the institution. The current central facilities are no longer able to meet the intensive research computing and corresponding initiatives in education, as evidenced by a five-fold increase in the number of pending jobs over a period of two years. The requested cluster roughly doubles the size of the central super-computing facility, as well as adds new support for informatics-based research that relies heavily on relational database mining.<br\/>Research programs in astrophysics, biomaterials, liquid state chemical physics, nanotechnology, quantum chemistry, molecular biophysics, neuroinformatics, and structural bioinformatics, all require high-end computing resources and have become increasingly dependent on high-performance computing facilities. All these areas offer courses that involve hands-on computation. Currently, a large number of faculty, staff and students are active research users, and roughly 2\/3 of those are students; additionally, 40-50 students per year make use of facilities for course related computational activities.<br\/>Based on consultations with the current primary users of the system and the systems administrator, the new proposed cluster consists of 40-50 CPU nodes, each with two Intel Xeon quad core processors, and containing 8-16 GB of storage. An infiniband interconnect will connect the processors to facilitate parallel applications. Data storage is provided for the user calculations via a RAID array of 30-40 TB. The dedicated database server has dual 4 or 6-core processors, a large memory footprint, and high performance local disks to store the database.<br\/>The system is housed in the renovated facility on the Information Technology Services (ITS) floor of the Wesleyan Science Tower, maintained by a designated ITS systems manager and made available for research and instructional needs over the current WESNET network.

To further extend the educational and training goals, a new Scientific Computing and Informatics Center (SCIC) was developed with funding support from the University, aimed at facilitating the effective use of the new high-performance computing facility by all faculty and students, and supporting the educational initiatives of courses utilizing computational resources. The SCIC also operates a summer program supporting undergraduate research and developing teaching modules (in collaboration with relevant faculty) that directly impacts many courses across the curriculum. <br\/>The cluster and database facility also serve as a focal point and resource for undergraduate students in computationally intensive courses of study, including a recently approved interdisciplinary 'Certificate Program in Informatics and Modeling'.

Projects include image synthesis, comparative genome analysis in yeast, phylogenetic analysis of microbial communities and comparative analysis of bacterial genomes, microarray analysis of gene expression, and bird foraging studies. Both of these instruments will be the first of their kind on the St. Lawrence University (SLU) campus; the microarray scanner is the first in New York State north of Syracuse and the high-end server, the first in any neighboring universities. The placement of a microarray scanner eliminates the need to utilize one in North Carolina that provides services at a discounted rate for faculty conducting research with undergraduate students. This currently useful but unwieldy procedure prevents faculty from expanding the number and types of microarrays used in their research, significantly limiting progress. A single high-end server has been chosen, as opposed to a cluster of computers, due to the simpler programming model inherent in one machine versus many. Most of the St. Lawrence users employ software tools that are parallel, but not distributed, and hence would not benefit from a cluster. The large memory size in one machine is especially beneficial for those research projects that generate large hash tables, such as the BLAST algorithm for genome database querying, and photon-mapping algorithms used in numerical simulations of light scatter.<br\/>The microarray scanner is housed in a common-use equipment room close to faculty microbiology, biochemistry, genetics and cell biology labs where it will be easily accessible to all biology faculty. The scanner and space will be managed by the Department of Biology, but available for use by faculty and students in all science disciplines, as well as scientists\/researchers from the broader North Country Region of New York State (Clarkson University, SUNY-Potsdam, SUNY-Canton, Paul Smith's College). The biology co-PIs oversee day-to-day operations, training, scheduling of all users, and equipment maintenance (via a service contract support from manufacturers). The server will be housed in the SLU Information Technology (IT) Central Server Facility. Physical maintenance is conducted by IT's server manager and IT. User accounts are maintained, and training is conducted. A multidisciplinary Project Steering Committee oversees the use and management of the equipment. With the new microarray scanner on site, the volume of microarray processing will increase, as will the costs associated with running these experiments. These higher research costs will be covered through research support funds from the Biology Department. At the completion of the project period, SLU assumes all costs for the day-to-day operation and long-term maintenance.<br\/>Broader Impacts: <br\/>This instrumentation strongly impacts SLU and strengthens SLU's undergraduate research culture. The new equipment will allow undergraduates in these disciplines to gain experience with key scientific technologies and relevant methodologies. However, the reach of the equipment is not limited to SLU alone; two research projects from neighboring Clarkson University have been identified, and will be a focal point for The Associated Colleges of the St. Lawrence Valley, an educational consortium between St. Lawrence University and three neighboring universities: Clarkson University, State University of New York, (SUNY) Potsdam, and SUNY Canton. This consortium was created to expand the number and variety of educational opportunities for faculty and students, to share resources, and to innovate through joint action. Emphasis is placed on the recruitment of students from underrepresented backgrounds.","title":"MRI-R2: Acquisition of High Performance Computer and Microarray Scanner for Interdisciplinary Research in Computer Science and Biology at St. Lawrence University","awardID":"0959713","effectiveDate":"2010-05-01","expirationDate":"2013-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1189","name":"MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION"}}],"PIcoPI":[435646,435647,"435649",435649,435650,435651],"PO":["557609"]},"161718":{"abstract":"Massive volumes of data are now generated in social, scientific, business and military applications.

Similar interventions have been shown to eliminate a significant share of the black-white achievement gap in urban settings; this project is the first to explore their use in large scale for computer science and engineering<br\/>education.","title":"BPC-LSA: STRONG Computing Pipeline","awardID":"0940592","effectiveDate":"2010-05-01","expirationDate":"2014-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7482","name":"BROADENING PARTIC IN COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[425920,425921,425922,425923,425924],"PO":["561855"]},"166097":{"abstract":"The Texas Tech University Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site program provides opportunities for ten undergraduate students each summer to conduct research on two of the most crucial aspects of computing, software engineering and service composition. This REU Site project meets the needs for an undergraduate computing research environment in the Texas South Plains and contributes to producing graduate students in two essential sub-disciplines of computer science. The overall basis for this REU Site is for research efforts that improve the development of software and service-oriented systems in a wide variety of application domains. There are three major objectives for the proposed REU Site: increase the percentage of women and underrepresented minority students; improve the retention of computer science students; and increase those undergraduate students entering into graduate computing education degree programs.<br\/><br\/>These objectives are met through research that addresses a broad spectrum of means for improving software development. The projects address: software specification generation based on user input and output; construction of a self-managed embedded software system using software specifications; and dynamic techniques for service composition and recovery in a service-oriented environment. The undergraduate student research topics include language development, software tool design and implementation, application development in a variety of application domains to demonstrate applicability, and measurement of the improvements. The technical results of the research efforts with undergraduate students will be disseminated in a broad set of publications. The broadening participation aspects of the broader impacts will be in the women and underrepresented minority students that are recruited for the program, the achievement of success at conducting research, and then continuation on to graduate school.","title":"REU Site: Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Software Engineering and Service Composition","awardID":"1005212","effectiveDate":"2010-05-01","expirationDate":"2014-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1139","name":"RSCH EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD SITES"}}],"PIcoPI":[445009,"553593","539086","553593","539087"],"PO":["564588"]},"158871":{"abstract":"Petascale applications are producing terabytes of data at a great rate. Storage systems in large-scale machines are significantly stressed as I\/O rates are not growing as fast to cope with data production. A variety of HPC activities such as writing output and checkpoint data are all stymied by the I\/O bandwidth bottleneck. Further to this, the post-processing and subsequent analysis\/visualization of computational results is increasingly time consuming due to the widening gap between the storage\/processing capacities of supercomputers and users' local clusters. <br\/><br\/>This research focuses on building a novel in-job dynamic data staging architecture and in bringing it to bear on the looming petascale I\/O crisis. To this end, the following objectives are investigated: (i) the concerted use of node-local memory and emerging hardware such as Solid State Disks (SSDs), from a dedicated set of nodes, as a means to alleviate the I\/O bandwidth bottleneck, (ii) the multiplexing of traditional user post-processing pipelines and secondary computations with asynchronous I\/O on the staging ground to perform scalable I\/O and data analytics, (iii) bypassing memory to access the staging area, and (iv) enabling QoS both in the staging ground and in the communication channel connecting it to compute client and persistent storage. <br\/><br\/>This study will have a wide-ranging impact on future provisioning of extreme-scale machines and will provide formative guidelines to this end. The result of this research will be a set of integrated techniques that can fundamentally change the current parallel I\/O model and accelerate petascale I\/O pipelines. Further, this research will help analyze the utility of SSDs in day-to-day supercomputing I\/O and inform the wider HPC community of its viability.","title":"Collaborative Research: Dynamic Staging Architecture for Accelerating I\/O Pipelines","awardID":"0937842","effectiveDate":"2010-05-01","expirationDate":"2013-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7952","name":"HECURA"}}],"PIcoPI":["561947"],"PO":["565272"]},"154152":{"abstract":"This project is motivated by new connections between the research fields of computational complexity theory and machine learning theory. Computational complexity theory aims to understand which problems can be solved efficiently on a computer by determining the amounts of computational resources such as CPU time, memory space, or circuit area that are required to solve problems. At the center of this field is the famous P vs. NP question which impacts virtually every scientific and engineering discipline, given the thousands of diverse NP-complete problems that have been discovered. Machine learning theory studies the extent to which computers can learn from data and their ability to make future predictions and classifications based on what has been learned. Some powerful learning algorithms have been discovered, but whether computers can be programmed to accomplish many learning tasks remains an open question.<br\/><br\/>Both computational complexity and machine learning aim to understand the capabilities and limitations of computation, but the two fields study different types of problems and use different kinds of techniques. This research will employ techniques and ideas from each of these two fields to impact the other field, specifically with the goal of proving \"lower bound\" results. This research will be accomplished by making use of a new vantage point provided by algorithmic randomness to relate complexity and learning problems. Learning algorithms will be utilized to establish lower bounds on the computational resources required to solve problems in computational complexity. The converse direction will be investigated to apply techniques and ideas from computational complexity to show that \"attribute-efficient\" learning algorithms do not exist for certain concept classes. Algorithmic randomness and Kolmogorov complexity will be used to improve our understanding of the capabilities and limitations of learning algorithms.<br\/><br\/>This research will improve our understanding of computational complexity, which is informative to many areas of science and engineering where computation plays a role. This project aims to better understand what learning tasks can be accomplished efficiently by computers, which has applications to the foundations of artificial intelligence. In particular, this research will identify new obstacles that must be overcome in order to design successful automatic learning systems. A greater synergy will be developed between computational complexity theory and machine learning theory, with the benefit of laying a foundation for future collaboration and interdisciplinary work across these fields.","title":"AF: Small: Learnability, Randomness, and Lower Bounds","awardID":"0917417","effectiveDate":"2010-05-15","expirationDate":"2014-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7927","name":"COMPLEXITY & CRYPTOGRAPHY"}}],"PIcoPI":[410155],"PO":["565157"]},"166032":{"abstract":"In this new REU site proposal the goal is to provide interdisciplinary research experiences for promising students in building massive social networks and exploring applications of these.
