The main objective of this project is to reevaluate the manner in which wireless networks are engineered and spectrum usage is managed so as to exploit dense access infrastructure. The project is expected to make contributions in three areas: 1) Design, analysis and prototyping of communications and network protocols to enable unprecedented fine grain control over transmissions over shared spectrum without requiring high coordination overheads, by leveraging emerging agile access techniques; 2) Design and analysis of novel, simple and sparse-state algorithms that leverage the large flexibility in such systems to achieve near-optimal resource allocations; 3) Modeling and analysis of extreme dense wireless networks using mean field games to both evaluate the performance of resource sharing between providers in this regime, as well as evaluate economic and policy incentives to deploy a range of contractual structures.<br\/><br\/>The proposed research activity relies heavily on the development of sound theory and analysis of extremely dense networks, algorithmic development, simulation for large-scale systems and finally prototyping small-scale regimes. The research will serve as a catalyst towards changing traditional wireless networking paradigm, from one where infrastructure points connect to many mobiles, to one where a mobile connects to a large number of infrastructure nodes. The research will be disseminated broadly to researchers, practitioners and policy makers, leveraging in particular, a strong industry focused research center, as well as in efforts reaching out to public high school students, parents and teachers.","title":"Collaborative Research: Extreme Densification of Wireless Networks","awardID":"1343253","effectiveDate":"2014-01-01","expirationDate":"2017-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7976","name":"EARS"}}],"PIcoPI":[560159],"PO":["557315"]},"209968":{"abstract":"The visual appearance of the world around us is the result of complex light interactions between different surfaces and material properties that comprise a scene. Despite staggering advances in data-driven appearance modeling, the creation of accurate models of large environments remains an open problem. The reliance of most current appearance modeling methods on active lighting to probe different slices of a scene's appearance precludes their use in environments where there is limited or no control over the incident ambient lighting. Furthermore, to facilitate calibration, many appearance modeling techniques estimate the appearance of a scene from a fixed vantage point, excluding scenes too large to fit in a single view with sufficient detail. In this research, the PI will investigate two novel appearance modeling paradigms designed expressly for large-scale environments under uncontrolled ambient lighting: appearance-from-motion and appearance-by-similarity. The former exploits relations between observations from different viewpoints to infer the full reflectance behavior, while the latter seeks to identify the best match from a library of pre-existing appearance instances to a possibly under-constrained set of observations. To support these two paradigms, a novel appearance model will be developed that builds upon our intuitions regarding scene appearance. The work will focus on two common types of input: community photo-collections and targeted video sequences.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This research will pave the way towards practical techniques for in-situ appearance modeling of large-scale environments, while stimulating new research in computer vision and in data-driven appearance modeling in computer graphics by answering fundamental questions as to whether we can model appearance from motion and\/or by exploiting similarity. The project will have far-reaching impact not only on computer science but also on diverse fields ranging from metropolitan planning to cultural heritage to entertainment. The ability to model existing environments will be beneficial to various security and safety training programs (for example, virtual fire drill simulations of existing buildings and sites could help train and prepare firefighters and first responders). The emerging field of virtual reality therapy will also benefit from this research, by making it easier to create digital models of large-scale environments (so that, for example, patients who have suffered a stroke can practice motor rehabilitation skills in virtual reproductions of environments they encounter in their daily lives, while autistic children can train to improve their social interactions in virtual reproductions of places such as classrooms which they encounter in their daily lives).","title":"CAREER: Large-scale Appearance Modeling","awardID":"1350323","effectiveDate":"2014-01-15","expirationDate":"2018-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[562850],"PO":["565227"]},"210012":{"abstract":"In the current age of personal devices and online services, many \"why\" questions people ask are left unanswered.

If a system is transparent, i.e., if a system provides detailed information that reveals its inner working, then we can start answering the \"why\" questions.

Especially, this project focuses on three most pressing areas in personal devices and online services that desire transparency?personal data use, system behavior, and energy usage. For the transparency in personal data use, this project designs techniques to track personal data use across front-end smartphones and back-end data center systems. An automated instrumentation framework for smartphone provenance management and a service for managing provenance in data centers form the core of this functionality. For the transparency in system behavior, this project designs a tracing framework for the Android platform. Our design is tailored to the needs for mobile tracing such as holistic tracing of both applications and the platform as well as instrumentation customization for performance and energy.

A fundamental challenge is that detailed geometric models and advanced nonlinear materials increase computational complexity, making them difficult to apply in real-time interactive applications. In this research, the PI will investigate an alternative approach based on geometric shape deformations rather than the processes which created them. He argues that intuitive shape deformation can be facilitated by guarantees of basic geometric properties such as smoothness and injectivity (no self-intersection). The key is to design algorithms that can do this quickly while providing the user with a small yet expressive set of adjustable controls to ensure an efficient interactive experience; the task of shape deformation techniques is to extrapolate this parsimonious, human manageable set of input controls into a full-scale 3D deformation field in a natural and predictable way. The PI's hypothesis is that this requirement can be formally expressed in terms of basic geometric properties. To this end, the PI will explore both direct (closed-form) and variational methods, because while direct methods excel in speed variational methods offer stronger guarantees and advanced geometric properties. In terms of direct methods, the PI will develop new ways to quickly blend certain groups of 3D transformations (e.g., with the help of new geometric algebraic structures). Transformation blending will be complemented by advanced influence weights that allow the user to explicitly control the resulting sparseness. In terms of variational methods, the PI will study deformation energies satisfying traditional properties such as rotation invariance but augmented with higher-order continuity and injectivity; here, the main challenge will be to find efficient numerical solutions for the underlying optimization problems. The PI believes it will prove possible to mitigate the inherent computational complexity of variational methods by suitably combining them with direct methods so as to cast some of the variational problems as convex optimizations, thereby opening the door to highly efficient convex solvers.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Shape deformation is relevant to architecture, computer aided design (CAD), and many areas of science and engineering, as well as to the entertainment industry. But this project has primarily been motivated by medical applications, inspired by requests from the PI's collaborators at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Given the right tools, the classical field of hand drawn medical illustration will evolve into 3D animated medical atlases, setting new standards in medical education. Shape deformation techniques could ultimately contribute to clinical praxis, by facilitating diagnosis and pre-operative planning when treating conditions such as pathological skull deformities (craniosynostosis). And shape modeling tools in expert hands could help lower the radiation dose required in CT scanning, by applying new reconstruction methods that combine user input with template models and accurate surface scans (obtained with radiation-free methods such as laser scanning). The PI also will organize seminars and courses that bring together medical and engineering students, including members of underrepresented groups, thereby promoting interdisciplinary collaboration in both research and education.","title":"CAREER: Geometric Shape Deformation with Applications in Medicine","awardID":"1350330","effectiveDate":"2014-01-01","expirationDate":"2018-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[562852],"PO":["565227"]},"210860":{"abstract":"Shannon's masterpiece, A Mathematical Theory of Communication (1948), is one of the most influential works in the history of communications.

Extending this theory to network setting has been one of the greatest challenges in information theory over the past few decades. Progress in this area is expected to produce significant breakthrough in the design of distributed wireless networks of the future, such as ad-hoc networks.

At the heart of this approach is the development of simple, deterministic channel models that capture the main features of the wireless medium, and are utilized to approximate more complex models. Building on recent results of the PI, the work develops a unified framework to utilize this powerful approach to 1) approximate the capacity of wireless networks; 2) study the impact of incomplete network knowledge on the capacity; 3) design protocols that are robust against adversaries; and 4) utilize recent physical layer coding techniques for cross-layer protocol design.

Tens of thousands of individual media files in multiple formats were submitted from a variety of sources. These sources included broadcast television feeds, private Close-Circuit Television (CCTV) systems, mobile device photographs and videos recovered from the scene, as well as photographs and videos submitted by the public. Teams of analysts reviewed this evidence using mostly manual processes to determine the sequence of events before and after the bombing, ultimately leading to a quick resolution of the case. In the aftermath, it has become evident that the proliferation of video and image recording devices in fixed and mobile devices make it inevitable that a similar situation will occur in future events. As a result, it is incumbent upon the law enforcement community and the U.S. Government at large to further explore the use of automated approaches, available today or in the coming years, to better organize and analyze such large volumes of multimedia data.

In addition, issues such as data collection and performance evaluation have to be addressed. Given that several hundreds of videos and a large collection of still images may be available for analysis, there is a great need to develop robust computer vision techniques.

However, Femto-aided cellular systems have an information architecture that is very different from current planned and centrally managed cellular architecture. In this project, both the design of information architecture to acquire network state information and the optimal use of the resulting NSI will be addressed. The project is organized into three symbiotic research thrusts on network-aware physical-layer (PHY) coding schemes, network protocols and algorithms leveraging advanced PHYs, and their architectural prototypes. The first thrust utilizes recent innovations in deterministic models of wireless networks and develops novel physical-layer cooperative encoding and decoding schemes that operate with delayed, inconsistent, and erroneous NSI. The second thrust builds on the new physical-layer coding schemes to design network-scheduling algorithms to address performance issues. Finally, the third thrust utilizes the WARP programmable radios and studies implementation challenges of the protocols. The project goals of foundational design for Femto-aided cellular networks will have significant impact on industry practice. The PIs will facilitate technology transfer through their established industry affiliate program.

On one hand, services must keep energy costs low. On the other, they should make costly investments to undo environmental harm caused by their energy footprint. Carbon offsets are transferable certificates that undo greenhouse gas emission, even when offset holders are located in carbon-heavy regions, making them attractive to large-scale, geographically distributed services. This research project lays the foundation for greening services, a new class of Internet services that buy carbon offsets for user requests routed through their servers (i.e., a service that makes other services green). People who use popular large-scale services could undo their carbon footprint by simply routing their requests through a greening service. The greening service would manage costs.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual challenge for greening services is to model or confirm carbon footprints for servers outside of their control. The key insight is that emerging trends within cloud computing, e.g., energy-efficient servers, auto scaling, and open source software, provide uniformity. Dissimilarity between services, in terms of response times and energy footprints, is increasingly due to service-specific features. We use black-box machine learning approaches to infer these features.<br\/><br\/>Beyond greening services, the proposed research will help system managers identify performance bugs, especially costly bugs that shift energy consumption toward datacenters with high energy costs.

In a cloud, the virtualization infrastructure presents an abstraction layer on top of commodity hardware components and manages the execution of guest virtual machines (VMs). However, commodity computer systems are susceptible to hardware errors and expected to experience high error rates in the near future. Notably, a hardware error in a virtualized system can potentially result in a system crash, breaking the assumption of VM fault isolation. This reliability risk is further compounded by the massive scale of data centers hosting hundreds of thousands of servers as well as the pursuit of aggressive server consolidation that aims to host hundreds of VMs on each single server for high resource utilization. Traditional VM fault tolerant solutions are inadequate to address this challenge.<br\/><br\/>This research proposes a hardware error resilient virtualization infrastructure that provides high-performance virtualization during error free execution while offering strong protection against hardware errors. This research will advance our understanding of hardware error behaviors in virtualized environments and develop virtualization-aware techniques that provide robust error detection, recovery, and protection. The proposed hardware error resilient virtualization infrastructure will offer a low-cost full system solution by taking advantage of the characteristics of virtualized systems and providing resource management mechanisms for balanced performance and reliability.<br\/><br\/>The proposed virtualization infrastructure, if successful, will bring substantial benefits to cloud providers in delivering reliable services to millions of users.

The event will take place in conjunction with and immediately preceding the 2014 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL\/HCC), to be held July 28-August 1 in Melbourne, Australia, and sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Symposium. Established in 1984, VL\/HCC's mission is to support the design, formalization, implementation and evaluation of computing systems that are easier for a broader group of people to learn, use, and understand. This includes research aimed at visual technology and text, and technology that uses sound, taste, virtual reality, and the Web. It also includes research on theories about the many media used toward this goal. VL\/HCC occupies a unique niche among HCI and programming language conferences, in that it focuses specifically on how to help end users successfully develop and use software. Recent advances in computing have led to continually deeper integration between computers and human society. People now swim in a \"sea\" of socio-technical systems that synthesize large numbers of contributing users with vast amounts of source code. Examples include social media systems, open source repositories, online marketplaces and massively multiplayer online games. Yet as the socio-technical systems in this sea have grown in complexity, they have become increasingly difficult for end users to understand and direct toward productive ends. More information about the VL\/HCC Symposium may be found online at https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/vlhcc2014. <br\/><br\/>The primary goal of this year's VL\/HCC Doctoral Consortium, the twelfth to be funded by NSF in this series, is to stimulate graduate students' thinking about how to make computation easier to express, manipulate, and understand. In particular, what methods, models and tools can people use to visualize, analyze, tailor, and direct socio-technical systems? The doctoral consortium aims to stimulate novel approaches that go far beyond simplistic solutions like Web browsers and search engines. Although search engines do provide information that is useful in simple situations, they represent only one portion of a socio-technical system (information retrieval); search engines alone are not powerful enough to be used to start new businesses and run them competitively, for example, since they only give people the ability to find resources provided by other people rather than the ability to create new resources. Effective approaches will bring users and software together in creative and productive ways that bear directly on the needs of modern society. <br\/><br\/>The workshop will build community among young researchers working on different aspects of these problems from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education. It will guide the work of these new researchers by providing an opportunity for experts in the research field (as well as their peers) to give them advice, in that student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive feedback from a faculty panel. The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether the results are appropriately analyzed and presented. As in prior years the VL\/HCC 2014 Doctoral Consortium will be part of the regular conference program. A 2-page extended abstract of each participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The workshop will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at alleviating a pressing problem of relevance to a great many people within our society. This event will promote discovery and learning, by encouraging the student researchers to explore a difficult and challenging open problem, through involvement of a panel of well-known researchers whose task is to provide constructive feedback, and through inclusion of other conference participants who will also learn from and provide additional feedback to the students and to each other.

Complementary to existing techniques, this proposal attempts to address the heat management problem using a fundamentally different approach -- rather than removing the heat or slowing down heat generation, we transform this heat into reusable energy by using thermoelectric materials. A Thermal Energy Harvesting (TEHar) framework is proposed here that will allow heat energy generated by computing devices to be recovered, transformed, and harvested efficiently, to achieve better energy efficiency. TEHar is based on the interesting implication of thermal energy distribution of computing platforms: the temperature differences between the hottest and the coldest components can be more than tens of degrees, creating a steep spatial thermal gradient. We discover that, by leveraging the thermoelectric effects at the architectural level, the varying spatial thermal gradients created as a result of computations can be exploited to transform heat into reusable energy. Therefore, the heat generated by the circuitry of the computing devices is not wasted but is rather harvested for reuse. This research explores possibilities in thermal energy harvesting techniques at the architectural level. Overall, this proposal explores the potential for energy harvestability, particularly in the steep thermal gradients commonly observed in computing systems, while also investigating applications that can reuse this recovered energy.<br\/><br\/>The TEHar solution proposed here is anticipated to not only reduce cooling expenses and ambient temperatures, but also increase energy utilization, device lifetime, and physical space utilization. The TEHar technology developed here can be applied to a broad range of computing devices, large or small. If the research is successful, it has the potential of having a significant economic benefit as well as a significant, positive impact on the environment. <br\/><br\/>Furthermore, this energy harvesting research requires cross-disciplinary engagement in areas such as material engineering, VLSI architecture, system architecture, and mechanical engineering and will attract a diverse set of student researchers. Overall, the engineering and scientific contributions will also have important societal impacts, including the broadening of ASU's engineering curriculum, the engagement of graduate as well as undergraduate research activities, the potential of creating high-school or middle-school scientific projects, and the increased representation of target underrepresented minorities in science and engineering.","title":"EAGER: Characterization and Modeling for Architectural Thermal Energy Harvesting","awardID":"1358805","effectiveDate":"2014-01-01","expirationDate":"2015-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["565318"],"PO":["565319"]},"209170":{"abstract":"This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Interdisciplinary Research Program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation in the Directorate for Engineering, the Computer systems Research Program in the Division of Computer and Network Systems in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, and the Robust Intelligence Program in the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.<br\/><br\/>Integrated circuits are produced in billion-dollar chip fabs, which require many months of processing to go from a design to a chip. The goal of this proposal is to accomplish that in an afternoon, with a table-top process. Rather than etching or depositing electronic materials, as is done today, it is based on assembling digital materials. These use a discrete set of components, reversibly joined in a discrete set of relative positions and orientations. Those attributes allow positions to be determined by the parts, errors in their placement to be detected and corrected, dissimilar materials to be joined, and them to be disassembled rather than disposed. A conducting and insulating part type will be used to replace multilayer printed circuit boards, connectors and cabling for three-dimensional interconnect, inductors and capacitors, striplines and antennas.

A test case at this level of integration will be assembling a radiofrequency matching network. Then will come medium-scale integration, using hundreds of parts with a 10 micron feature size. A goal here will be assembling a ring oscillator and binary counter. Finally, large-scale integration will use thousands of parts with a 1 micron feature size, with a goal of assembling a microprocessor.

Recently, scientists have learned how to breed robots, evolving simulated creatures in virtual worlds, or physical robots in the real world. By combining the evolutionary process with robotic engineering, more complex and novel designs should be possible compared to traditional methods. In spite of the promise, so far evolved robots only do simple things like walk, navigate, or pick up objects. What limits progress is a lack of understanding of \"evolvability,\" the capacity of organisms (or robots) to change and become more complex.

The proposed techniques eliminate the violation of privacy through re-identification, and facilitate the secondary usage, sharing, publishing and exchange of healthcare data without the risk of breaching protected health information (PHI). This new privacy-preserving framework injects the ICD-9-CM-aware constraint-based privacy-preserving techniques into EHRs to eliminate the threat of identifying an individual in the secondary use of research data. The proposed technique and development can be readily adapted to other types of healthcare databases in order to ensure privacy and prevent re-identification of published data. The project produces groundbreaking algorithms and tools for identifying privacy leakages and protecting personal privacy information in EHRs to improve healthcare data publishing. New privacy-preserving techniques developed in this project lead towards a new type of healthcare science for EHRs. The project also delivers fundamental advancements to engineering by showing how to integrate biomedical domain knowledge with a computationally advanced quantitative framework for preserving the privacy of published EHRs. HIPAA has established protocols and industry standards to protect the confidentiality of PHI. However, our results demonstrate that, even with regard to health data that meets HIPAA requirements, the risk of re-identification is not completely eliminated. By identifying the security vulnerabilities inherent in the HIPAA standards, our research develops a more rigorous security standard that greatly improves privacy protections by applying state-of-the-art algorithms.<br\/><br\/>The developed data privacy-preserving framework has significant implications for the future of US healthcare data publishing and related applications.

As a result, the quality and quantity of healthcare databases has risen sharply, which has renewed the public's fear of a breach of privacy of their medical information. This research work is innovative and crucial not only for facilitating EHR data publishing, but also for enhancing the development and promotion of EHRs. At the educational front, this project facilitates the development of novel educational tools to construct entirely new courses and laboratory classes for healthcare, data privacy, data mining, and a wide range of applications. As a result, it enhances the current instructional methods for teaching data privacy and data mining, and has compelling biomedical and healthcare applications that can facilitate learning of computational algorithms.

Computing researchers have recently worked to understand how systems can support nutrition and exercise, but sleep has been relatively under-studied despite its significant health benefits. The right amount of quality sleep can improve both physical and mental health and is associated with a lower risk for heart disease, diabetes, depression, and obesity. However, sleep disorders are often undiagnosed, and many people are unaware of how their activities or environments affect sleep. Ubiquitous computing has the opportunity to help through self-monitoring, awareness, and identification of strategies to promote healthy sleep behaviors.<br\/><br\/>This interdisciplinary research agenda will involve the design, development, and evaluation of novel ubiquitous computing approaches to support good sleep health and behaviors. This research will combine expertise in human-centered design, computer science, sleep medicine, and nursing. The researchers' previous formative work with target users and sleep experts has informed design requirements for technologies in this field. The work will focus on building on those results through three main activities. First, they will apply machine learning to model sleep patterns based on a person's smartphone usage to unobtrusively sense and predict sleep duration and timing. Then they will employ a human-centered design process to develop and study the feasibility and initial efficacy of two novel software tools to assist individuals in sensing, recording, and visualizing the behavioral (e.g., caffeine use, food intake) and environmental factors (e.g., noisy environment, light levels) that can disrupt their sleep. And then, they will develop and assess the feasibility and initial efficacy of a new technique and tool for assessing, modeling, and visualizing the impact of sleep deprivation on users' reaction time, cognitive functioning, and mood to help them prioritize sleep.<br\/><br\/>This research will bring into focus the domain of sleep as a new area for human-centered computing research. The design and evaluation of new applications for sleep will further knowledge of how technology can be designed for long-term health tracking and behavior change, and the designs and evaluations move beyond what is currently being addressed in industry. The technical contributions are novel approaches to monitoring sleep and an expansion of knowledge about how technologies can adapt to meet the unique health needs of different users. Finally, the research seeks to unite the fields of sleep research and computing research to develop solutions for better understanding and treating sleep disorders.<br\/><br\/>This work has the potential to significantly affect the lives of the estimated 40.6 million individuals in the U.S. with sleep disorders or sleep deprivation, which helps address a major public health issue. In addition, the economic cost of sleep deprivation has been estimated to be $63.8 billion per year. The research will have immediate impact by allowing free access to new behavior change technologies developed through this project. In addition, the research will also impact education by using sleep research as a means for attracting women and minorities to computing research and engaging students in interdisciplinary design teams through student projects and directed research groups.","title":"SCH: INT: Supporting Healthy Sleep Behaviors through Ubiquitous Computing","awardID":"1344613","effectiveDate":"2014-01-01","expirationDate":"2016-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8018","name":"Smart Health & Wellbeing"}}],"PIcoPI":[560939,560940,560941,560942],"PO":["565136"]},"209010":{"abstract":"Network densification - where a multitude of base-stations and access points with overlapping wireless footprints and disparate capabilities pervade the physical domain - is the way forward towards meeting the tremendous demand for mobile data.

Additional information about users can help generate intelligent designs in CRNs that can shorten spectrum access delay. However, due to practical constraints, such information is extremely difficult to obtain before rendezvous is established. Mining the social patterns of CR users (or secondary users, SUs) and intelligently utilizing the captured social information is a promising approach. The objective of this project is to design, analyze, and evaluate fast and efficient spectrum access schemes for CRNs without a common control channel.

Despite their importance within the energy sector, buildings have not kept pace with technological improvements and particularly the introduction of intelligent features. A primary obstacle in enabling intelligent buildings is their highly distributed and diffuse nature. To address this challenge, a modular approach will be investigated for building design, construction, and operation that would completely transform the building industry. Buildings would be assembled from a set of pre-engineered intelligent modules and commissioned on site in a \"plug-and-play\" manner much like a \"LEGO\" set but with added capability of (a) allowing for easy configuration and re-configuration that can be integrated to provide delivery of thermal and visual comfort, ventilation; (b) providing optimized controls in terms of overall occupant satisfaction and energy efficiency and performance monitoring. The primary goal of the research is to develop and demonstrate innovative concepts for distributed intelligence along with a new paradigm for plug-and-play building control that is a necessary precursor in enabling this transformation. To accomplish these tasks, the investigators constitute a multidisciplinary team with expertise from three engineering disciplines, namely Civil (Architectural), Mechanical, Electrical and Computer Engineering. The intellectual merit of this research lies in developing a unified approach that advances the engineering of cyber-physical systems (CPS) for buildings by contributing to the following fields: (a) modeling and identification of building subsystems and integrated systems; (b) multi-agent system networks that enable distributed intelligent monitoring and control of multi-zone buildings; (c) optimal control algorithms for stochastic hybrid systems that can optimize the operation of buildings with mode changes under uncertainty. These contributions will be integrated in simulation and experimental platforms for multi-agent building system networks to validate the developed algorithms and to provide a new CPS-based technological solution to the control and optimization of modular buildings. An initial knowledge\/technology base will be provided for scalable, adaptive, robust, and efficient engineering solutions for cyber-enabled building systems that will transform the current building operation practice, enabling the next generation of smart buildings with optimized comfort delivery and energy use. The broader impacts of this project are: (a) Theoretical development of modeling representations, algorithms, and simulation tools that will impact a number of scientific communities, including Civil\/Architectural, Mechanical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Operations Research. The proposed new principles for heterogeneous multi-agent system networks, distributed intelligence, and optimal hybrid control algorithms will have impacts in a diverse range of fields outside of building systems such as power systems, transportation systems, robotics, etc.; (b) Integration of the proposed modeling, simulation, and experimental platforms into new teaching modules and experiential learning activities that support the curriculum development in three engineering schools and Purdue?s first year engineering program; (c) Dissemination of research outcomes to the industry to open up a new horizon of business and economy that would enable the growth of green and intelligent buildings; (d) The creation of outreach and engagement initiatives that motivate K-12 teachers and students in STEM learning and research, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in engineering, and motivate undergraduate students to participate in research related to emerging CPS topics.","title":"CPS: Synergy: Plug-and-Play Cyber-Physical Systems to Enable Intelligent Buildings","awardID":"1329875","effectiveDate":"2014-01-01","expirationDate":"2016-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0702","name":"Division of CHEM, BIOENG, ENV, &  TRANSP S","abbr":"CBET"},"pgm":{"id":"7643","name":"ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY"}}],"PIcoPI":[553622,553623,553624,553625],"PO":["565364"]},"205560":{"abstract":"In this research the PI will develop efficient mesh-based algorithms to simulate the dynamics and interactions of thin liquid structures such as sheets, jets, bubbles, and films. The thin geometry of these liquid phenomena poses tremendous difficulties for traditional techniques, leading to long runtimes and excessive memory consumption. The PI argues that a fundamentally different approach that recognizes and exploits the unique geometry of thin liquids is needed in order to simulate them efficiently and accurately (by analogy with the special treatment of thin elastic bodies such as rods, plates, shells). The project is comprised of three thrusts. First, the PI will develop algorithms for the dynamic simulation of liquid bodies composed of high viscosity threads and sheets, including physical modeling, collision processing, topology changes, and mixed dimensional remeshing. Second, he will address the specific challenges of low viscosity jets and sheets, considering in particular the enhanced influence of surface tension, sheet breakup, and the choice of Eulerian vs. Lagrangian evolution. Finally, he will examine the deformations of films, bubbles, and foams, using a new mesh-based representation for deforming multi-region interfaces, coupled to the fluid dynamics of the surrounding air. In each thrust, the predictive power of the techniques developed will be validated against both experimental observations and theoretical results from the literature.<br\/><br\/>To these ends, the PI will bring several geometric and computational techniques from the dynamics of thin elastica to bear on the dynamics of thin fluids. The PI believes this cross-pollination of ideas has the potential to provide dramatic improvements in efficiency and accuracy, while yielding computational tools that complement theory and experiment in the study of thin fluid phenomena. By considering a thin material as a lower dimensional object (curve or surface) with an associated thickness, the dimension of the problem can be reduced, yielding improved numerical properties and better allocation of degrees of freedom. This perspective has never before been applied to develop computational techniques for three-dimensional thin liquids. The use of non-manifold meshes to represent mixed bodies of thin liquids also opens up previously unexplored challenges in mixed dimensional remeshing and the handling of topological transitions. Furthermore, the proposed surface tracking representation builds on robust collision-processing techniques originally applied to cloth animation, and will offer the first surface mesh-based technique for the evolution of multi-material interfaces. This will allow for more accurate tracking of bubbles and general multiphase flows than can be achieved with state-of-the-art implicit surface approaches.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Thin liquids are crucial to a broad class of problems in computer graphics, engineering, and scientific applications. Liquid animations are increasingly prevalent in visual effects-driven films, yet thin splashes remain among the most difficult effects to animate. Thin threads and sheets of viscous liquids arise in applications from food processing to cosmetics, from the geophysics of the earth's crust to the forming and blowing of elaborate glass artwork. They are the subject of substantial concurrent experimental and theoretical investigation, and complementary computational tools for these problems could offer vital new insights. The potential applications for low viscosity liquids and foams are equally wide-ranging. Project outcomes will be reported at major international venues including the SIGGRAPH conferences, and the associated computational tools will be made publicly available. A variety of education and outreach efforts, some of which specifically target minority middle school students, are also planned.","title":"CGV: Small: Mesh-based Simulation of Thin Liquid Structures","awardID":"1319483","effectiveDate":"2014-01-01","expirationDate":"2016-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7453","name":"GRAPHICS & VISUALIZATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["554341",550426],"PO":["565227"]},"208981":{"abstract":"Innovative use of wireless devices such as smartphones in various mobile applications has exacerbated the congestion over cellular spectrum.

Superposing the binding cavities of one protein onto another can reveal shape similarities that explain why two proteins bind a similar molecular partner. Superposition can also expose critical differences that explain why proteins sometimes bind very different partners. These observations, made by experts in structural biology with the computational aid of protein structure alignments, help construct our atomic-level understanding of protein binding preferences. Protein binding preferences lie at the crux of many pressing challenges in protein engineering, systems biology, drug design, and other fields.<br\/><br\/>This project considers a new approach to protein structure alignment that generates superposition by maximizing the overlapping volume between binding cavities. Two core research directions will be considered: (1) The development of specialized optimization techniques that rapidly and reliably explore the continuous space of alignments and (2) the usage of biological and biophysical data to enhance the alignment process.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed work advances the study of protein structure comparison with new representations of protein structure and new geometric superposition techniques. A novel focus on closely related proteins also diverges from existing methods, which generally target proteins with distant evolutionary ties. The project advances techniques in mathematical optimization for accommodating the noisy and expensive estimation of overlapping cavity volume. Accommodations of this nature are an emerging challenge in optimization, where the function being optimized is frequently the result of imprecise and expensive computations, like simulations. The low dimensionality of the cavity alignment problem, coupled with the opportunity to optimize in the presence of noise and imprecision creates a unique opportunity to advance techniques for this general challenge in optimization. In structural biology, the proposed work will add automation and precision to existing workflows, enabling the examination of more structures than humans can fully consider and identifying molecular subtleties that might otherwise be overlooked.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The project also focuses on developing interactive software for protein structure comparison. This software will provide a visual and intuitive interface, helping students and scientists from non-computational background to better use and understand software in structural bioinformatics. The research itself and the development of the interface software will expose graduate and undergraduate students with mono-disciplinary backgrounds to an interdisciplinary research program in bioinformatics, and train them in cross-disciplinary communication.","title":"AF: Small: Volumetric Alignment of Protein Cavities for the Analysis of Ligand Binding Specificity","awardID":"1320137","effectiveDate":"2014-01-01","expirationDate":"2016-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7931","name":"COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY"}}],"PIcoPI":[550735,550736],"PO":["565223"]},"208972":{"abstract":"As cognitive radio (CR) research advances to multihop and complex systems over large geographic regions, the spectrum utilization enhancement should be generalized to fully exploit the spectrum usage diversity in three dimensions (3D): time, frequency, and space, with new emphasis on the under-explored spatial dimension.

On the other hand, many licensed spectrum blocks are left unused. Although cognitive radios (CR) technology has emerged as an enabler for unlicensed users to opportunistically access the unused licensed spectrum, most previous works commonly assume that each user is equipped with a CR which can operate across a wide range of spectrum. This may be possible in theory, but may not be practical for light-weight devices such as cell phones. How to effectively utilize the CR technology to build more flexible networks so that even non-CR capable devices can benefit from the opportunistic access to the unused spectrum is therefore in dire need.<br\/><br\/>In this project, the PIs propose a novel cognitive mesh assisted cellular network (CMCN) and investigate: 1) the architectural design of CMCN so that unoccupied licensed spectrum can be efficiently utilized and non-cognitive cellular devices can benefit from the CR technology, 2) spectrum and energy efficient CR mesh router placement under uncertain spectrum availability, 3) how to construct a fine-grained spectrum map to facilitate efficient spectrum allocation and intelligent traffic delivery, and 4) experimental validation and implementation for the proposed design. The research outcome provides a viable solution to the spectrum congestion in cellular systems. Moreover, with this flexible architecture, telecommunication industries can be rejuvenated with new innovations, leading to further development of cellular networks with high capacity and better support of new applications such as mobile healthcare, which has significant impact on individuals' lives and further provides greater opportunities for job creation and economic growth.

This project aims to develop intelligent clinical decision support techniques for recommending optimal action plans - including both diagnostic tests and medical interventions - for treating chronic disease, performing multi-step and adaptive treatments, and modifying long-term health habits. In an effort to integrate evidence-driven decision-making with established clinical practices, the research will develop disease-agnostic artificial intelligence techniques that combine data from large electronic health records (EHRs) with recommendations from human experts. A prototype decision support system will be tested on three clinical settings - cardiology, clinical depression, and emergency room readmission - using existing EHR datasets and consultation with domain experts from clinical partners. Outcomes-driven and cost-driven optimized decisions will be compared to current clinical practice. This exploratory research will provide the groundwork for follow-up projects in decision support information presentation, integration with clinical workflow and IT systems, and making the transition from retrospective studies to clinical trials. Other broader impacts include workshops for healthcare applications of AI, and women and minority students will be recruited and mentored in graduate and undergraduate computer science research.<br\/><br\/>The technical approach of this research builds on state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to automatically learn, simulate, and reason about patient-specific treatment plans. Such methods must be simultaneously probabilistic and temporal. Probabilistic techniques are needed to handle significant uncertainties in clinical diagnoses and outcomes, much like a human clinician would. Temporal techniques are needed to consider sequences of future decisions over the course of treatment, rather than decisions at single time points. More specifically, this project will consider the use of statistical relational learning (SRL) techniques to mine for probabilistic, temporal patterns in large electronic health records, and these patterns will be used in partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that exhaustively search for optimal treatment sequences. Recent results indicate that SRL achieves superior performance to other machine learning methods in predicting cardiac arrest from demographic and lifestyle observations, and POMDP treatment plans outperform existing fee-for-service practices by reducing costs by 50% and improving outcomes by 40% on a clinical depression dataset. By combining SRL and POMDPs, specifically, using SRL to learn a disease progression model used by the POMDP, this project aims to achieve further improvements in recommendation quality and computational scalability for complex treatments. Furthermore, because EHRs may suffer from limited or missing data, clinical decision support tools should follow established practices and expert knowledge when necessary. To do so, new workflows for integrating expert knowledge into SRL and POMDPs will be explored. Evaluation will be performed on a variety of disease scenarios in conjunction with clinical partners at Marshfield Clinic, Centerstone, Wake Forest School of Medicine, and South Bend Memorial Hospital.","title":"SCH: EXP: Intelligent Clinical Decision Support with Probabilistic and Temporal EHR Modeling","awardID":"1343940","effectiveDate":"2014-01-01","expirationDate":"2016-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8018","name":"Smart Health & Wellbeing"}}],"PIcoPI":[560558,560559,560560],"PO":["565136"]},"208973":{"abstract":"As cognitive radio (CR) research advances to multihop and complex systems over large geographic regions, the spectrum utilization enhancement should be generalized to fully exploit the spectrum usage diversity in three dimensions (3D): time, frequency, and space, with new emphasis on the under-explored spatial dimension.

Graph routing problems typically aim at connecting pairs of graph vertices with disjoint or nearly disjoint paths. Routing problems are central to combinatorial optimization, and arise in many different applications. Algorithms for graph drawing assist with visualizing a given graph, by appropriately drawing it in the plane. Graph sparsifiers allow us to replace a given graph by a much smaller one, that preserves the routing properties of the original graph. Optimization problems can then be solved on the smaller graph, thus obtaining faster algorithms. This project aims at developing better approximation algorithms for graph routing and drawing problems, and constructing better and smaller vertex sparsifiers. The PI will also study graph partitioning problems, that play a central role in designing algorithms for many problems in the areas of graph routing, drawing, sparsification, and beyond.<br\/><br\/>Graphs are among the most basic combinatorial objects, and are often used to model various applications, or to represent data. Algorithms for graph partitioning, routing and drawing are central tools for manipulating graphs and solving optimization problems on them.

The existing theoretical foundation that guides the design of practical communication systems -- traditional information theory -- focuses almost exclusively on the transmit energy. For many modern short-distance communication systems, however, the energy consumed in the processing circuitry dominates over the transmit energy. The proposed research will advance the existing theory and practice by examining flows of information in the supporting circuitry in order to obtain a fundamental understanding of total (transmit + circuit) energy. A three-layer approach will be adopted to reduce energy consumption: (i) The Foundational Layer for expanding the frontiers of traditional information theory by incorporating processing energy at the transmitting and receiving ends; (ii) The Design Layer for novel designs of strategies including error-correcting codes that minimize the total energy; and (iii) The Validation Layer for assessing the energy reductions for various applications through strategies proposed in the Design Layer.<br\/><br\/>Applications ranging from education, healthcare, manufacturing, and commerce today rely on uninterrupted and ubiquitous connectivity. Consequently, it has become increasingly important to keep the energy consumed in communication networks low, both for improving battery life of wireless devices and for sustainability of high-energy wired communication (such as ethernet links in data centers). Broadly speaking, the traditional design approach follows a \"division-of-labor\": the transmission strategy is first chosen to best approach the information-theoretic limits on minimum transmit energy, and then the most energy-efficient circuits are built to support the chosen strategy. The proposed research rethinks this division-of-labor by jointly designing the transmission strategy and circuits to maximize system-level energy efficiency. This research necessitates simplification and synthesis of concepts in communication, computation, and circuits. The project incorporates several educational and outreach efforts, including organizing interactive workshops for K-12 students and developing new material for both theoretical and experimental classes towards educating cross-disciplinary leaders not just in research, but also in industry where such education is essential for increased innovation.","title":"CAREER: Towards Green Communications Using an Information-Lens: Foundations of the Joint Design of Communication Strategies and Circuits","awardID":"1350314","effectiveDate":"2014-01-15","expirationDate":"2018-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7797","name":"COMM & INFORMATION FOUNDATIONS"}}],"PIcoPI":[562848],"PO":["564924"]},"208339":{"abstract":"Cleveland State University (CSU) in collaboration with the University of California San Diego (UCSD), proposes CISS -- Computing in Secondary Schools -- a CS10K project designed to provide computer science education professional development to high school teachers throughout the state of Ohio.

Usability may not always be properly maintained or human operators may not be able to complete the task goals that a system was designed to support. This can result in poor adoption of the system, decreased productivity with its use, or unsafe operating conditions. Mathematical tools and techniques called \"formal methods\" exist for modeling and providing proof-based evaluations of different elements of HCI including the human-computer interface, the human operator's task analytic behavior, and usability. Unfortunately, these approaches require the creation of formal models of interface designs, something that is non-standard practice and prone to modeling error. This project will show that a formal-methods approach can be used to automatically generate formal human-computer interface designs that are guaranteed to adhere to usability properties and to support human operator tasks. Specifically, a system that uses the L* machine learning algorithm will be created that will generate formal interface designs using task analytic behavior models and formal representations of usability properties.<br\/><br\/>The researchers will implement an interface generation system, test its performance with a suite of benchmark examples, and evaluate its ability to generate an interface for a realistic application. To implement the generator, the researchers will first construct an oracle system capable of accepting or rejecting interface state transition sequences based on analyst-specified task models and usability properties. This oracle system will be connected to an implementation of the L* algorithm that will progressively learn a formal interface model by observing how generated sequences of interface state transitions are accepted or rejected by the oracle. Artificial test cases that exploit the different features of the system will be used to generate interface designs, and formal verification will be used to check that the designs exhibit the intended properties. The system will be used to generate the human-computer interface for programming a patient controlled analgesia pump, a medical device that automatically delivers pain medication to patients intravenously. The generated interface will then be compared against the formal interface design standard that exists for these devices.<br\/><br\/>The automatic generation of human-computer interface designs from task analytic models and usability properties constitutes a novel approach to user-centered design. By using this method in the creation of interfaces, designs will be guaranteed to always exhibit certain properties. This will potentially help ensure that designs will be accepted by users, improve the associated system's efficiency, and facilitate safer operation. The formal representation of user interfaces that result from the implementation of this method will also permit HCI designers to pursue formal analysis and verification of other interface properties, and will facilitate the automated generation of test cases for usability verification and certification purposes.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The proposed research has the potential to significantly change the way human-computer interfaces are designed. By guaranteeing that generated interfaces are always usable, this research could improve the usability and safety of user interfaces across many domains. The performance guarantees of the generated designs could allow development and testing times to be reduced, thus decreasing development and software costs.
