Mapping WordNet's words and concepts into those of other languages requires disambiguation, identification, and discrimination of related entities. We first group WordNet's finely distinguished senses of highly polysemous nouns, verbs, and adjectives into underspecified \"super\"-senses to facilitate discrimination and disambiguation. Second, we add to the verbs in WordNet sentences illustrating their subcategorization patterns and selectional restrictions so as to better distinguish senses and facilitate matching the verb lexicons of different languages. The project is significant because it creates a resource that meets present demands for multilingual Natural Language Processing applications. Moreover, the augmentations carry considerable theoretical interest. Systematic underspecification of lexical entries might lead towards a psychologically realistic lexicon. A principled grouping of closely related senses will shed light on the nature of polysemy and specific ways in which flexible word meanings yield possible sense extensions in all areas of the lexicon. Subcategorization information and selectional restrictions will reveal the extent to which the semantic relatedness of verbs, expressed in WordNet's relational structure, is correlated with syntactic relatedness.","title":"WordNet as an Interlingual Lexical Resource","awardID":"9805732","effectiveDate":"1998-11-15","expirationDate":"2000-10-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6845","name":"HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["511536"],"PO":["565227"]},"34147":{"abstract":"This proposal request support to enable American and International scholars and graduate students to participate in the Conference on the History of Science Information Systems, as well as to broaden the dissemination and impact of the conference discussions. The history of science is a well established scholarly field, but study of the evolution of scientific information systems is a relatively new topic, rapidly gaining in importance as the information revolution unfolds. This conference is the first event of significant scale solely devoted to the history and heritage of science information systems. It builds on and extends two landmark conferences. The first of these is the Scientific Information Conference convened by the Royal Society in London in 1948, and the second, the 1958 International Conference on Science Information, sponsored by the National Science Foundation. The present event is to be held immmediately preceding and in conjunction with the annual meeting of the American Society for Information Science (ASIS).","title":"Conference on the History of Science Information Systems","awardID":"9814034","effectiveDate":"1998-11-15","expirationDate":"2000-10-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6857","name":"DIGITAL LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES"}}],"PIcoPI":[85952,"441923"],"PO":["564456"]},"37687":{"abstract":"EIA-9871443 LeBlanc, James P. Jedlicka, Russ New Mexico State University MRI: Development of WISTE: Wireless Indoor Space-Time Environment The objective is to develop and operate a wireless indoor environment within New Mexico State University's electrical engineering building which is capable of measuring and statistically quantifying the space-time characteristics of the indoor wireless channel. Such an environment would provide benefit to wireless researchers as well as promote interest among university engineering students. To the researchers, the experimental results will provide an ability to infer appropriate signal-processing and channel-coding strategies. The instrumented environment will allow assessment of various hypotheses by providing measurements and models that help researchers better understand the spatial and temporal aspects of the wireless indoor channel. Measurements and statistical models will be made available to researchers nationwide through the Internet. This mechanism allows effective and timely dissemination of needed information on wireless communications and networking. To the university student, the environment will promote the graduate research programs due to the equipment's visible presence within the EE building and its use in both undergraduate and graduate classes. Furthermore, undergraduate students' participation in performing such experiments will provide hands-on experience for those heading into industry.","title":"MRI: Development of WISTE: Wireless Indoor Space-Time Environment","awardID":"9871443","effectiveDate":"1998-11-01","expirationDate":"2003-10-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1189","name":"MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION"}}],"PIcoPI":[95564,95565],"PO":["557609"]},"49373":{"abstract":"","title":"REU: Multiple Autonomous Mobile Robots for Search and Rescue Applications","awardID":"9996356","effectiveDate":"1998-11-15","expirationDate":"2000-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1106","name":"Division of HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT","abbr":"HRD"},"pgm":{"id":"7915","name":"Ethics & Values of SET"}}],"PIcoPI":[126264,"565226"],"PO":["297837"]}}
