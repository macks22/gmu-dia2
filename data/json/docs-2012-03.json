{"187330":{"abstract":"This project, developing models for complex swarming behaviors by incrementally starting from the properties of an individual agent, which includes noisy sensors and actuators and stochastic behavior, and validating the models by systematic experimentation with physical systems, will bridge the gap between analysis by simple primitives and their composition into complex swarming behaviors. Specifically, this research will consist of a comprehensive study of containment, partitioning, and re-configuration swarming primitives, and then show how they can be composed into complex swarming behaviors such as pattern recognition, sensor-based motion, and adaptive shape change. These primitives and behaviors have been chosen because they challenge existing modeling approaches and lead to independent contributions addressing grand challenge applications by themselves.<br\/><br\/>Inspired by the robust and scalable operation of bees, termites, ants and multi-cellular organisms, the funding of this proposed work will lead to a methodology to compose stochastic swarming behaviors in a principled way using probabilistic models. These models will be grounded in the probabilistic behavior of an individual agent's sensing, actuation, communication and computational properties by modeling the system at multiple levels of abstraction going back and forth from physical experimentation, kinematic models, and stochastic simulations to macroscopic difference equations. By grounding the models in physical experiments, models will be able to serve as design tool for not only the computational, but also the physical properties of an individual agent.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: A principled methodology for modeling and designing swarming systems will create the foundation for designing and deploying swarm robotic systems for search and rescue, environmental response, precision agriculture, and surveillance, among others. At the same time, the ability to design swarms might also shed light on the workings of biological and chemical systems, such as social insects, multi-cellular systems, and self-assembly, enabling the design of complex multi-cellular systems with arbitrary functionality. Finally, algorithms and systems resulting from this research lend themselves to artistic installations, drawing a broad public into the fascination of swarming systems and nurture an understanding for the distributed nature that is common to all living systems. The proposed research will be deeply integrated with education. Specific offerings developed in this integrated research and education plan include: a modular robotic activity that introduces computational thinking to 4th graders, a crash-course on embedded systems geared at 1st year students from under-represented groups, a comprehensive robotics curriculum for upperclassmen, and an interdisciplinary graduate seminar on \"Swarm Intelligence\" and \"Self-Assembly\" that will actively involve students from other disciplines and encourage them to apply the proposed multi-level modeling methodology to their research.","title":"CAREER: Modeling and Design of Composite Swarming Behaviors","awardID":"1150223","effectiveDate":"2012-03-01","expirationDate":"2017-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8013","name":"National Robotics Initiative"}}],"PIcoPI":["520181"],"PO":["564069"]},"188551":{"abstract":"This award funds a CISE REU program entitled Research on Biomedical Informatics at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.

For example, determining whether an email were spam would be as simple as searching a labeled database of emails and assigning it the same label (spam or not) as the email considered most similar to it. But how can one measure the similarity of two email messages? Does the same measurement still apply when comparing medical images? How does our understanding of similarity depend on the problem specification? Metric learning optimizes distance functions specifically for a given task, taking into account both the learning problem and the data. Initial successes with linear metrics show great improvements on many \"k-nearest neighbors\"-based learning tasks. <br\/><br\/>This project pursues four research directions that strengthen the theoretical understanding of metric learning within the research community, broaden its impact and significantly improve the current state-of-the-art: <br\/><br\/>1. Are there non-linear transformations that lead to equally elegant and efficient optimization problems as existing linear metrics? As data sets grow and become increasingly complex, linear metrics are no longer sufficient to capture similarity relations. By exploring the use of non-linear metrics, this research can substantially improve the impact of metric learning and the accuracy of similarity relations. <br\/><br\/>2. Can the impact of metric learning be extended to machine learning frameworks beyond nearest neighbors? Designing new metric learning algorithms that explicitly optimize distances for a broad variety of machine learning algorithms will significantly increase the number of applications and learning methods that can directly benefit from metric learning. <br\/><br\/>3. Can metrics be learned from weak supervision? Removing the dependency on labeled data will reduce the cost of metric learning and increase its applicability. <br\/><br\/>4. Can one develop a solid theoretical framework to explain preliminary empirical successes and to direct future research? This will strengthen the theoretical understanding of metric learning within the research community. <br\/><br\/>Successful resolution of the proposed problems will lead to novel learning methods which will be immediately applicable to ongoing high-impact medical research collaborations of the principal investigator. In conjunction with these research directions, the principal investigator will also pursue educational goals, including the co-development of a K-12 curriculum module estimated to impact 2,500 high-school students.

This effort seeks to solve this type of problem with a coarse approach using 3-D perception that uses range sensing to find general curved surface patches in the environment that might be suitable for foot placement. Along with patches on the robot itself, these patches are placed into a novel dynamic spatial patch map with estimated uncertainty that mates robot patches with environmental patches.

In large-scale computing clusters, operational and cooling costs impose significant sustainability challenges. Embedded systems run increasingly complex, performance demanding workloads, making the well-known energy management policies inadequate. High power densities also cause high on-chip temperatures and large thermal variations, both of which degrade system reliability. <br\/><br\/>The research goal of this project is to demonstrate that 3D stacked systems, where multiple chips are vertically attached, can provide dramatic increases in energy efficiency. Realizing this ambitious energy efficiency goal requires novel analysis, design, and runtime management techniques. This project?s objective is creating these catalyst techniques to make 3D systems effective agents for attaining low-power, high-throughput computing in both embedded and large-scale computing domains. Specific research directions are: (1) developing a widely applicable methodology for jointly analyzing the performance, energy, and temperature characteristics of 3D multi-core systems; (2) designing runtime management policies to maximize performance under thermal or power constraints; (3) optimizing liquid-cooled 3D systems to push the performance bounds while maintaining reliable and low-energy operation. <br\/><br\/>A realizable target for this project in the next decade is a significant reduction in overall energy consumption for computing infrastructure, which translates into monetary savings and carbon footprint reduction. The project also has immediate impact on the system and software design practice.

The emphasis is on elucidating the motions that proteins employ for biological function. This is a fundamental issue in the understanding of proteins and biology due to the central role of proteins in cellular processes.<br\/><br\/>The research addresses fundamental issues in protein modeling. Understanding proteins in silico involves searching a vast high-dimensional conformational space of inherently flexible systems with numerous inter-related degrees of freedom, complex geometry, physical constraints, and continuous motion. Three core research directions are identified. (1) Geometric constraints underlying protein motion are not trivial to identify or address. The proposed research exploits mechanistic analogies between proteins and robot kinematic linkages and investigates inverse kinematics techniques to efficiently formulate and address complex geometric constraints arising in diverse protein studies. (2) The funnel-like protein energy landscape exposes physics-based energetic constraints that are often demanding to address in silico. The proposed research pursues a multiscale treatment of energetic constraints in the context of probabilistic search, supporting coarse- and fine-grained levels of protein representational detail and converting between them with information gathered during exploration. (3) The conformational ensemble view of the protein state relevant for function necessitates search algorithms capable of exploring the high-dimensional conformational space and its rugged energy landscape. A novel probabilistic search framework is proposed that gathers information about the space it explores and employs this information to advance towards promising unexplored regions of the space. Taken together, these research directions allow addressing complexity in proteins by formulating and exploiting geometric and energetic constraints, thus narrowing the search space of interest to regions where the constraints are satisfied, and by employing a novel probabilistic framework with enhanced sampling capability able to feasibly search the relevant regions of the space.<br\/><br\/>The proposed activity promises to advance discovery and understanding both in the computer science and protein biophysics communities. Since most problems of practical interest are high-dimensional and often exhibit complex non-linear spaces, the proposed research cuts across and spans multiple areas in computer science, such as robot motion planning, optimization in complex non-linear spaces, and modeling and simulation of complex physics-based systems. In particular, the research will reveal effective probabilistic search strategies for continuous high-dimensional search spaces. Analogies with articulated mechanisms will offer insight on how to generate valid robot configurations in the presence of constraints. On the biophysical side, the research promises to advance protein modeling and understanding across diverse applications. The proposed activity involves interdisciplinary collaborations with computer scientists, biophysicists, and chemists. Findings and data will be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific understanding across diverse communities. Specific educational objectives focusing on curriculum design and outreach activities are formulated to employ the proposed research for broadening the participation of college and pre-college students, with a particular emphasis on underrepresented groups.","title":"CAREER: Probabilistic Methods for Addressing Complexity and Constraints in Protein Systems","awardID":"1144106","effectiveDate":"2012-03-01","expirationDate":"2017-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["565088"],"PO":["565136"]},"188656":{"abstract":"This funding renews a successful CISE Research Experiences for<br\/>Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Texas at Dallas.<br\/>This site focuses on Software Engineering research related to<br\/>Software Safety.

Heterogeneity specializes hardware for particular applications and deploys a mix of hardware for a mix of application needs. Specialization improves efficiency as overheads from supporting general, arbitrary computation are reduced. To realize heterogeneous efficiency, this project is rethinking design and deployment. Rethinking design to reduce specialization costs, this project is parameterizing hardware designs to facilitate their re-use, applying statistical inference to explore design spaces, and clustering applications that have similar hardware needs to increase each design?s market volume.

Presently, the research value of this task has been heightened by the increased availability of massive network data in the domains of life and social sciences. However, existing algorithms for subgraph mining suffer from various limitations; noteworthy among these are lack of scalability, lack of user interaction and the absence of a mechanism to mine dynamic graphs. This research aims to overcome the above limitations by accomplishing the following three related tasks: (1) use of Monte Carlo sampling mechanisms for designing scalable graph mining algorithms; (2) develop real-time interactive graph mining systems using subgraph sampling approaches; and (3) discover models for graph evolution that are based on sampling and driven by the principles of game theory and economics.<br\/><br\/>This research builds a novel paradigm for subgraph mining that is based on Monte Carlo sampling. This allows the development of algorithms that are scalable, by avoiding the need to enumerate all subgraph patterns. The resulting algorithms will be applied to subgraph mining problems in systems biology, e.g., predicting disease pathways by mining graphs from genomics and proteomics co-expression networks. A second outcome of this research is an interactive pattern mining framework using subgraph sampling where user feedback guides updates of the sampling distribution such that subsequent sampling prioritizes patterns that are considered \"interesting\" to the user. A third outcome is a subgraph sampling method that uses a game theoretic mechanism to design a subgraph evolution model for prediction tasks (such as link prediction) in dynamic networks. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Availability of tools for mining large graphs enables the opportunity to build network biomarkers, which are novel signatures for disease diagnosis and risk factor analysis. A sampling based interactive pattern system is instrumental to mine \"interesting\" associations between diseases and medicines from numerous hidden datasets that are currently unexplored in many hospitals and health clinics.

During these tasks, the forces applied by the robot to the body of the human client (care recipient) are of central importance. Yet robots are currently ignorant of what forces are appropriate for common tasks, and what forces are appropriate when making contact with different locations on the client's body. In this project, the PI's goal is to endow assistive robots with the ability to use appropriate forces when haptically interacting with people. To this end, he will capture and statistically model the forces applied when a person performs assistive tasks for him or herself, or provides care to another person. He will enable robots to intelligently regulate the forces they apply when performing assistive tasks, so that the applied forces are comparable to those used during human-human interactions. And he will enable clients to effectively control the forces applied by a robot during assistive tasks. Throughout the research, the PI will conduct experiments to test relevant hypotheses: That the type of task and the pose of the tool relative to the client's body are highly predictive of the force applied by a human caregiver; That when performing tasks on a mannequin, the robot will successfully emulate the forces observed during human-human interaction; That when the robot applies force to the client's body, the client will prefer that the robot use knowledge of the task and the pose of the tool to interpret user commands rather than a constant mapping. Because a person's ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) is highly predictive of his or her ability to live independently, the work will focus on four representative ADL tasks that require contact with the client's head: feeding a person yogurt, wiping a person's face, brushing a person's hair, and shaving a person with an electric razor. Project outcomes will include a system that enables a PR2 robot from Willow Garage to assist people with severe physical disabilities with these four tasks; the PR2 will be modified to have force-torque sensors at its wrists, specialized tools, and a Kinect 3D sensor on its head.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This research will begin to endow robots with a crucial form of \"common sense\" while quantitatively analyzing and synthesizing haptic interaction in the context of humans' most basic needs. It will also lead to a better understanding of human-robot interaction when the robot initiates contact with the user, and will contribute to data-driven methods for intelligent control. The PI will publish extensively and will release open source code, so that the work can catalyze progress towards robots that could empower millions of people to live more independently with a higher quality of life. The PI will directly involve people with disabilities in the research, and will actively engage the broader community by participating in events such as the RESNA conferences and the Atlanta Abilities Expo.

A VM is high-level software designed to emulate a computer's hardware. In the traditional usage model, security solutions are placed in a VM layer, which has complete control of the system resources. The guest operating system (OS) is considered to be easily compromised by malware and runs unaware of virtualization. The cost of this approach is the semantic gap problem, which hinders the development and widespread deployment of virtualization-based security solutions: there is significant difference between the state observed by the guest OS (high level semantic information) and by the VM (low level semantic information). The guest OS works on abstractions such as processes and files, while the VM can only see lower-level abstractions, such as CPU and main memory. To obtain information about the guest OS state these virtualization solutions use a technique called introspection, by which the guest OS state is inspected from the outside (VM layer), usually by trying build a map of the OS layout to an area of memory where these solutions can analyze it. We propose a new way to perform introspection, by having the guest OS, traditionally unaware of virtualization, actively collaborate with a VM layer underneath it by requesting services and communicating data and information as equal peers in different levels of abstraction. Our approach allows for stronger and more fine-grained and flexible security approaches to be developed and it is no less secure than the traditional model, as introspection tools also depend on the OS data and code to be untampered to report correct results.<br\/><br\/><br\/>We will design, implement and make available to the research community this collaborative architecture between a guest OS and a VM layer and employ such architecture to counter various types of kernel-level malware. The goal is to increase the cost for attackers by refining trust\/integrity values for subjects and objects at OS\/VM layers by leveraging social trust. In this architecture guest OS and a VM actively collaborate requesting services and exchanging data and information through special instructions protected from tampering. This will open up possibilities for malware analysis and defense that are not currently possible (due to the semantic gap problem) including, preventing the actions from privacy-invasion malware like keyloggers, mitigating certain types of DoS attacks in the kernel and return-oriented rootkits, increasing the costs for attackers by leveraging social trust to refine integrity levels and restrict systems resources based on them, just to name a few. This research will also lead to the creation of a cyber security laboratory at Bowdoin, a liberal arts college located in Maine.","title":"CAREER: Bridging the Semantic Gap in Virtualization-based Security Solutions via Collaboration between Guest OS and Virtual Machine","awardID":"1149730","effectiveDate":"2012-03-01","expirationDate":"2017-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"8060","name":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace"}}],"PIcoPI":[502211],"PO":["564388"]},"187900":{"abstract":"This project, investigating active building facades that proactively contribute to energy conservation by changing their opacity and air permeability as a function of environmental and user parameters, promises to contribute strongly to both the cyber and physical sciences.

Most MMOs that have been studied, such as World of Warcraft and EverQuest, evaluate trust and collaboration of players engaged in battles or battle planning, rather than peaceful and constructive purposes. This research employs a well-established but rather unique game that primarily focuses on a wide array of social challenges and tests. It is called \"A Tale in the Desert\" (ATITD), in which each player controls the avatar of an ancient Egyptian. ATITD is the ideal choice for this research because of the strong social aspect inherent in the game. <br\/><br\/>Both because the game creators have agreed to cooperate, and because ATITD incorporates databases such as a constantly updated census and extensive information about all players and their overlapping group memberships, the research will have access to fine grained data of players' actions, chats, and memberships in guilds, marriages and bureaucracies. Starting with an initial set of hypotheses of what data will be analyzed, the research team will then able to iteratively choose more data on the basis of early discoveries.

Of particular interest will be to learn if the psychological factors predict how well individuals interact with other players in the game. Game play data will be analyzed to identify specific behavioral patterns related to the central themes of trust and collaboration, and, conversely, betrayal and competition.

Getting scalable performance (for example, eight times speedup in program execution time on an eight-core processor) is a challenging task even for experienced software developers. This is because parallel programs can suffer from performance problems that either do not exist in sequential applications or that are aggravated by parallel execution. Also, power consumption of manycore applications is a crucial factor limiting their widespread adoption. Unfortunately, analyzing manycore applications for performance and power using just software tools presents challenges due to programs written in multiple languages and source files, libraries in binary-only form, and so on. An efficient hardware-software framework, that can offer insight into performance and power profiles of software execution and subsequently facilitate remediation mechanisms to overcome the observed program bottlenecks, would be a valuable step toward realizing the promise of manycore computing. <br\/><br\/>This research project explores a transformative hardware-software cooperative solution, where the software receives an introspective look into the hardware behavior and dynamically deploys remediation mechanisms to boost performance and lower the power consumption in manycore applications. This hardware-software approach is drastically different from the conventional hardware-level optimization techniques that can no longer automatically guarantee performance scalability, given the increasing diversity and complexity of manycore applications. The outcomes of this project can be used both in software development and education to more precisely understand the manycore application behavior. On a broader level, this introspective framework can boost programmer productivity by offering fast and more accurate feedback about the program execution, and effectively improving the software development cycle.","title":"CAREER:An Introspective Architecture for Manycore Performance and Power Debugging","awardID":"1149557","effectiveDate":"2012-03-15","expirationDate":"2017-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7798","name":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":[502137],"PO":["366560"]},"189282":{"abstract":"The University of Maryland, Baltimore County will gather data about the status of Computer Science education in Maryland high schools and build relationships among high school teachers, community college and university faculty, and state education administrators to facilitate and increase state-level support for lasting improvements to computing education. Despite the overall success of the K-12 education system in Maryland, opportunities to study computer science vary tremendously among the 24 school systems and approximately 200 high schools in the state. This disparity can be attributed to several factors, including the lack of a state-mandated computer science high school graduation requirement, the fact that there is no state-required teacher certification in the discipline, the absence of a standardized computer science curriculum, and barriers to entry for girls and underrepresented minorities.<br\/><br\/>In this CE21 Planning project, the interdisciplinary team at UMBC will focus on two main goals: (1) performing an assessment of the current state of high school computer science in each of the 24 Maryland school systems and (2) increasing knowledge about national issues associated with computer science education among high school and state administrators in Maryland, through state-wide summit meetings for teachers, administrators, and higher education faculty.

AFM based nano-interrogation includes, topographic imaging where one is interested in recreating an image of a sample, and material characterization where one wishes to determine intrinsic material properties. The primary drawback of AFMs is their low speed especially when interrogating soft matter, e.g., polymers and biological samples. This research involves the study of advanced signal processing algorithms that will allow simultaneous topographic imaging and materials characterization at ultra-high speeds and high fidelity. This will significantly accelerate the knowledge discovery process in domains such as material science, where the focus is often on fast evaluation of new materials. The investigator will promote cross-fertilization of ideas between the signal processing and the AFM communities by organizing joint workshops. The findings will be integrated into the curriculum via lab components and modules.<br\/><br\/>The AFM uses a cantilever with a sharp tip that deflects based on inter-atomic forces; interrogation is performed by sensing and interpreting this deflection signal. This research focuses on the dynamic mode operation (the preferred mode for interrogating soft material), where the cantilever is typically excited sinusoidally and gently taps the medium. Current methods work by analyzing the steady state cantilever trajectory and are fundamentally limited in speed by the time-constants of the cantilever dynamics. This research will study order-of-magnitude improvements in speed by leveraging (a) the systems viewpoint and (b) newer AFM techniques such as multi-frequency excitation. Signal processing algorithms for simultaneously detecting topographic features and\/or material property changes will be studied and exhaustively tested on experimental data.","title":"CAREER: Joint Topographic Imaging and Materials Characterization using Atomic Force Microscopy - a Systems Approach","awardID":"1149860","effectiveDate":"2012-03-01","expirationDate":"2017-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7797","name":"COMM & INFORMATION FOUNDATIONS"}}],"PIcoPI":["550838"],"PO":["564898"]},"187196":{"abstract":"Scholars have observed that online news and political talk have the potential to promote belief in false or misleading factual claims, frequently attributing this to distinctive characteristics of the Internet such as the absence of gatekeepers, the freedom to screen out disagreeable evidence, and personalization systems that shield news consumers from uncomfortable truths. However, these mechanisms are largely speculative, and do not align well with existing data. This project moves toward a theoretically grounded and empirically tested understanding of political misperceptions in the Internet era. <br\/><br\/>Hypotheses focus both on broad effects associated with use of online news media, and on the mechanisms through which these effects occur. Specifically, a series of media-effects hypotheses address the prevalence and consequences (1) of partisan bias in media exposure decisions, (2) of the use of social media as a source of political news, and (3) of automated (and often invisible) personalization technologies that shape what online news consumers see. A second more nuanced set of predictions concerns how these technologies could lead individuals to be more likely to accept as true inaccurate political information. These hypotheses link the attributes of the technologies in question with established theoretical work on processing fluency, affect, and biased assimilation. <br\/><br\/>To test the hypotheses, the study will pair multi-wave surveys of representative samples of Americans with a series of controlled experiments designed to evaluate the specific mechanisms theorized. A three-wave survey will be conducted in year one, and a two-wave survey in year five, corresponding with U.S. Presidential elections. Measuring respondents' use of various online political news sources and services in early waves, and assessing respondents' store of political knowledge and misperceptions in later waves will provide clear evidence concerning the consequences of using these Internet technologies. The first survey will also include an embedded experiment in order to test the influence of processing fluency in the field. A series of interrelated experiments will be conducted in the intervening years. Year two will focus on testing the influence of metacognitive experiences, such as processing fluency, on the acceptance of false information and factual corrections. In year three the emphasis will be on affect, testing the influence of emotional responses to political claims on individuals' assessments. Year four experiments will focus on biased assimilation as it informs credibility effects, and on the relative importance of institutional trust and individual judgment on participants' beliefs. <br\/><br\/>The datasets will be shared with students and other scholars, further enhancing the impact of the research endeavor. A new undergraduate course, intended to help students become more informed consumers of political information, will be based on the theoretical and empirical work coming out of this research. Public outreach, communicating key lessons concerning the sources and remedies of political misperceptions to journalists and the broader public, as well as publications in scientific venues, will raise awareness of effective strategies for assessing political information.","title":"CAREER: Information Misperceptions in the Internet Era","awardID":"1149599","effectiveDate":"2012-03-01","expirationDate":"2017-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["145884"],"PO":["564456"]},"187263":{"abstract":"The development of robots that work cooperatively with people is of critical importance for industries as diverse as manufacturing, medicine, healthcare, military, and consumer products.
