The approach is to design new architectures for domain-specific modeling tools in order to permit feedback from analysis, validation, and verification engines to influence how CPSs are designed. This project involves new research into the integration of existing, heterogeneous modeling languages in order to address problems in CPS design, rather than a single language for all CPS. Since many tools for analysis, validation, and verification focus on at most two of the three major components of CPS (communication, computation, and control), new paradigms in modeling are used to integrate tools early in the design process. The algorithms and software developed in this project run validation and verification tools on models, and then close the loop by using the tool outputs to automatically modify the system models.<br\/><br\/>The satisfaction of design requirements in CPSs is critical for tomorrow's societal technologies such as smart buildings, home healthcare, and water management. Among the most compelling design requirements are those of safety, and CPSs for autonomous vehicles exemplify this well. By involving a full-sized autonomous vehicle in this project, the validation and verification of safety requirements is tied to a concrete platform that is broadly understood. By involving students in the design of behaviors of the vehicle, the project exposes scientists and engineers of tomorrow to societal-scale problems, and tools to address them.","title":"CAREER: Domain-Specific Modeling Techniques for Cyber-Physical Systems","awardID":"1253334","effectiveDate":"2013-05-01","expirationDate":"2018-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7918","name":"CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS)"}}],"PIcoPI":["565273"],"PO":["564778"]},"202797":{"abstract":"Abstract: RouteViews is a system for systematically collecting data on the routes (the paths by which data gets from point A to point B) used by Internet traffic.

However, the coupled component of these simulation workflows need to interact and exchange significant amounts of data at runtime, and the data often has to be transformed as it flows from source to destination. As the volumes and generation rates of this data grow, the costs (latencies and energy) associated with extracting this data and transporting it for coupling, transformation and analysis have become the dominating overheads and are dictating the level of performance and productivity that can be achieved.<br\/><br\/>The goal of this project is to address these challenges and to develop conceptual solutions as well as a software framework that can enable the large-scale data-intensive simulations. Our approach is based on the premise that given the large data volumes and associated costs, data will have to be largely processed online, ?in-situ? and ?in-transit? while it is staged using resources within the computational platform, and the programming and runtime system must provide abstractions and mechanisms that facilitate such data processing.

For example, in a brief glance at an image, people reflexively classify the objects in it in terms of the categories they belong to--people, animals, tools, and other significant classes. This allows us to understand the objects' meaning in the image, for example understanding that a scene with many pieces of food might be a dinner table. Because even modern computer vision systems can't make such a classification, they can't automatically detect when an object in a scene doesn't belong, that is, when it is abnormal relative to the categories present in the scene. Detecting such \"oddball\" or atypical objects is essential to understanding visual scenes, because objects that don't belong are often the ones that play the most important role and require immediate action (like a cat on the dinner table). Studies of human subjects have shown that humans are indeed especially adept at detecting atypical items, which often draw our visual attention even before we become consciously aware of them.<br\/><br\/>This project aims at developing algorithmic techniques to endow computer visions systems with the same ability. By adapting modern vision techniques to mimic the way human observers classify visual atypicality, researchers will develop computer systems that can examine an image and automatically detect abnormal objects, as well as identifying the nature of the abnormality and quantifying the degree of abnormality. The project involves a collaboration among researchers at multiple universities and multiple scientific specialties, including both computer vision and human vision. The result will be a new and useful class of computer vision techniques that can be applied to visual image understanding in many contexts.","title":"RI: Small: Collaborative Research: Detecting Abnormalities in Images","awardID":"1218683","effectiveDate":"2013-05-15","expirationDate":"2016-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":[518405],"PO":["564318"]},"202817":{"abstract":"Abstract: RouteViews is a system for systematically collecting data on the routes (the paths by which data gets from point A to point B) used by Internet traffic.

The explosion of social media tools such as Facebook, Flickr, and Twitter, along with new developments in machine learning and data mining have produced new types of behavioral data for scholars to analyze (Mislove et al., 2007). Significant advances in mathematics, statistics, and computer science have also produced unprecedented opportunities to analyze ?Big? social network data. Social network analysis sits at the cutting edge of social science and also links the social, natural, and computational sciences. Understanding the multi-faceted nature of social networks and their effects on human behavior is one of the grand challenges faced as this project seeks to maximize our investments in scientific research (NSF-ACCI, 2011). However, the community has not seen comparable advances in the management, archiving, and sharing of social network data. This presents a fundamental obstacle to advancing network science across the social, natural, and computational sciences. This proposal seeks to begin to remedy this problem. The data management needs social network scholars are complex. Network data often come from unstructured environments that require researchers to define and describe a set of units or actors (called nodes) and the connections (called edges) between them. Networks might be static or dynamic, include one type of node or multiple node types, and include edges that are uni-directional or bi-directional and weighted or unweighted. In addition, as relationships spread within the network and\/or a network grows, the associated data management, data storage, and analytical memory requirements can grow exponentially. This proposal brings together the social network analysis, information science, computer science, and data archive communities to develop a data infrastructure to support advanced analysis and research on social networks as well as to facilitate data sharing and archiving within this community. The group will address key questions concerning data storage architecture and lifecycle requirements, develop design specifications for creating a sustainable data infrastructure that will be discoverable, searchable, accessible, and usable to the entire research and education community, and initialize a prototype solution based on that plan. Intellectual Merit: The proposed project will bring together the social network analysis community to work with information technology professionals to design a robust data management infrastructure to promote the sharing and interoperability of social network data. Effective data management for social network data amplifies the impact of research by revealing data quality issues early in the data collection process, ensuring that required data is retained and usable throughout the life of a research project. It also facilitates data sharing and reuse. A key to responsible data stewardship is the application and auditing of quality data management policies ? something included in this proposal. Providing a robust infrastructure to store, analyze, curate, share, and manage important social network data will increase researchers? production and provide an unprecedented view of the social world only visible through social network data. Broader Impacts: The project will facilitate data sharing and increase social network data availability while assuring researchers that data management policies are followed. It will help formalize a community of network data experts that will begin developing best practices for the community. Availability of data particularly benefits early-stage researchers, and researchers at diverse institutions. Widespread availability of data facilitates citizen science and the integration of science and teaching at all levels of education. Managed data sharing is critical to the multi disciplinary research to answer the critical challenges facing society today. It would be difficult to overstate the importance of social network analysis to better understand human networks and social behavior.","title":"CIF21 DIBBs: Designing the Roadmap for Social Network Data Management","awardID":"1255826","effectiveDate":"2013-05-01","expirationDate":"2014-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7726","name":"DATANET"}}],"PIcoPI":["557802"],"PO":["565292"]},"196826":{"abstract":"Harvey Mudd College will adapt exemplary educational resources to create MyCS, a CS curriculum whose goal is to develop positive computational identities among middle-school students. A positive computational identity subsumes self-efficacy, enjoyment, and future engagement with creating computation. The project's approach existing pedagogical resources into three distinct MyCS variations. Inspired by UCLA's high-school course, Exploring Computer Science (ECS), the first variation broadly explores computational concepts and skills. The second variation is a depth-based development of programming skills through Scratch and web technologies, adapting several successful middle- and high-school courses. The third variation is a hybrid that punctuates skill-building in Scratch and web programming with curricular breaks contextualizing those skills. The project investigates how teachers and students respond to these different MyCS realizations. The project team will compare results within and among the primary partnering school district, Pomona Unified in Pomona, CA, along with our two secondary partnering districts, Lihue, HI and San Bernardino, CA. In order to maximize the number of students reached, the project focuses on middle-school teacher development through summer workshops and academic-year support.<br\/><br\/>Computation has become a crucial component of every modern endeavor. It has not, however, become a component of every modern student's identity. That is, the number of students who feel that \"computation is something that people like me create\" lags significantly behind the demand for computational creativity, both now and in the foreseeable future. Because of their pivotal role in early identity-formation, the middle-school years provide a window of opportunity to build a positive computational identity and to prime the pump for the ambitious CS10k project. To that end, this project develops, deploys, and assesses several variations of a middle-years computer-science curriculum, MyCS. The project team will build MyCS communities within targeted schools in three districts, each with a large majority of students from a distinct group underrepresented in STEM fields. Two key benefits will result. First, those communities will continue to develop computationally confident students even after the project concludes. Second, assessments will cull less effective variations and facets of MyCS, leaving a ready-to-go curriculum that will succeed in further regional deployment and will be prepared for larger-scale vetting, national trials, and broader adaptations.","title":"CER: MyCS - Middle Years Computer Science","awardID":"1240939","effectiveDate":"2013-05-15","expirationDate":"2016-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7382","name":"Computing Ed for 21st Century"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1104","name":"Division of UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION","abbr":"DUE"},"pgm":{"id":"1793","name":"MSP-OTHER AWARDS"}}],"PIcoPI":[527995,527996],"PO":["560704"]},"198806":{"abstract":"This award is for addressing the problem of the increasing amount of cryospheric data being generated at an unprecedented rate, and in particular, for the discoverability and higher-level data analytics such as anomaly detection in these big data flows.

Three main areas of the study are: (1) adaptive neighborhood-based thresholding in both space and time; (2) compressive-domain pattern detection and change analysis; and (3) hybrid condensation of multi-modal, multi-scale cryospheric data. The techniques and software developed will be shared publicly via the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) existing support platform, and publicized via scientific publications and presentations at top-tier conferences such as the America Geophysical Union meetings.

For example, in a brief glance at an image, people reflexively classify the objects in it in terms of the categories they belong to--people, animals, tools, and other significant classes. This allows us to understand the objects' meaning in the image, for example understanding that a scene with many pieces of food might be a dinner table. Because even modern computer vision systems can't make such a classification, they can't automatically detect when an object in a scene doesn't belong, that is, when it is abnormal relative to the categories present in the scene. Detecting such \"oddball\" or atypical objects is essential to understanding visual scenes, because objects that don't belong are often the ones that play the most important role and require immediate action (like a cat on the dinner table). Studies of human subjects have shown that humans are indeed especially adept at detecting atypical items, which often draw our visual attention even before we become consciously aware of them.<br\/><br\/>This project aims at developing algorithmic techniques to endow computer visions systems with the same ability. By adapting modern vision techniques to mimic the way human observers classify visual atypicality, researchers will develop computer systems that can examine an image and automatically detect abnormal objects, as well as identifying the nature of the abnormality and quantifying the degree of abnormality. The project involves a collaboration among researchers at multiple universities and multiple scientific specialties, including both computer vision and human vision. The result will be a new and useful class of computer vision techniques that can be applied to visual image understanding in many contexts.","title":"RI: Small: Collaborative Research: Detecting Abnormalities in Images","awardID":"1218872","effectiveDate":"2013-05-15","expirationDate":"2016-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":[518507,518508],"PO":["564318"]},"208360":{"abstract":"This award supports a Future Internet Architecture (FIA) principal investigator (PI) meeting in March 2013.

Alternatively, supercapacitors (SCs) have cycle lives on the order of millions and a life span of 20 years or more.

As these systems continue to expand rapidly in capability, their computational energy expenditure has skyrocketed, requiring elaborate cooling facilities, which themselves consume significant energy. The need for energy-efficient resource management is thus paramount. Moreover, these systems frequently experience degraded performance and high power consumption due to circumstances that change unpredictably, such as thermal hotspots caused by load imbalances or sudden machine failures. As the complexity of systems grows, so does the importance of making system operation robust against these uncertainties. The goal of this award is to study stochastic-based models, metrics, and algorithmic strategies for deriving resource allocations that are energy-efficient and robust. The research focus is on deriving stochastic robustness and energy models from real-world data from heterogeneous computing machines; applying stochastic models for resource management strategies that co-optimize performance, robustness, computation energy, and cooling energy; developing novel schemes for real-time thermal modeling; and driving and validating the research with feedback collected from real-world petascale systems (Yellowstone at National Center of Atmospheric Research and Jaguar at Oak Ridge National Lab) and terascale systems (Colorado State University's ISTeC cluster and clusters at Oak Ridge National Lab).<br\/><br\/>The research is expected to realize resource management strategies that are resilient to various sources of uncertainty at run-time while also considering the dynamics of temperature variations and cooling capacity to meet performance guarantees with unprecedented gains in system energy-efficiency in high performance computing environments. By lowering the energy costs and impact of uncertainties associated with computing, this research will ultimately render high performance computing accessible to a wider population of researchers and scientific problems. In the long term, the theoretical foundations and tools that emerge from this research will play a vital role in achieving the grand promise of sustainable computing at extreme scales within realistic power budgets. The broader impacts of the research include: incorporate research results into all levels of teaching, including graduate, undergraduate, secondary, and even elementary education; increase participation by underrepresented groups; and foster close ties with industry and government labs to transfer the developed knowledge quickly into real-world deployments.","title":"SHF:Medium: Energy Efficient and Stochastically Robust Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Computing","awardID":"1302693","effectiveDate":"2013-05-15","expirationDate":"2016-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7942","name":"HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[542085,542086,542087,542088],"PO":["565272"]},"206673":{"abstract":"This award will support student travel to the 2013 ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI '13), which is being held in Seattle, Washington.

They will improve care outcomes by catching common mistakes, reduce clinician cognitive workload by suppressing false alarms, and streamline and simplify continued care, especially when patients move between different medical facilities. As the penetration of \"smart\" networked medical technology increases, we will see increased problems with cybersecurity of such systems. This project is building the theoretical foundations and software prototypes to enable safe and secure real-time medical coordination in the presence of not only random faults, but actively malicious actors.<br\/><br\/>Medical and cyber-physical systems rely on real-time feedback and control, where microseconds could mean the difference between correct functionality and a fault, and ultimately, in medical systems, life and death. Since it is not possible to count on technology functioning flawlessly, especially with intelligent active attackers who may have access to medical devices or the network through which they communicate, this project seeks to develop requirements and best practices for \"optimistic real-time\" safety-critical systems, with built-in fallback to safe states if timing or performance guarantees cannot be met. The software and communication protocols will allow for global-scale medical systems, with real-time care independent of the location of the clinician or the patient, minimizing the chance of malfunction as a result of natural faults or tampering.

The first workshop was held in May 2012 in San Jose, California and was sponsored by the National Science Foundation along with a few industry sponsors. Subsequent meetings followed, and a second workshop held in December 2012 in Pune, India.

A variety of new techniques and technologies have emerged to address these challenges. A big data benchmark could, indeed, be specified with the following components: (i) a definition for a synthetic benchmark dataset with a well-defined and well-specified data generation procedure; (ii) a representative workload for big data applications; and (iii) a set of metrics, run rules and full disclosure reports for fair comparisons among technologies and platforms. These results would then form the basis of the BigData Top100 List.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The first two WBDB meetings have had a total of about 100 (invited) attendees from about 60 different organizations from industry and academia. The BigData Top100 List initiative was officially introduced at a dedicated session at the Strata Conference in Santa Clara, on February 28th, 2013.

The problem is not just that street-level accessibility affects where and how people travel in cities but also that there are few, if any, mechanisms to determine accessible areas of a city a priori. Traditionally, sidewalk assessment has been conducted via in-person street audits, which are labor intensive and costly, or via citizen call-in reports, which are done on a reactive basis. And while efforts exist for visualizing the walk-ability, bike-ability, and availability of public transport in cities, there are no analogous efforts for accessibility. Thus, wheelchair users, for example, often avoid going to new areas of a city where they don't know about accessible routes. The PI plans to address this problem by means of a two-pronged approach in which he will first develop scalable data collection methods for acquiring sidewalk accessibility information using a combination of crowd-sourcing, computer vision, and online map imagery; he will then use the new data to develop and evaluate a novel set of navigation and map tools for accessibility. To these ends, the PI and his team will collect and analyze interview and survey data both from mobility impaired persons and from ADA streetscape design experts, and will seek to understand how people with mobility impairments can make use of interactive mapping information to enhance mobility. They will study methods for efficiently and effectively crowd-sourcing map labeling tasks, evaluating existing approaches empirically and designing novel, more effective approaches. They will develop new computer vision algorithms for the analysis of street scenes, which will be used to help scale the data collection by focusing human labeling efforts on locations that are most likely to contain significant problems. And they will design, implement and evaluate new accessible-aware map-based tools to aid people with mobility impairments in navigating their cities. As appropriate for each phase of the research, user evaluations will include both lab and field studies.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Roughly 30.6 million individuals in the United States have physical disabilities that affect their ambulatory activities, and nearly half of these individuals report using an assistive aid such as a wheelchair, cane, crutches, or walker. The outcomes from this research will have a significant impact on the ability of these Americans to travel independently, by transforming the ways in which accessibility information is collected and visualized for every sidewalk, street, and building fa\u00e7ade in America. Project outcomes will include a publicly accessible web site where both the labeled data collected during this work and the new prototype tools developed will be made available for general use. Furthermore, the PI and Co-PI will advise and mentor both graduate and undergraduate students throughout the course of the project, including two PhDs and two MS students who will obtain a cross-disciplinary education in human-computer interaction and computer vision.","title":"HCC: Medium: Combining Crowdsourcing and Computer Vision for Street-level Accessibility","awardID":"1302338","effectiveDate":"2013-05-01","expirationDate":"2017-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[541954,541955],"PO":["565227"]}}
