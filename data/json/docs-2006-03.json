{"109516":{"abstract":"A highly publicized report by the American Cancer Society noted that cancer has surpassed heart disease to become the number one killer of adults under the age of 85 in the United States today. At the top of the list was lung cancer, a disease that is eminently preventable. Addressing public health threats like cancer are acute, system-wide challenges that would benefit from network-centric approaches. For example, when the tobacco research community realized it had taken over a decade to discover that they had already collected substantial empirical evidence, distributed across its network of tobacco researchers, indicating that 'light' (low-tar\/low-nicotine brands) cigarettes reduced neither exposure to nor risk of cancer, researchers began to understand the importance of effectively sharing resources and information across the entire community. In response, government agencies involved in public health have made a substantial foundational investment in developing a digital government cyberinfrastructure--Tobacco Systems integration Grid (TobacSIG)--to enable collaboration within the Tobacco Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Evaluation Network (TSEEN). While such an underlying cyberinfrastructure is a prerequisite, delays in discoveries (such as the carcinogenic effects of 'light' cigarette mentioned above) have prompted the TSEEN community to underscore the need for social network referral tools as a crucial component of any effort to enhance the efficacy of their collaboration system.","title":"Collaborative Research: Social Networking Tools to Enable Collaboration in the Tobacco Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Evaluation Network (TSEEN)","awardID":"0534909","effectiveDate":"2006-03-15","expirationDate":"2011-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1706","name":"DIGITAL GOVERNMENT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["519649"],"PO":["543481"]},"110660":{"abstract":"North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NCAT) proposes a novel, 2-way collaboration between HBCUs and research universities in order to increase the number of African Americans who obtain graduate degrees and enter faculty and research careers in computing.

Mark, University of Texas at Austin <br\/><br\/><br\/>The goal of this project is to produce better interactive 3D graphics -- that is, to synthesize images that are indistinguishable from the real world and to generate these images rapidly enough that users can interact with the computer-generated world. Realistic computer-generated images are needed by applications such as emergency and military training, e-commerce, education, and entertainment. Although real-time 3D graphics technology has improved enormously over the past twenty years, the images from today's systems are still not fully realistic, and the goal of realism is in fact unattainable with current system designs due to fundamental limitations of the<br\/>technology used in today's systems.<br\/><br\/>This research is exploring a new, ground-up system design for both software and hardware that overcomes current limitations to enable realistic real-time graphics. The new system is organized around the ray tracing visibility algorithm, which does not suffer from the limitations imposed by using the Z-buffer. Ray tracing has traditionally been considered impractical for real-time systems because previous approaches have been unable to efficiently support dynamic and deformable objects that are needed by most applications. The new system overcomes this restriction with a novel approach to ray tracing that integrates the two parts of the system that were previously separated: scene management and visibility computations. In turn, this tight integration requires that the two-part hardware architecture of today's systems (the central processing unit (CPU)+graphics) be replaced with a single, unified hardware architecture. This new hardware architecture combines the parallelism of today's graphics processors with the flexible programming model of today's CPUs. This new hardware architecture also has the potential to provide better performance for a wide variety of applications beyond 3D graphics. In conjunction with this research, the investigator is training students and other researchers to understand how to design and analyze this new type of system.","title":"CAREER: A systems approach to real-time graphics on single-chip highly-programmable hardware","awardID":"0546236","effectiveDate":"2006-03-01","expirationDate":"2010-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7453","name":"GRAPHICS & VISUALIZATION"}}],"PIcoPI":[295060],"PO":["565157"]},"111442":{"abstract":"CAREER: Passive Vision -- What Can Be Learned by a Stationary Observer<br\/><br\/>Passive Vision is the analysis of video from a camera that is not moving. Many cameras do not move, and continually watch a specific scene -- an ATM, an airport security desk, or a traffic intersection -- for months or years. Much as Active Vision (the ability to intentionally control camera motion) simplifies problems in structure from motion, Passive Vision simplifies statistical image analysis by observing statistics of the same scene for very long time periods.<br\/><br\/>This project develops a framework to study the statistics of fixed-viewpoint video. General statistics of natural video underlie current models of image and video compression and provide a statistical context for general image processing. But for video taken from a single viewpoint, the same analytic tools find much more specific statistical correlations, and these correlations relate to important scene features. For example, image regions that share geometric features such as surface normal and depth have a correlated responses to natural lighting changes. A tree waving in the wind tends to move all at the same time.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, automated tools that develop statistics of specific video sequences, accumulated over time, promise to ground a number of probabilistic algorithms in surveillance. Surprisingly simple, local statistics of image derivatives find anomalous objects in scenes with significant background motions and find complicated patterns of motions of objects in a scene.

Changes may require modifying dozens or hundreds of software implementations deployed on hundreds of millions of computers. Other than sheer scale, a major reason that these changes are difficult to deploy is a high degree of coupling between applications and the underlying network protocols and their semantics. This coupling is evident for an important class of network applications that function primarily as data transfer agents (e.g., email, file transfer, web, and so on). These applications typically bundle the functions of content negotiation---naming objects, negotiating common languages, handling cookies, etc.---and data transfer---the process of actually sending the data across the network. The result of this coupling is that in order to deploy a novel data transfer mechanism, one must modify every application that makes use of the network.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit:<br\/>The Principal Investigator proposes to design and implement a novel data-oriented transfer layer that performs data transfer on behalf of applications. The transfer layer will be a narrow waist at which to introduce new mechanisms for data transfer, and have them immediately benefit all applications using the transfer layer. By serving as a locus for modifications, the transfer layer will also facilitate the adoption of changes within the underlying network. A new transfer-layer module will be able to make the network-intensive portion of applications use new network-layer functionality with no application modification.<br\/><br\/>As a first use of the transfer layer, this project will develop novel techniques for improving the resilience of Internet applications to challenging network environments. These environments are characterized by intermittent connectivity or poor link quality, such as that provided by cheap wireless links or satellites. The techniques developed will be used to create a network that performs drastically better in the face of accidental and malicious failures. The approaches the project will explore include performing transfers by using multiple network paths in parallel, supporting out of band transfers via portable storage, and ensuring that transfers continue to make forward progress in the face of network interruptions. <br\/><br\/>This project will address several major challenges to building and deploying a practical transfer service. The first is the design and evaluation of the interface that the transfer service provides to applications. The design must simultaneously fit naturally into existing and future applications, while not precluding the optimization necessary for its use in a production environment. The second challenge is the development and implementation of a security model that balances the need to provide equivalent or better security while allowing an efficient implementation. The appropriate security model will likely require the development of novel techniques for securely sharing cached data. The third challenge is the design of algorithms to select among the different sources of data that the transfer layer will enable. These algorithms must react to changing network conditions and balance between shared paths with incredibly different performance characteristics.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact:<br\/>Continued evolution is critical for making the Internet and its protocols suitable for more applications, particularly those that require more availability than today's Internet can provide. Improved protocols may also significantly reduce the operational costs associated with managing the Internet. This research may significantly accelerate the rate of adoption of new protocols and technologies by providing a narrowed interface on which developers can concentrate, instead of spreading their effort across dozens of different applications. The techniques developed as a part of this research for communication in challenging environments could help improve the availability and reach of the Internet into areas formerly only poorly served by network connectivity. The project will release a freely available reference implementation of the transfer service for others to build upon.<br\/><br\/>The PI will use the framework developed in the course of this research as a central part of an upcoming graduate class at CMU. If successfully deployed, the transfer framework will be used as a vehicle for making course content (slides, notes, assignments, and videos of each lecture) from the PI's classes freely available on the Internet in a way that is accessible to students in underserved areas with poor network connectivity.","title":"CAREER: An Evolvable Architecture for Internet Data Transfer","awardID":"0546551","effectiveDate":"2006-03-01","expirationDate":"2012-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["548263"],"PO":["565090"]},"112444":{"abstract":"This collaborative project, developing a testbed that enables research on understanding and analysis of vulnerabilities of Voice over IP (VoIP), investigates issues related to Quality of Service (QoS) in VoIP, taking into account possible attacks, identity management, spamming, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, 911 emergency management, and high availability.

Despite its magnificent success for certain applications, there are many applications, particularly in delay-constrained and many network scenarios, in which classical<br\/>> information theory has offered fewer insights, or otherwise the available insights have not been fully integrated into existing systems. One of the drawbacks of the classical theory is its reliance on long coding blocklengths. We believe that application of information theory to modern applications can be accelerated by a \"finite blocklength\" information theory that is general enough to handle a wide class of important channel models but not so complex and subtle so as to be essentially unusable by system designers.<br\/>This research centers around activities for developing a general framework of finite blocklength information theory for modern communication systems and networks. The guiding objective is to develop suitable abstractions of communication channels and coding strategies in terms of a single random variable called the mutual information density rate, rather than its expectation. The anticipated abstractions will enable characterization of performance and architectural evaluation by network designers as well as facilitate orders of magnitude speedups in network simulation. The<br\/>technical approach is comprehensive, leveraging theoretical analysis, computer simulation, and testbed experiments. Opportunities for integration of research and education have been identified, and substantial cross-fertilization is expected.","title":"CAREER: Towards a Renassaince in Finite Blocklength Length Information Theory","awardID":"0546618","effectiveDate":"2006-03-01","expirationDate":"2013-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4096","name":"COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7937","name":"NETWORK CODING AND INFO THEORY"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7939","name":"WIRELESS COMM & SIGNAL PROCESS"}}],"PIcoPI":["540625"],"PO":["564924"]},"112477":{"abstract":"This collaborative project, developing a testbed that enables research on understanding and analysis of vulnerabilities of Voice over IP (VoIP), investigates issues related to Quality of Service (QoS) in VoIP, taking into account possible attacks, identity management, spamming, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, 911 emergency management, and high availability.

The complexity such devices is expected to become significant in the near future due to the need for multiple and concurrent biochemical assays on multifunctional and reconfigurable platforms. There is a need to deliver the same level of computer-aided design (CAD) support to the biochip designer that the semiconductor industry now takes for granted. The goal of this project is to develop top-down system-level CAD tools for the synthesis, testing and reconfiguration of electrowetting-based digital microfluidic biochips. These CAD tools will allow designers to harness new technology that is rapidly emerging for integrated biofluidics. <br\/><br\/>The CAD tools being developed as part of this project will allow biochip users to describe biochemical assays at high levels of abstraction. Synthesis tools will then map behavioral descriptions to a droplet-based microfluidic biochip and generate an optimized schedule of assay operations, the binding of assay operations to functional units, and the layout and droplet flow-paths for the biochip. Cost-effective testing techniques are being developed to detect faults after manufacture and during field operation. On-line and off-line reconfiguration techniques, being incorporated in these CAD tools, can easily bypass faults once they are detected. Thus the biochip user can concentrate on the development of the nano- and micro-scale bioassays, leaving assay optimization and implementation details to design automation tools. <br\/><br\/>This project bridges several research communities, e.g., microfluidics, MEMS, electronic design automation, and biochemistry. The results of this project will lead to the development of miniaturized and low-cost biosensors. These sensors will revolutionize data acquisition and analysis for air quality studies and clinical diagnostics, enabling a transformation in environmental monitoring, healthcare, exposure assessment, emergency response, and public policy. The small size and high fault tolerance make these systems ideal for personal samplers, e.g., for clinical diagnostics, and to measure human exposure to air toxins.","title":"Synthesis, Test, and Reconfiguration Techniques for Microfluidics-Based Biochips","awardID":"0541055","effectiveDate":"2006-03-01","expirationDate":"2010-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4710","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["506171"],"PO":["562984"]},"110432":{"abstract":"Spelman College together with Carnegie Mellon University propose an integrated set of three educational programs to broaden the participation of African Americans in computing.

Writing correct software is hard. Our techniques to ensure software reliability<br\/>lag far behind our requirements for more and more complex systems. Unlike for lowlevel correctness requirements (such as correct syntax, or correct use of types), application level properties are currently not specifiable or automatically checkable. Testing remains the dominant methodology to ensure software quality with regard to application level properties, however, it is not exhaustive, and nasty bugs are often exposed post-deployment. Thus, the availability of analyses that can automatically check higher-level properties of large software systems soundly and precisely will mark a major advance in our ability to develop more reliable software. This project leverages recent advances in software verification and explores new ideas to significantly extend the capabilities of modern verification tools to handle larger programs and more complex properties. We contend that the leap to scalably verifying end-to-end properties of software<br\/>will be enabled by novel techniques in modular software verification, over and above existing techniques like model checking, predicate abstraction, and abstraction refinement. While the basic principles of modularity in system verification have been known for decades, they have not been widely adopted in program analysis tools because there is no push-button way to apply them in full generality. We focus on the technical challenges in automating modular verification by studying the following widely occurring verification patterns. Tighter integration of type information in model checking through predicated types. Automatically synthesizing temporal interfaces that specify behavioral requirements. Integration of abstract data types into symbolic reasoning. Automatic parameterized verification through design decomposition. Our research will immediately benefit any large software system where robustness and reliability are pressing concerns; we shall validate our research by verifying end-to-end properties of enterprise applications and high performance servers from which we derived the verification patterns and which are beyond the scope of current tools.","title":"CAREER: Modular Verification of Software","awardID":"0546170","effectiveDate":"2006-03-15","expirationDate":"2012-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}}],"PIcoPI":["460594"],"PO":["564388"]},"110322":{"abstract":"The University of New Mexico (UNM) and Boston University (BU) propose a pilot program that develops curriculum combining Native American culture and art with a high-technology, computer-rich environment as a vehicle to engage Native American students in computer and computational science.

The increase in the number and complexity of DREs strongly motivates the need for more rigorous, repeatable, and cost-effective development techniques. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a number of techniques and artifacts that will facilitate the modeling and analysis of DREs, with the intent of preventing and\/or detecting errors in the early stages of development prior to design, coding, and fabrication. Specifically, we will develop extensions to UML to denote timing information applicable to DREs; develop object analysis patterns for DREs comprising templates for UML diagrams with DRE extensions; and develop timing-based formal specification patterns for specifying critical safety properties of DREs. <br\/>The broader impact of this project is that by bridging informal, commonly-used techniques with rigorous, and more formal techniques, a larger development community is able to build higher quality models and DRE systems. For example, a natural-language front-end will be developed for the formal specifications to make the formal specification patterns more accessible to the broader DRE development community. In order to automatically analyze the UML diagrams, we will extend our previously developed UML formalization framework to automatically generate corresponding formal specifications from the UML diagrams with DRE extensions. These specification can then be analyzed by simulation or model checked for adherence to critical<br\/>properties (specified with the specification patterns). Analysis errors will be visualized in terms of the original UML diagrams, thus facilitating a round-trip engineering approach to UML model creation and refinement. Both the UML and the formal specification patterns will developed based on analyses of projects obtained from industrial partners, thus further ensuring the utility and applicability to industrial projects.","title":"Facilitating the Modeling and Analysis of Distributed Real-time Embedded Systems","awardID":"0541131","effectiveDate":"2006-03-15","expirationDate":"2012-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["543568"],"PO":["564388"]},"112501":{"abstract":"This project, studying new architectural and programming models for the rapid application development of multi-model human computer interfaces for ambient computing devices, aims at establishing a lab that will design and develop the user interface to ubiquitous intelligent devices. With a developmental framework and programming model for integrating and configuring the low-level enabling technologies to produce a desired behavior for a user to interact (e.g., talk) with a computing device in an environment, this work in interactive programming development environments for configuring ambient (intelligent) environments shifts the burden of having to understand how to use advanced technology from the user to the programming environment. The experimental work focuses on the use of Storyboarding, a visual medium for defining scenarios describing the actions of people and expected behavior of intelligent devices in an ambient computing setting. The scenarios then produce the runtime behavior of the devices, providing an environment for end-users to design, test, and evaluate the interfaces to intelligent devices in an ambient computing setting. The approach is expected to increase the accessibility of environment control to general populations of users by replacing explicit programming with an illustrative interface. A visual programming language for scripting ambient computing activities is also contemplated. Computing resources, often embedded in devices like toasters, desks, doors, walls, etc., give the device a sense of intelligence. People interact with these devices explicitly through direct manipulation or implicitly through their mere proximity to the devices. Because these intelligent devices are pervasive and perhaps even invisible to the user, the complexity of designing and developing the user interface presents a major challenge addressed by this research.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: The emerging area of ambient computing, also known as ubiquitous, pervasive, invisible, or calm computing, could become the next wave of computing.

To continue to design such chips effectively, estimating the interference noise generated by large numbers of switching digital blocks has become exceedingly important. Increasing levels of current drawn, higher switching speeds (clock frequencies) and falling supply voltages in new technologies conspire to worsen levels of interference noise and to exacerbate its debilitating impact on system functionality and performance. Interference noise that has not been correctly estimated and contained leads to failed production runs, delays in design turnaround,<br\/>increased development costs and longer times to market. <br\/>In this project, algorithms, methodologies and prototype CAD tools for predicting digital interference noise will be developed. The core of the project is to develop algorithms to extract accurate -- yet computationally-inexpensive -- noise macromodels of large blocks of digital aggressors. The resulting noise<br\/>macromodels will be used to develop a methodology for fast prediction of on-chip interference noise via both power-grid and substrate-coupling mechanisms. Unlike prior attempts, the project unified the prediction of interference noise digital design (e.g., switching noise margin, power\/ground bounce induced delay variations) and for mixed-signal\/analog\/RF design (e.g., interference-induced spurs, SNR degradation and PLL jitter). Because the approach is algorithmically-based and not tied to any particular technology or design style, it is also easily adapted to apply nanoscale devices and mixed-domain systems containing electronics, optics, and MEMS. Thus, the project is expected to have significant broad impact in the general arena of high-performance hardware for communication, computational and sensor systems. The algorithms developed will be disseminated as open-source code, further accelerating and enhancing the project's impact in the technological community.","title":"CAD Algorithms for Automated, Hierarchical, Bottom-Up Abstraction of Large Digital Aggressor Blocks for Supply and Substrate Noise Analysis","awardID":"0541396","effectiveDate":"2006-03-01","expirationDate":"2009-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4710","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["520671"],"PO":["562984"]},"110632":{"abstract":"The project investigates the development of flexible, generic and high-performance data structures for commodity data-parallel architectures.

Computers have recently evolved to the level where they can start being used to model human beings in a simulated environment. One can study virtual human models as opposed to humans themselves, opening the floodgates for new research and discovery that is likely to have a profound effect on everyday lives. Unfortunately, researchers are still severely lacking methods for programming computers to carry out these types of simulations. This proposal is focused on constructing these numerical methods, with a particular focuson those related to human motion.

With such a model, prosthetics and other exoskeleton-type equipment to help paraplegics and quadriplegics walk could be tested and refined without endangering humans. However, to enable these technologies, significant advances in the algorithms used to simulate the human musculoskeletal system and control its locomotion are needed.

The on-chip interconnection network will be a key factor in determining the performance and power consumption of these multi-core devices. Packet switched interconnection networks or Network-on-Chip (NoC) has emerged as an attractive alternative to traditional bus-based architectures for satisfying the communication requirements of these multi-core SoC architectures. The key challenge in NoC design is to produce a complex, high performance and low energy architecture under tight time to market requirements. The NoC architectures would support the communication demands of hundreds of cores under stringent performance constraints. In addition to the complexity, the NoC designers would also have to contend with the physical challenges of design in nanoscale technologies. The NoC design problem would entail a joint optimization of the thermal profile of the system-level floorplan and power consumption of the network. All these factors coupled with the requirement for short turn around times raises the need for an intellectual property (IP) re-use methodology that is well supported with design and optimization techniques, and performance evaluation models.<br\/><br\/>The project accomplishes the following three tasks for the IP re-use based methodology for design of NoC architectures: (i) Development of design and optimization techniques for NoC architectures: The techniques support design of NoC architectures with both regular and custom topologies. The design techniques address the issue of thermal floorplanning, high power consumption, and long signal propagation delays that arise in nanoscale technologies. (ii) Development of a customizable IP block for NoC router: The customizable features of the router architecture permit its integration into NoC design flows for both regular and application-specific topologies with multiple levels of quality-of-service. (iii) Development of performance and power consumption models for the customizable router: The models that are at various levels of abstraction enable design space exploration, optimization and performance verification of NoC architectures. The education contributions of the project include development of catalogue of course projects on NoC, recruitment of undergraduate students for graduate school, technology transfer through industry focused curriculum, and increased participation of under-represented groups. Intellectual merit: Multi-core SoC devices are the only solution to the power consumption roadblocks of technology scaling. The project overcomes a key challenge to the successful realization of multi-core SoC devices in deep nanoscale technologies. The project also achieves an appreciable increase in design productivity by enabling the migration of VLSI design to the next higher level of abstraction, namely the system level. Broad impact: SoC architectures that are enabled by the project are the essential component of embedded devices which have permeated through all facets of human activities. Therefore, the project significantly benefits every interface of human-computer interaction including medical instruments, cell phones, automobile controllers, entertainment units, assistive devices and so on.

The benefits of virtualization (e.g. generality, portability, extensibility, and simplifying application debugging, deployment, and development) however, come at a cost in performance since the number, depth, and complexity of layers is increasing. Deep layering introduces additional levels of indirection, additional redundant computation, and increasingly inefficient cross-layer communication. To reduce the overhead of virtualization many developers of high-end systems and services attempt to specialize the layers to the needs of the application by removing or penetrating the layer interfaces. The application and system code are then co-mingled and optimized together, thereby improving performance at the expense of generality, portability, and extensibility. This specialization, at present, is performed almost exclusively by hand in an ad-hoc fashion. The project will develop new methods and approaches to automate and advance the specialization process under programmatic control through Vertical Integration of Virtualization layers (VIVA). <br\/><br\/>The key to the proposed approach is to exploit the increasingly popular trend of isolating entire application, middleware, and operating system (OS) stacks using virtual machine monitors (VMMs) so that each execution instance can employ the layered software it uniquely requires. VIVA takes advantage of the isolation that such systems provide to aggressively customize and optimize all layers of a system according to the requirements of an executing application eliminating all services that are unused by the program, e.g., OS services for resource sharing and security. Moreover, since program behavior changes over time and is increasingly data driven, the techniques to be developed will be both dynamic and adaptive.","title":"CAREER: VIVA - Vertically Integrated VirtualizAtion: Automatic, Full System, Specialization for High-End Computing","awardID":"0546737","effectiveDate":"2006-03-01","expirationDate":"2011-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["561463"],"PO":["535244"]},"110424":{"abstract":"The American Indian Science and Engineering Society project (AISES BPC) proposes a three year demonstration project to broaden the participation of American Indian\/Alaskan Native (AI\/AN) students in the computing.

Such models are especially useful when modeling large networks, as it is often impossible to obtain a complete, probabilistic description of the states for all the users in the network. Instead of enumerating all possible interactions among users and their corresponding state transitions, the fluid-based approach, resting on probabilistic limit theories such as the law of large numbers, allows us to describe the average macroscopic behavior of network dynamics in terms of a set of relatively simple and deterministic difference\/differential equations with averaged quantities. Since the fluid modeling approach offers intuitive and manageable solutions to describing the dynamics of large networks, it has been widely used for a variety of important networking problems including congestion control, stability analysis, optimization-based techniques, and peer-to-peer networks.<br\/>However, the fluid modeling approach has fundamental limitations; it is valid only when the system is scaled as required by the underlying theory. For other types of scaling, the fluid-based<br\/>approach may break down and incorrectly predict even first-order system dynamics. Specifically, the fluid modeling may produce (i) inaccurate system equilibrium, and (ii) inefficient design guidelines for large networks. Furthermore, optimal policies or algorithms derived from the fluid modeling framework may not be truly optimal and could result in poor performance. However, there have been virtually no results to address these limitations associated with the fluid-based approach, and this confines a network designer's choice to a very small subset of what can actually be chosen.<br\/> With these concerns in mind, this project will achieve the following goals: (1) To understand the fundamental limitations of the fluid-based approach and of the deterministic optimization for large networks. Although a deterministic representation is convenient and often becomes exact for some cases via probabilistic limit theory, it may produce sub-optimal or sometimes poor design guidelines if the network is not scaled in the way assumed by the mean-field approach. (2) To develop a stochastic framework for large networks in which we can compute true performance metrics defined on the stochastic description of the system, while at the same time exploiting the simplicity caused by the interaction among many users. Through our stochastic framework for large networks, we seek to obtain new, efficient design guidelines and algorithms for a number of important networking problems including congestion control, network optimization, and peer-to-peer networks, which would be impossible to obtain under the traditional fluid-based approach.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: The research outcomes and findings from this project will impact many important networking problems such as congestion control, and efficient usage of peer-to-peer networks, optimization of wireless networks, and cross-layer approaches to network design. Further, research progress on the proposed problems also has the potential to impact other science and engineering disciplines such as complex theory, statistical physics, and theoretical ecology, in which fluid modeling has played a key role. Based on a thorough investigation from multidisciplinary perspectives, the proposed research will promise a huge return upon its successful completion. The proposed research will foster multidisciplinary collaborations among students to the benefit of their own research, facilitate autonomous gatherings for interchanging ideas and better communication, and will motivate graduate\/undergraduate students with diverse backgrounds participating in this project.

However, the infrastructure of such networks is vulnerable to many types of network dynamics such as node mobility, potential attacks, and misbehavior. This research aims to develop models and algorithms for a deeper understanding of multihop networks when multiple failures are present. Specifically, this project includes three thrusts under the theme of resilience-to-failure: (1) the design, modeling, and analysis of the impact of multiple failures based on the Semi-Markov Process; (2) the design, evaluation, and implementation of a new mechanism in order to minimize the impact of neighboring node failures; (3) the study of distributed optimization algorithms for hierarchy and cluster formation. The expected results, such as models of node behavior and failures, along with techniques for topology discovery and topology optimization, promise significant scientific impact by presenting a theoretical framework for the design and implementation of network algorithms. The societal impact of this research lies in the wide deployment of portable devices for which communication failures may affect human welfare. Resilience-to-failure, as one of the areas that integrate multi-disciplinary characteristics, is used to initiate innovative curriculum and to advance the integration of research and education. In addition to traditional publications, informative and instructional materials will be developed and posted on the web in a timely manner for fast dissemination of results and education in the developed techniques.","title":"CAREER: A Unified Study of Resilience-to-Failure in Multihop Wireless Networks","awardID":"0546289","effectiveDate":"2006-03-01","expirationDate":"2013-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["534041"],"PO":["557315"]},"115749":{"abstract":"This proposal requests funds to support an international workshop to explore complex, image rich digital collections and to identify viable alternative approaches to building, managing and providing access to distributed repositories in light of continuing dramatic increases in computational resources available to researchers and organizations.

In fact, the proliferation of supercomputers and clusters has been driving the need for more efficient desktop processing, to assist high-end computing in tool validation, data analysis, and visualization. However, with the rapidly growing data volume and task complexity, it is increasingly hard for individual workstations to meet the demands of interactive scientific data processing. The increasing cost of such interactive processing is hindering the productivity of end-to-end scientific computing workflows. The project will develop a novel desktop parallel computing framework to speed up scientific data processing tasks routinely executed on desktop machines. It will allow users to preserve the interactiveness and convenience of desktop processing, without explicit resource request or waiting for batch execution, while their computation is seamlessly accelerated by aggregating idle computing and storage resources in local-area networks. This framework comprises several closely coupled innovative techniques to be developed in this research: data processing semantics specification based on relational algebra, on top of which we design application interfaces for automatic and flexible program parallelization; integrated computing resource aggregation and storage resource aggregation, on top of which we develop<br\/>parallel I\/O for desktop parallel computing; asymmetric task scheduling that exploits the central role of the client workstation, for guaranteed interactive execution, better fault tolerance, and diverse self-configuration opportunities; and quantitative and explicit performance impact control based on impact benchmarking and real-time workload monitoring that protects the performance of resource donors native workloads, in the presence of aggressive and persistent resource stealing. The proposed framework possesses three key properties that distinguish itself significantly from existing parallel execution platforms: interactiveness (immediate execution regardless of the availability of external resources), transparency (hiding the availability of and fluctuation in external resources from both application developers and users), and customized performance impact control (throttling a parallel jobs resource consumption according to the resource usage measured from the native workload of individual resource owners). Our research takes the initial steps towards a new parallel computing paradigm suitable for heterogeneous and opportunistic environments. With this new paradigm, users do not have to specify the amount of resources needed, nor do they have to wait for such resources to become available.","title":"CAREER: Transparent, Interactive Desktop Parallel Computing for Scientific Data Processing","awardID":"0546301","effectiveDate":"2006-03-01","expirationDate":"2012-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["549981"],"PO":["535244"]},"112516":{"abstract":"Abstract<br\/><br\/>Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research Infrastructure<br\/>Title: CRI: Collaborative Research: Reconfigurable Computing Cluster <br\/><br\/>Lead Proposal: CNS 0551688 <br\/>PI: Sass, Ronald<br\/>Institution: University of Kansas Center for Research Inc<br\/><br\/>Collaborative Proposal: CNS 0551678<br\/>PI: Chatha, Karamvir<br\/>Institution : Arizona State University<br\/><br\/>Researchers at the University of Kansas, Arizona State University and Clemson University will acquire a 64-node experimental Reconfigurable Computing Cluster to support on-going research projects investigating High-Performance Computing.

These embedded processors are designed for increasingly complex tasks and have to deliver ever-higher levels of performance. To fulfill these demands, designers rely on steady miniaturization and large-scale integration. However, this results in rising power densities and failure rates. Power dissipated on a chip is converted to heat. When the heat output from the processor combines with the high temperatures frequently found in embedded system environments, expensive processes can be required to keep the system cool enough to run.

A particularly effective technique in reducing the power consumption of all kinds of displays is the dynamic backlight scaling technique, where the intensity of the backlight lamp and the LCD transmittance function are changed concurrently and in proportion so that the same visual perception is created in the human eyes at much lower levels of power consumption. This research therefore aims to develop spatiotemporal and\/or color-aware backlight scaling techniques for pixel transformation of the displayed still images or video streams so as to maximize the energy saving in a target platform. The new techniques , which take advantage of the human visual system characteristics to minimize distortion between the original and backlight-scaled images\/videos, will be implemented and demonstrated on the Apollo Testbed II hardware platform. The broader impact of the research is to significantly reduce the power consumption of typical handheld devices, increasing their discharge-cycle lifetime, thereby, enabling more widespread and convenient use of such devices. The backlight dimming technology can also be applied in AC-powered systems where the key concern is the energy cost to the individual user as well as the society at large. This technology has the potential to reduce the typical energy bill of a desktop computer by 30% or so (when the system is being used). This research, if successful, will expedite introduction of advanced display technologies (such as LED-based backlighting for LCDs, or organic LED-based displays) since it will reduce their power cost without sacrificing quality.","title":"Hardware\/Software Support and Algorithms for Dynamic Backlight Scaling in TFT LCDs","awardID":"0541469","effectiveDate":"2006-03-01","expirationDate":"2010-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4710","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["518663"],"PO":["562984"]},"110428":{"abstract":"Auburn University proposes African-American Researchers in Computing Sciences (AARCS), a program that aims to broaden the participation of African-Americans at the levels of tenure track faculty and research scientist in the computing sciences.

As a consequence of these studies, she has observed several problems arising from current designs: users do not switch modes effectively; users are unable to intervene after a long period of autonomy; users have a lack of situation awareness; information is presented ineffectively; and bystanders are confused when the robot acts in an unexpected fashion. Based upon these issues, the PI has identified four challenge areas for interacting with autonomous systems: blending user and robot inputs to create sliding scale autonomy; automatically changing autonomy levels; summarizing robot state and past actions; and interacting with bystanders. During the first three year of this project, the PI will design systems and conduct experiments in and effort to find answers to these challenge areas. She will test her theories in two robot applications: urban search and rescue, which requires the operator to be remotely located; and robotic wheelchairs, where the operator is sitting on the robot and bystanders can be affected by the operation of the system. In the final two years of the project, the PI will validate her theories in a third application: a robot assistant for the elderly or disabled. Throughout the grant period, the research will be integrated into courses (undergraduate as well as graduate), as well as outreach activities in middle and high schools. The PI will also develop a new course, Interacting with Autonomous Systems, which will address both human-computer interaction (HCI) and human-robot interaction (HRI). The intellectual merits of this project includes: formulation and testing of theories for determining how to appropriately set and switch autonomy levels for robotic systems; creation of methods for blending autonomy levels to create new autonomy levels; development of an improved understanding of interaction with robotic systems; and validation of all hypotheses through the development of a new robotic system.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: All of the robot application areas to be explored in this research have the potential to impact society.

In CTM, each processor core is divided into regions with integrated monitoring and test support, as well as the ability to push parameters (such as supply voltage) below worst case recommended limits. Guard bands are determined dynamically at runtime through a combination of localized stress testing and redundant safe operation on an adjacent unit with the same functionality. These guard bands should be almost always lower than can be achieved statically at design time and therefore can yield additional performance or power savings. Frequent periodic reassessment of guard bands permits the system to tolerate large, slow changes in environment (such as an increase in neutron flux with higher elevation) without having to resort to constant redundancy and its corresponding performance and power costs.

On the other hand, interconnect wires become narrower, and hence more resistive and slower in transmitting signals. Since the advent of 250nm technology at 1997, the signal transmission delay caused by interconnect wires has dominated the total delay. With the feature size down to 65nm in advanced ICs, interconnect delay is clearly one of the most important concerns in today's IC design.<br\/><br\/>For a given technology, the delay of an interconnect is mainly determined by its length. In other words, the delay of an interconnect wire can be reduced by placing the two connected transistors closer to each other on<br\/>the chip. Hence, because of the increasing dominance of interconnect delay in nanometer regime, placement of transistor devices on a chip has become a critical step in the IC design flow. However, in existing placement approaches, the interconnect characteristics are approximated by very inaccurate models. After placement of devices, actual implementation of interconnects is carried out by performing routing (which means the actual layout of the interconnect wires on the chip) and interconnect optimization (which typcially includes widening of wires, changing of driver sizes, and insertion of buffers). Those inaccurate models do not capture these actual implementation details. As a result, the interconnect and device resources required by the routing and interconnect optimization steps are not adequately estimated and reserved during placement. Thus, the placed circuit may not be routable and the interconnects may not be successfully optimized. In that case, the circuit must be placed, routed and optimized repeatedly until routing can be completed and the performance after interconnect optimization is satisfactory. Such an iterative process may take a long time to converge or may not even converge at all. Even if a routable circuit is finally obtained, the quality of the<br\/>placement solution is inevitably poor because placement is based on rudimentary interconnect information which is very different from that after routing and interconnect optimization. Therefore, there is a<br\/>critical need for a novel approach to accurately consider the impact of interconnects during placement.<br\/>The objective of this proposal is to design an efficient approach to incorporate routing and interconnect optimization into placement. Efficient algorithms will be developed to handle the enormous complexity,<br\/>complicated metrics and restrictive constraints in modern and future industrial designs. Successful development of the proposed approach is essential for future large-scale designs in the nanometer regime to<br\/>achieve superior performance and short time-to-market previously not possible.","title":"Improved Placement Approach by Incorporating Global Routing and Interconnect Optimization","awardID":"0540998","effectiveDate":"2006-03-15","expirationDate":"2010-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4710","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["518602"],"PO":["562984"]},"111507":{"abstract":"CAREER: Understanding, Estimating, and Reducing Processor Design Complexity <br\/>The goal of this CAREER project is to understand, estimate, and reduce processor design complexity.

The two key innovations of this project are: (1) it looks at how these four modules can be integrated to work in combination, instead of making in isolation decisions that have a significant impact on the overall performance; and (2) this project formalizes QoS\/QoD metrics for DSMSs<br\/>and develops algorithms designed to optimize these metrics. In addition, the project plans include the analytical and experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms and also the implementation and evaluation of a prototype system. This project provides opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students to participate in the development of cutting edge technology.

At the top of the list was lung cancer, a disease that is eminently preventable. Addressing public health threats like cancer are acute, system-wide challenges that would benefit from network-centric approaches. For example, when the tobacco research community realized it had taken over a decade to discover that they had already collected substantial empirical evidence, distributed across its network of tobacco researchers, indicating that 'light' (low-tar\/low-nicotine brands) cigarettes reduced neither exposure to nor risk of cancer, researchers began to understand the importance of effectively sharing resources and information across the entire community. In response, government agencies involved in public health have made a substantial foundational investment in developing a digital government cyberinfrastructure--Tobacco Systems integration Grid (TobacSIG)--to enable collaboration within the Tobacco Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Evaluation Network (TSEEN). While such an underlying cyberinfrastructure is a prerequisite, delays in discoveries (such as the carcinogenic effects of 'light' cigarette mentioned above) have prompted the TSEEN community to underscore the need for social network referral tools as a crucial component of any effort to enhance the efficacy of their collaboration system.<br\/><br\/>This project will develop, deploy and assess social networking tools to enhance collaboration among members of TSEEN using the TobacSIG cyberinfrastructure. The proposed project brings together researchers in information science, social science, and public health who have established strong collaborations with government partners on the development of networks to support transdisciplinary research in public health. The researchers have assisted the government partners in formulating the challenges and envisioning solutions; hence the research team is will positioned to leverage the substantial financial and human resources being invested by NIH National Cancer Institute and its partner government agencies in the TobacSIG cyberinfrastructure.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed project is a pioneering effort at incorporating social network referral tools as an integral part of collaborative systems within the context of digital government. First, the proposed project will extend theoretical understanding of the emergence of collaboration network structures involving multidimensional networks, where nodes may be individuals, documents, data sets, services (such as visual-analytic tools), or keywords\/concepts. Second, it will pioneer theory development and testing about the influence of network referral systems on collaboration outcomes. Specifically, the proposed project will assess the extent to which collaboration outcomes are influenced by (i) different theoretically-derived structures of network referrals, (ii) different incentive structures provided to users of the network referral system, (iii) different types of network data used to generate referrals, and (iv) different information visualizations used to represent network referrals. Third, the research will extend the exponential random graph modeling techniques that have been largely used to estimate structural dependencies in relatively small (typically no larger than 500) one-dimensional networks. The proposed project will extend these techniques to multidimensional networks containing over 10,000 nodes.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: As cyberinfrastructure is deployed to support collaboration among large communities in government and elsewhere, it is increasingly obvious that social network tools have immense potential. In this project the researchers will seek to respond to the refrain 'if only the Tobacco Surveillance Epidemiology Evaluation Network knew what it knew.' Generalizing the relevance of this same refrain to a wide spectrum of other contexts is suggestive of the broader impacts of the proposed research. The findings and deliverables of the proposed research will be immediately generalizable to the design and deployment of social network referral tools to support collaboration among other digital government efforts within public health and beyond. Further, the government and non-government partners in this project are exceptionally well-equipped to incorporate into their regularly scheduled education, training, and outreach workshops the skill sets of collaborative fluency afforded by the judicious use of network referral systems. Finally, by definition, social network referral systems have the potential to increase the likelihood of drawing in more diverse constituents within the public health community (in terms of gender, ethnicity, age, seniority, disciplinary perspectives) than heretofore possible.

The project will address four fundamental challenges common to periodic and aperiodic dynamic movements. First, analytical modeling and high fidelity dynamic simulation will be combined to develop quantitative metrics of dynamic stability based upon the level of intelligence required for recovery from disturbance. Second, evolutionary robotics strategies will be employed to efficiently search the large, discontinuous, and irregular solution space in order to generate truly dynamic movements. Third, a high-speed, drift-resistant sensing approach will be developed that is robust to large impacts with the environment by dividing the localization and attitude sensing problem into stance and flight segments. Fourth, an efficient, hybrid actuation approach will be developed in which electric motors actuate the hip degrees of freedom directly and, together with a novel air-spring system, provide the axial thrust.

The work focuses on least-cost structure problems where the goal is to find a least-cost structure derivable under a set of compositional rules. This least-cost structure might be a parse tree, a match of a deformable model to an image, or an assignment of values to variables in a Markov random field. The algorithms investigated are based on a generalization of A* search and abstractions to arbitrary least-cost structure problems. Finding the least-cost abstract structure is typically vastly more efficient than finding the least-cost concrete structure. Furthermore, the least-cost abstract structure provides heuristic guidance, in the sense of A* search, in solving the concrete optimization problem. Generalized A* uses abstract structures spanning all levels of processing of a perceptual systems in guiding the search for more concrete structures in a hierarchy of abstraction spaces.

Significantly, the number of women and minority students who consider the possibility of majoring in computing has fallen even more dramatically, further restricting the pool of available talent. Mobilizing concerned leaders to form alliances that can identify and implement innovative strategies to attract and retain a broad range of students in computing disciplines could have enormous impact not only in terms of strengthening the nation's economy but also in preserving equality of opportunity.","title":"Proposal for Community-Building Meetings for the National Science Foundation's Broadening Participation in Computing Initiative","awardID":"0622450","effectiveDate":"2006-03-01","expirationDate":"2008-10-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}}],"PIcoPI":["320601"],"PO":["561855"]},"109566":{"abstract":"The investigators will study how to enable biped robots to execute truly dynamic movements such as running, jumping, turning, starting rapidly, and stopping suddenly. For a biped to react flexibly and intelligently to changing surroundings, it must be endowed with a greater set of functional behaviors than those that are currently realized. The project will address four fundamental challenges common to periodic and aperiodic dynamic movements. First, analytical modeling and high fidelity dynamic simulation will be combined to develop quantitative metrics of dynamic stability based upon the level of intelligence required for recovery from disturbance. Second, evolutionary robotics strategies will be employed to efficiently search the large, discontinuous, and irregular solution space in order to generate truly dynamic movements. Third, a high-speed, drift-resistant sensing approach will be developed that is robust to large impacts with the environment by dividing the localization and attitude sensing problem into stance and flight segments. Fourth, an efficient, hybrid actuation approach will be developed in which electric motors actuate the hip degrees of freedom directly and, together with a novel air-spring system, provide the axial thrust. Finally, the work addressing these four challenges will be experimentally validated by constructing a three-dimensional biped capable of robustly executing fundamental dynamic movements. The results of this project will broadly impact the field of legged robotics since the core issues of dynamic stability, complex motion generation, high-speed sensing, and efficient actuation are not unique to a bipedal structure.","title":"Collaborative Research: Dynamic Movement in Bipedal Locomotion","awardID":"0535226","effectiveDate":"2006-03-01","expirationDate":"2009-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["378572"],"PO":["403839"]},"112481":{"abstract":"This collaborative project, developing a broad suite of data mining benchmarks, defines benchmark data sets and efficient algorithms for important data mining kernels establishing a comprehensive benchmark suite for data mining applications.

Similar problems exist in the field of system safety, but recently a new accident model has been devised that uses a systems-theoretic approach to understand accident causation. Systems theory allows complex relationships between events and the system as a whole to be taken into account, so this new model permits an accident to be considered not simply as arising from a chain of individual component failures, but from the interactions among system components, including those that have not failed.<br\/><br\/>This exploratory research will examine how this new approach to safety can be applied to Internet security, using worms as a first example. The long-term goal is to create a general model of trustworthiness that can incorporate both safety and security, along with system modeling tools and analysis methods that can be used to create more trustworthy socio-technical systems.

A fair solution opens tremendous application possibilities. The proposed work will use existing tools from the speech and object recognition community --- in particular, finite state automata or FSA's --- to obtain an understanding of activities that depend on detailed information about the body.<br\/><br\/>The particular focus is everyday activity. In this case, a fixed vocabulary either doesn't exist, or isn't appropriate. For example, one does not know words for behaviors that appear familiar. One way to deal with this is to work with a notation (for example, laban notation); but such notations typically work in terms that are difficult to map to visual observables (for example, the weight of a motion). The alternatives are either to develop a vocabulary, or to develop expressive tools for authoring models.<br\/><br\/>This project will explore the third approach of building tools for authoring models of behavior quickly and expressively using finite-state methods. Research will explore a class of models that are easy to author from existing, or easily available, data. The interpretation of what someone is doing is affected by the objects<br\/>nearby --- a person standing near a bus stop is doing something different from a person standing near an office door. The models studied make it practical to investigate this phenomenon of object context, using recent advances from the object recognition literature.<br\/><br\/>Evaluating models for everyday behaviors is hard, because there is no prospect of obtaining a large collection of marked up video (among other things, there isn't a vocabulary in which to mark it up). This project will use proxies --- statistics that are hard to measure from video without accurate inferences of behavior, but easy to measure in other ways --- to evaluate behavior representations. These will make it possible to tell whether, for example, a model of buying a beverage represents the concept accurately.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual merits: This project will produce very large finite state models of behavior using the same hierarchical authoring methods used in speech. There will be a particular emphasis on behaviors which require one to understand the kinematic configuration of the body, a topic that has been very difficult to study to date, with an intention of identifying basic building blocks of a vocabulary of everyday behavior. The results should include datasets of public behavior that can be disseminated, without encountering privacy concerns. New insights into the structure of human motion and behavior should emerge from (a) observations of people in public; (b) the process of authoring models; and (c) methods for identifying and modelling compositional structure in motion.<br\/><br\/>Broader impact: This project should make substantial progress on one of the key open and applicable problems in computer vision. Methods that can search video for particular behaviors and compute statistics of behaviors have a wide range of applications, including human-computer interfaces built around computers that can watch the body; an improved understanding of what people do in public which will result in better architectural planning; more efficient management of surveillance data, allowing searches for dangerous behaviors while preserving privacy. Education and access: This project will contribute to the graduate training of several students, and work described will contribute to a planned text on computing with human motion.<br\/><br\/>URL: http:\/\/luthuli.cs.uiuc.edu\/~daf\/action.html","title":"Interpreting Human Behaviour in Video using FSA's and Object Context","awardID":"0534837","effectiveDate":"2006-03-01","expirationDate":"2010-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7339","name":"COMPUTER VISION"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["457204"],"PO":["564316"]},"110590":{"abstract":"0541241<br\/>PI: John G.

The proposed architecture combines previous spike-based sensory processing ideas developed by the PIs with a compelling model of brain computation called the Liquid State Machine (LSM). This model provides a conceptual framework for working with biologically realistic pulsed neuron models (integrate-and-fire neurons) as the basic computational element within a recurrent nonlinear architecture.

The PIs will develop a sampling theory for converting continuous variable inputs into aperiodic spike trains (and likewise transform spikes trains back to continuous amplitude signals).<br\/>2. Although interesting, the architecture of the LSM can be largely improved once the characteristics of the computation are better understood. In particular, while the interconnect of the liquid is arbitrary and fixed, the PIs plan to develop a theory of adaptation for such spike based representations.<br\/>3. The PIs will map the spike-based architecture to todays silicon electronics. This hybrid analog\/digital architecture is fundamentally different from both conventional digital architectures and past analog computing devices. However, the proposed architecture will be of only scientific interest if it cannot be built with competitive performance measures in terms of computational capability, power consumption, noise immunity and dynamic range. Therefore, in order to design the architecture in silicon, the PIs will identify key computational principles, design signal transformations, and fabricate the resulting building blocks with huge numbers of sufficiently small components in CMOS technology. <br\/>Finally, in order to ground the theoretical research and design in engineering practice, the PIs propose to develop a prototype system for chemical sensing using an off-the-shelf electronic nose (or e-nose) as the front end. This application was chosen due to its importance in homeland security, and also because it provides a natural input to the proposed spike-based architecture.","title":"A Spike-based Computer Architecture for Sensory Processing","awardID":"0541241","effectiveDate":"2006-03-15","expirationDate":"2010-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0405","name":"Division of OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE","abbr":"SES"},"pgm":{"id":"7704","name":"Science of Learning Activities"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["438490","492015"],"PO":["562984"]},"111492":{"abstract":"Title: CAREER: Towards a Self-Taught Vision System<br\/>PI: Erik Learned-Miller<br\/><br\/>Abstract<br\/><br\/>Using modern learning techniques, it is now possible to teach computers visual concepts through example-based learning. But this process is time consuming and arduous. Often large data sets must be manually collected. Machines typically do not take advantage of previously learned knowledge when performing new tasks. And when confronted with a new situation, systems fail catastrophically. The goal of this research is to make it dramatically easier to teach vision systems new skills, and to design machines that can learn tasks faster by leveraging previously learned knowledge. In short, the aim is to develop computer vision systems that are largely self-taught. More specifically, this research will focus on problems such as learning from a small number of examples; using previously learned knowledge to improve performance on novel tasks; learning properties of one object that can be used to make inferences about other objects; acquiring and organizing information autonomously; and leveraging interdisciplinary techniques to help relieve people from the burden of ``training'' computers.<br\/><br\/>These capabilities are taken for granted in human beings, but represent serious shortcomings in today's computer systems. A central tenet of this work is that it is impractical to train vision systems one problem at a time, acquiring large training sets and developing training paradigms for each task to be learned. There are many scenarios in which training data are severely limited (there are limited photos of Abraham Lincoln). And ideally, computer systems should be adaptive, and not have to be prepared for each new task, especially when these new tasks are similar to previous ones. Some specific areas of investigation include learning to recognize any particular car or face from a single example, simply by watching other cars or faces as they move about; developing software for robots to continously explore the visual world and the interactions between vision and the other senses; and learning to recognize typewritten text in a font never seen before, without ANY training examples of that font. The common thread in these efforts is that they relieve the burden on the teacher of the computer. The final goal is to develop computers that can be taught simply and rapidly, and that can explore on their own.<br\/><br\/>Educational initiatives will be developed in two areas.

The algorithms investigated are based on a generalization of A* search and abstractions to arbitrary least-cost structure problems. Finding the least-cost abstract structure is typically vastly more efficient than finding the least-cost concrete structure. Furthermore, the least-cost abstract structure provides heuristic guidance, in the sense of A* search, in solving the concrete optimization problem. Generalized A* uses abstract structures spanning all levels of processing of a perceptual systems in guiding the search for more concrete structures in a hierarchy of abstraction spaces.

While there has been an abundance of previous work on resource management, there has been a dearth of research to address the complex problem of resource interdependencies for mobile systems. For example, most modern mobile devices employ multiple techniques to reduce their energy requirements, however, these techniques focus on individual resources and are unaware of the effects their deployment may have on other resources and application performance. Further, in distributed systems, devices typically are selfish in the sense that they manage their own resources without considering the consequences for resources and applications on remote devices. This NSF CAREER research project is developing both, an experimental framework for investigating these interdependencies and design issues, and new service concepts to provide resource management solutions that enable the efficient integration of multiple constraints, resources, and devices. The new approach, dubbed judicious resource management, moves away from traditional, isolated resource management solutions and focuses on the prevention of unanticipated side effects of interdependent resource adaptations. The broader impacts of this project include an experimental setting that should serve as catalyst for future research on distributed resource management, paving the way for new classes of protocols, management techniques, and approaches to integrate them. This work closely integrates research and education activities, using a single experimental test bed for research, education, and outreach efforts.","title":"CAREER: Judicious Resource Management in Wireless Systems","awardID":"0545899","effectiveDate":"2006-03-01","expirationDate":"2012-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["474129"],"PO":["561889"]},"112484":{"abstract":"This collaborative project, developing tools that support the dynamic (as it runs) modification of software and exploring the use of these tools, addresses many critical challenges facing software developers.

Such large ASICs will be commonplace only if the EDA tools can keep up with the<br\/>growing size and complexity of designs. Though this problem is widely recognized, most commercial<br\/>research and development efforts have focused on semiconductor process related issues and low-level design tools as opposed to high-level design tools. The proposed research will develop a high-level design methodology and accompanying tools to enable complex digital systems to be translated into high quality physical implementations with reduced design effort. The central themes of any such methodology must be correctness by construction and rapid and transparent performance tuning. The researchers will build upon the work at MIT and elsewhere on synthesis from high-level hardware descriptions expressed as guarded atomic actions. This prior work forms the basis of the Bluespec hardware description language which has been developed by Bluespec Inc. as an extension to SystemVerilog for hardware modeling, synthesis, and verification. The researchers will use Bluespec tools as infrastructure for developing new design methodologies, synthesis algorithms, and tools. The research will focus in two specific areas.<br\/>Performance specifications and associated synthesis algorithms: Currently the Bluespec<br\/>compiler deduces a good schedule that satisfies the scheduling constraints detected among<br\/>the guarded atomic actions. Although the automatically generated control logic enables a<br\/>functionally correct by construction methodology, achieving adequate performance can sometimes<br\/>be challenging. This project will develop methods to allow designers to directly specify<br\/>the concurrency properties of rules and module interfaces and have the compiler generate an<br\/>implementation that preserves the desired concurrency without violating correctness. Unit Transaction Level (UTL) discipline: Given a design with a deeply nested module hierarchy, the Bluespec compiler can generate arbitrarily complex control structures and long wires. The project will develop the Unit Transaction Level (UTL) discipline to be imposed on top of guarded atomic actions so that very large designs can be implemented effciently in hardware. The UTL discipline relies on latency-insensitive interfaces to allow additional registers to be inserted post-synthesis to aid in timing closure and power reduction. The UTL discipline enables designers to more clearly see how high-level design decisions will impact various physical design issues.","title":"Generating High-Quality Complex Digital Systems from High-Level Specifications","awardID":"0541164","effectiveDate":"2006-03-15","expirationDate":"2010-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["370891",292937],"PO":["562984"]},"110593":{"abstract":"\\Out-of-Core Simplification and Multiresolution Visualization of Large Volume Data Exploring Topological Features<br\/><br\/>Yi-Jen Chiang, Polytechnic University of New York <br\/><br\/><br\/>In recent years, new challenges for scientific visualization emerged as the size of large-scale data grew exponentially. The sheer size of data often makes the task of interactive exploration impossible, and it is no longer feasible for the scientists to come up with the desired visualization parameters by a brute-force try-and-error process on the raw data; additional feature-analysis information is needed to guide them through the data exploration process. There are two important and promising research directions towards solving large-scale visualization problems: multiresolution techniques and out-of-core approaches. Also, one of the most important features of a scalar-field dataset is the topology of all isosurfaces embedded in the volume data, which plays a central role in understanding the behavior of the scalar field.<br\/><br\/>This research involves the development of out-of-core simplification algorithms that smoothly simplify the geometry of the volume mesh as well as the topology of the embedded isosurfaces to build a multiresolution volume hierarchy, and out-of-core level-of-detail (LOD) visualization algorithms, including isosurface extraction and direct volume rendering, that use the multiresolution volume hierarchy as a unified infrastructure to support LOD visualization satisfying both the topology and geometry error bounds specified. The techniques being developed also provide a road map of the topological features of all isosurfaces in order to guide the user through the data exploration process. The investigators work on both steady-state (i.e., single time step) and time-varying data and typically consider the class of irregular-grid volume datasets represented as tetrahedral meshes. The project is exploring the rich interplay between theory and practice by applying approaches from Morse theory and computational topology to the design of visualization algorithms. The aim is the development of a collection of novel, out-of-core visualization algorithms that explore topological features, together with a unified, proof-of-the-concept visualization system equipped with a topology-analysis user interface that enables scientists to perform effective feature extraction and efficient visualization on their desktop PCs for much larger datasets than can fit in the computers main memory.

Similarly, logical bugs can make concurrent systems unreliable, or even fail. In today's concurrent system designs, finding and fixing logical bugs early is of the highest priority because it is very costly when bugs are found late in the design stage. Bugs left undetected in systems can cause huge losses to the economy and human society. The correct operation of systems must be guaranteed at any cost for safety critical applications that can be found in nuclear power plants and airplane flight control systems. However, making sure complex systems work correctly is very difficult because both functional complexity and density of systems are growing exponentially, imposing unprecedented challenges on verification. Among various verification technologies, model checking, a verification approach based on formal methods, has unique advantages because it is fully automated and can produce counter-examples for errors in systems to help debugging. Because of very high verification coverage, it can find bugs hidden very deeply. However, capabilities and robustness of model checking cannot keep up with the exponential growth of concurrent system complexity. It imposes a great burden on the model checking users to have deep understanding of the underlying verification algorithms and heuristics for effective use of the tools, thus limiting the widespread acceptance of model checking.<br\/><br\/>This research addresses the challenges to and limitations of real-time concurrent system verification. In this research, the investigator studies various approaches to handle the complexity issue inherent in model checking, and develops methods and tools that enable model checking to be applicable to large real-time concurrent systems. These methods and tools are completely transparent to users of model checking so that they can be used in the same way as simulation. The intellectual merit of this research lies in a set of novel methods and algorithms to enhance the capacity and robustness of model checking for real-time concurrent system verification based on composition, hierarchy, and abstraction. Furthermore, design and verification are viewed as being interdependent, and a design-for-verification method with a new framework of high abstraction level modeling and refinement is developed. Successful completion of this research project will have broader impact on significant reduction in verification cost in the current system design process with improved capability of model checking, thus lowering the overall design cost of the final products. In addition, enabling model checking to be more accessible leads to dramatic improvements on product quality and system security, and reduces the losses due to the holes in products and systems. The integrated education plan of this research develops a new learning framework focusing on increasing students' learning and thinking skills, and integrating research with education. In addition, K-12 and underrepresented students will be involved in the proposed research through NSF REU and RET programs.","title":"CAREER: Methodologies and Tools for Large Real-Time Concurrent System Verification","awardID":"0546492","effectiveDate":"2006-03-15","expirationDate":"2012-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7945","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYST"}}],"PIcoPI":["420575"],"PO":["562984"]},"112463":{"abstract":"Project Proposed:<br\/><br\/>This project, seeking to enhance the programming tools available in PLT scheme, aims at <br\/>Improving its performance, <br\/>Developing a dynamic foreign library interface, <br\/>Developing a web programming environment, and <br\/>Supporting language embeddings into its environment. <br\/><br\/>The PLT suite of software tools consists of an interpreter and an interactive program development environment for the Scheme programming language, with special support for component programming, graphics, web programming, and numerous extension libraries.
