{"86608":{"abstract":"Increasing concern over the role of atmospheric particles (aerosols) on global climate change, human health and welfare and the Earth's ecosystem has created a great need to better understand the composition, origin, and influence of atmospheric pollutants. In order to develop control strategies that can mitigate the onset of climate change, as well as the degradation of the environment and our quality of life, there is a great need to better understand the sources, dynamics, and compositions of atmospheric aerosols. Recent advances in aerosol science have led to the development of a new generation of real-time instruments, which provide continuous or semi-continuous streams of data about certain aerosol properties. However, these instruments have added a significant level of complexity to atmospheric aerosol data, and dramatically increased the amounts of data to be collected, managed, and analyzed. <br\/><br\/>This project aims to mine atmospheric aerosol data sets, and in the process, to develop novel mining environments that can be applied in other domains as well. Time-series analysis, clustering, and decision trees are well-known techniques for which robust software is available, and will be used to analyze atmospheric aerosol datasets. In addition, new approaches will be explored as appropriate, including a framework called subset mining that is especially suited for finding correlations between (parts of) different datasets, such as mass spectrometry and environmental monitoring data. An important objective is to develop a framework to create multi-step analyses using one or more mining techniques, and to focus the patterns generated by these techniques by incorporating domain knowledge into the analysis. The goal is to reduce the time required for complex analyses by leveraging user input to automatically explore a large space of alternative models, and to take advantage of optimizations made possible by exploring several models in parallel. A related objective is to enable research groups to share their results, all the way down to the datasets and how they were processed to arrive at the results, in an analysis environment with continually evolving datasets and complex analysis chains. <br\/><br\/>This project will train graduate and undergraduate students at UW-Madison and Carleton College in two disciplines, Computer Science and Atmospheric Chemistry. In addition to the educational impact, the research results and tools will be widely disseminated through publications and the Web (www.cs.wisc.edu\/~raghu\/admitr), and are expected to significantly advance the state of the art in two directions: (1) Scientific and regulatory efforts to understand and mitigate the impacts of air pollution and environmental contaminants, (2) Foundations, algorithms, and technology for data mining.","title":"ITR: Collaborative Focused Mining of Atmospheric Aerosol Datasets: Integration of Mass Spectrometry and Environmental Monitoring","awardID":"0326328","effectiveDate":"2003-10-15","expirationDate":"2008-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["284906","522097","510715","510715","558243"],"PO":["563727"]},"86619":{"abstract":"The goal of this project is to develop a novel device the PIs call the Vocal Joystick (VJ), that will enable individuals with motor impairments to make use of vocal parameters to control objects on a computer screen (buttons, sliders, etc.) and ultimately also electro-mechanical instruments such as robotic arms and wireless home automation devices. Standard spoken language can be quite inefficient for such continuous control tasks, and is often recognized poorly by automatic speech recognizers. Existing assistive devices, such as sip and puff switches, have extremely low communication bandwidth and can therefore only be used for limited tasks. The Vocal Joystick, by contrast, will allow users to exploit a large and varied set of vocalizations whose selection will be optimized with respect to reliable automatic recognizability, communication bandwidth, learnability, and ease of use. This set may include regular speech sounds, such as vowels and consonants, but the primary focus will be on the variation of individual acoustic-phonetic parameters like pitch, loudness, vowel quality, and voice quality. The PIs will select the basic VJ sound set, and will develop high-accuracy and low-latency acoustic processing techniques for the members of the set. They will design customizable libraries and application programmer interfaces that facilitate the application of VJ technology to a variety of control tasks. And they will test the new technology on the target population group, i.e., users with motor impairments. <br\/><br\/>This research will significantly advance our understanding of human interface technology in general, and speech-based technology in particular. Eschewing the common view that speech as used in everyday human-human communication is also the best way to interact with computers or physical devices, the PIs claim exploiting the full range of possible vocalizations is not only a necessary extension to standard speech recognition but is, in certain contexts, superior to it. This view entails a wealth of open research issues, since non-speech vocalizations have traditionally been regarded as \"garbage'', an impediment rather than an aid to speech-based human-computer communication. Particularly challenging tasks are the design of novel signal processing and recognition algorithms that operate without relying on the contextual information found in natural speech, the development of vocal widgets (an extension to the standard concept of user interface widgets), and exploring human ability to use multiple continuous and discrete control signals simultaneously.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This project will have a significant impact in a variety of ways. The research is itself an outreach activity, in that its goal is to develop a new type of human-computer interface for users with motor impairments; the resulting technology will allow these users to lead more independent and productive lives. Individuals with motor impairments will be included in this project at all stages, not only as participants in usability tests but also as undergraduate research team members. School-age children will be included in the early stages of the VJ design. All software resulting from this project will be documented and distributed via the Internet, so that individuals can use it to configure their own VJ interfaces.","title":"ITR: The Vocal Joystick: Voice-based Assistive Technology for Individuals with Motor Impairments","awardID":"0326382","effectiveDate":"2003-10-01","expirationDate":"2009-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["387675","508528",226556,"562966","553580"],"PO":["565227"]},"81977":{"abstract":"In this research, we propose computer-aided design (CAD) techniques that consider manufacturability and reliability of very large scaled integrated circuits (VLSI),<br\/><br\/>First, we consider optical lithography which is the enabling technology for the fabrication of today's VLSI.

Unlike many scientific communities, weather observers and atmospheric scientists rely heavily on important visual cues in the atmosphere to determine the potential severity of many storms.<br\/>However, the current state-of-the-art in weather visualization from systems such as Vis5D, VisAD, or D3D, lack important visual information that is crucial for atmospheric scientists to fully understand the development and evolution of weather systems.<br\/>Recognizing the importance of these visual cues, this project will significantly enhance the visualization of weather data through the development of innovative software techniques that will provide more accurate and effective visual representations of weather data. Simple visualization practices, such as depth cueing, isosurface texturing, volume shading, shadows, and correct natural color effects (such as sunlight) are absent in current weather data visualization software. While advanced computer graphics applications (e.g., movie production) have effectively used these techniques for some time, they have yet to be applied in a robust way to weather data. In this project, we will not only fill this gap to create improved, visually accurate weather data visualization, but also increase the quantity and clarity of the information conveyed from the resulting visualizations. Using mature numerical weather prediction software, the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS), to generate numerically simulated severe weather events, new software techniques will be developed to enhance the visualization of this data and begin a new era in weather data visualization.<br\/>Beyond current capabilities of standard isosurfaces, scalar volume renderings, and two-dimensional images lies important rendering capabilities for weather visualization, such as shaded volumes, shadows, light-transport, and simulated natural cloud modeling. In this project, we will develop, enhance, and apply these techniques to atmospheric data in ways which have yet to be attempted.<br\/>The primary goal of our research is to produce visually accurate images of weather model data that will provide more accurate information than current methods and use the same cognitive model and analysis process as the forecasters already use, allowing them to increase their effectiveness. <br\/>We will additionally develop techniques to effectively incorporate non-visual data and allow the selective visualization of the visual \/ non-visual weather data to enable better understanding of the relationships between these variables and quantities. Our goal is to develop these improved techniques, while also allowing interactive exploration of the observed, measured, and model data.<br\/>Through the use of programmable graphics hardware with three-dimensional texture-mapping, we will implement techniques for interactive visually accurate weather visualization with low-albedo illumination, physics-based atmospheric scattering and attenuation, and volumetric shadowing. <br\/>We will also implement slower high-albedo illumination models at coarser resolutions to give approximate multiple scattering effects and utilize this scattering information in the illumination calculation per-pixel fragment through three-dimensional texture mapping hardware. We will use perceptually motivated mapping of non-visual weather quantities (e.g., temperature, dewpoint, wind, atmospheric pressure, vorticity) to glyphs, particles, and isosurfaces to provide more information in an easily understandable manner, extending on our previous work in rceptually-motivated glyph rendering, fast isosurface rendering, and volume illustration. Given the capabilities of current graphics hardware, we won't be able to produce truly visually accurate images and animations of time-varying atmospheric data for at least the first half of the project, although we expect to be able to produce good approximations at interactive rates. We also plan to incorporate simple key-frame recording tools into the visualization system for off-line generation of atmospheric visualizations.<br\/>The weather models produced contain multiple variables at each spatial location. By employing scientific-based combinations of these variables, it is possible to localize specific features contained in these models. We will extend our preliminary work in the development of multi-dimensional transfer function methods for multivariate data to effectively convey information from this complex model data.

On high-end devices, the system will deliver high-resolution images at real-time frame rates, while on lower-end devices (e.g., PDAs), the system will deliver smaller images at slower (albeit interactive) frame rates.

These networks - called mbuffered networks - have two distinguishing features. First, packet loss due to contention is treated as an erasure that can be corrected via coding techniques. Information is encoded into code words and each codeword is divided into fragments. The redundancy built into the codeword acts like a \"virtual buffer\" that mitigates contention and packet loss so that if several of the codeword fragments are erased as they pass through the network, there is still a high probability that the information within the codeword can be decoded correctly at the destination. Adaptive flow control can be implemented by adjusting the coding overhead (code rate) as well as the fragment generation rate. The second distinguishing feature is the robustness with respect to hardware and routing failures. In particular, different codeword fragments belonging to the same codeword can be sent using different routes within the network to increase resilience. Route diversity also provides unique security and authentication features.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit of the proposed project is the exploration of new architectural approaches that use little or no buffering in high-speed networks where buffers are becoming increasingly difficult to implement.

A typical P2P user session consists of a search phase where multiple searches may be conducted followed by a retrieval phase in which multiple files may be requested. Much research and development has gone into the design of differing systems for file search, with the aim of improving performance and robustness. In the proposed work, the researchers focus on the file retrieval phase, which has so far received less attention from the research community. We are motivated by three main observations: (i) A P2P system user's experience is the sum total of the performance of both the search as well as the retrieval functions; (ii) The network resources used during the retrieval phase can outweigh by far the resources consumed during the search phase. As such, new paradigms and improvements in the design of the retrieval phase can have far reaching implications on the performance of the Internet in general; (iii) A P2P system provides a significantly different context for content retrieval than the more traditional client-server model; they have larger scale content replication, the peers may possess severe resource constraints, and the peers are quite dynamic. Our proposed research encompasses three areas:<br\/><br\/>1. Peer selection strategies for improved performance of the retrieval phase. The resesearchers examine two aspects of this problem that are unique to the P2P environment and that have received little attention: (i) the fact that, due to the large-scale replication inherent in P2P systems, the search phase can only discover a subset of available replicas, and (ii) the constrained nature of serving peers which may require requests to block until serving capacity is available.<br\/>2. Content retrieval strategies involving multiple serving peers simultaneously. The large scale replication that may be present in P2P systems leads to the interesting possibility of performing file retrieval from multiple peers in parallel, both to improve performance and overcome peer dynamics and instability. This work considers the effect of wide-scale deployment of parallel downloading on performance as well as fairness among network users. In addition, our work revisits the selection problem in this context.<br\/>3. A holistic approach to the operation of P2P systems. The objective is to improve overall P2P user search and retrieval experience. We introduce a new dimension, the quality of a search, by which one should judge the performance of the outcome of a search phase and its effect on the performance during the retrieval phase. The researchers study existing search techniques with this new perspective and also consider two search paradigms inspired by prior work on distributed match-making algorithms and broadcast-stream scheduling.<br\/><br\/>The research output will consist of theoretical as well as practical studies of the areas described above. THe researchers will use a variety of techniques to evaluate our ideas (including mathematical and theoretical analysis, simulation, emulation, and experimentation). This work will be among the first to study the retrieval phase in P2P systems in depth. Because network resource usage is primarily influenced by the retrieval phase requirements, this work will also provide the basis of an understanding of the effect of P2P systems on Internet resources and further guide provisioning efforts to meet the demands of P2P systems. We are also committed to activities that will promote the broader impact of the proposed work including: (i) development of modules based on our research for graduate and undergraduate classes, (ii) continued emphasis on inclusion of under-represented groups within our research efforts and (iii) outreach activities to Atlanta-based historically black colleges and universities.","title":"NR: Design and Evaluation of Retrieval Functions in Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Systems","awardID":"0240485","effectiveDate":"2003-10-01","expirationDate":"2007-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["550428","550429"],"PO":["7594"]},"86492":{"abstract":"Wavescalar, A New Approach to Scalable System Design<br\/><br\/>Abstract<br\/><br\/>At the center of our modern society is the rapid growth and pervasiveness of Information Technology (IT).

A second generation \"Semantic Web\" is being built by adding semantic annotations that machines can understand and from which humans can benefit. Modeling, discovering and reasoning about complex relationships on the Semantic Web will enable this vision and transform the hunt for documents into a more automated analysis enabled by semantic technology. The beginnings of this shift from search to analysis can be observed in research and industry as users look beyond finding relevant documents based on keywords to finding actionable information leading to decision making and insights. Large scale semantic annotation of data (both domain-independent and domain-specific) is now possible because of an accumulation of advances in entity identification, automatic classification, taxonomy and ontology development, and metadata extraction. The next frontier, which fundamentally changes the way we acquire and use knowledge, is to automatically identify complex relationships between entities in this semantically annotated data. Instead of a search engine that returns documents containing terms of interest, there will be a system that returns actionable information (with the associated sources and supporting evidence) to a user or application. The user interacts with information universe through a hypothesis driven approach that combines search and inferencing, enabling more complex analysis and deeper insight. The research will focus on the design, prototyping and evaluation of a system, called SemDIS (Semantic Discovery) that supports indexing and querying of complex semantic relationships and is driven by notions of information trust and provenance and models of hypotheses and arguments under investigation. Such a capability greatly enhances the capacity of intelligence analysts to obtain (in time) information leading to a more secure homeland and world.

Continuing technological advances in fluorescence and atomic-force microscopy allow scientists to observe molecular function, distribution, and interrelationships in living cells. However, a full understanding of tens of thousands of proteins and the complex molecular processes they engage in requires a voluminous amount of image data, which currently must be analyzed by visual inspection. To facilitate such an analysis, researchers from the four participating institutions are focusing on three main research thrusts. First, next-generation intelligent imaging involves information processing at the sensor level to enable high-speed and super-resolution imaging. The goal is to enable biologists to study cellular processes at resolutions in time and space that are not possible with current technologies. The second research thrust is pattern recognition and data mining as applied to bio-molecular image collections. Salient features that characterize the underlying patterns in cells and tissues need to be computed for the vast volumes of images acquired through automated microscopy. Third, a distributed database of bio-molecular images is being created. The merging of pattern-recognition and data-mining tools with new, powerful methods for indexing, data modeling, and collaboration, is aimed at creating a unique infrastructure that greatly facilitates image bioinformatics, thus complementing recent revolutionary advances in genomics. <br\/><br\/>The outcome of this research will lead to new and novel information-processing methods for bio-molecular image data.

During its five-year duration, this project will develop, test, and deploy a distributed database of bio-molecular image data accessible to researchers around the world. The impact of the distributed database will be through large-scale biology in which the results of a single experiment can be globally correlated with the results from other groups of scientists, thus accelerating discovery of dynamic relationships between structure and function in complex biological systems.<br\/><br\/>The project will develop new courses, and will facilitate student exchanges, semi-annual meetings, and workshops, benefiting students at all levels. This project will train a new generation of biologists, computer scientists and engineers well versed in the imaging and information-processing sciences at the forefront of next-generation biotechnology. Partnership will be established with institutions with large populations of students from groups underrepresented in science and engineering, such as the California State Universities at Fresno and San Bernardino and the Universidad Metropolitan in Puerto Rico, for undergraduate recruitment and outreach. An effective mode of outreach for students is to educate their teachers, and the project will offer summer fellowships for elementary, high-school, college, and university teachers.","title":"Information Technology Research (ITR): Next-Generation Bio-Molecular Imaging and Information Discovery","awardID":"0331697","effectiveDate":"2003-10-01","expirationDate":"2010-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7294","name":"SCIENCE & ENGINEERING INFORMAT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"7373","name":"ITR-INFORMATION INTEGRATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0804","name":"Division of EMERGING FRONTIERS","abbr":"EF"},"pgm":{"id":"1688","name":"ITR LARGE GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0804","name":"Division of EMERGING FRONTIERS","abbr":"EF"},"pgm":{"id":"7275","name":"CROSS-EF ACTIVITIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0804","name":"Division of EMERGING FRONTIERS","abbr":"EF"},"pgm":{"id":"7314","name":"ITR FOR NATIONAL PRIORITIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0808","name":"Division of BIOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"DBI"},"pgm":{"id":"1144","name":"Biomolecular Dynam,Struc,Func"}}],"PIcoPI":["320722","426601","536697","550914","426604"],"PO":["564395"]},"86493":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>0325639<br\/>Goldsmith, Andrea<br\/>Stanford University<br\/><br\/>An ad-hoc wireless network is a collection of possibly mobile wireless nodes that self-configure to form a<br\/>network without the aid of any established infrastructure.

Algorithms for textual search, such as string matching for<br\/>keyword searches, are well understood.

We hypothesize that there exists a way to conservatively and efficiently <br\/>encode meta-opacity of a convex-shaped volume block for a range of views under a <br\/>family of transfer functions via a one-time pre-computation. We call such encoding <br\/>the Plenoptic Opacity Function (POF). Using POF for conservative run-time opacity <br\/>estimation, great accelerations by visibility culling in volume rendering can be <br\/>accomplished while the transfer function can be modified within the same family on <br\/>the fly. Here we test this hypothesis and apply POF to volume rendering in <br\/>large-scale parallelism, as well as out-of-core visualization.","title":"Visualization: Plenoptic Opacity Function for Large Date Visualization","awardID":"0329323","effectiveDate":"2003-10-15","expirationDate":"2006-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7453","name":"GRAPHICS & VISUALIZATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["533228","513541"],"PO":["532791"]},"88167":{"abstract":"WHYNET: Scalable Testbed for Next Generation Mobile Wireless Networking Technologies<br\/>The next generation of wireless communication technology is likely to rely on cross-layer interactions<br\/>that extend from the application layer down to the physical devices.

The hybrid testbed will be a networked federation of geographically<br\/>distributed, heterogeneous wireless physical testbeds with multiple protocol stacks (CDMA 2000 cellular and IP), next generation physical technologies including UWB (Ultra Wide Band), MIMO (Multiple Inputs,<br\/>Multiple Outputs) and SDR (Software Defined Radios), and a parallel & distributed multi-tool simulation<br\/>framework. Beyond providing a more accurate & flexible evaluation framework, the hybrid testbed will<br\/>facilitate a smooth transition from an abstract simulation model to an operational implementation within a<br\/>single framework. For instance, protocol prototypes can communicate with simulated lower layers for<br\/>repeatable results, or receive and process variable rate real multimedia application inputs for perceptual<br\/>evaluation. Once the physical hardware devices are ready for testing, a portion of the target network system<br\/>can be configured with real devices while the rest of the network can still reside in the simulated hardware<br\/>domain. The effort will also generate a repository of wireless networking scenarios, measurements, models<br\/>and implementations. A representative set of studies will be used to demonstrate the unique contributions of<br\/>WHYNET for cross-layer optimization studies in particular, and mobile wireless networking in general.

Biologists have a rich array of quantitative tools for analyzing the genetics and evolution of traits, provided the traits can be described by one or a few measurements. However, many complex traits of central importance in basic and applied biology are defined quantitatively by mathematical functions, and few methods exist for their analysis. These function-valued traits include gene expression profiles, life history patterns, two- and three-dimensional morphological shapes, and phenotypic responses to continuous environmental gradients. Empiricists are becoming increasingly interested in function-valued traits, but their studies have generated an expanding range of unresolved practical and theoretical questions. To address these issues, this award will integrate approaches from several disciplines, including statistics, mathematical modeling, and biology. Specifically, the work will lead to a comprehensive framework of statistical tools and mathematical models for analyzing function-valued traits. The framework will be used to address major questions in seven model empirical systems that span a broad spectrum of natural, field, and laboratory systems. These investigations will produce an extensive set of empirical results for new and existing data, statistical methods, and mathematical theory. An easy to use software package will also be developed for biologists whose research involves questions about variation, selection, and evolution of function-valued traits.<br\/>Expected broader impacts: Methodologies developed in this proposal can be applied to any area of biology concerned with variation of complex traits. Besides evolutionary biology, this includes applied fields such as medical genetics, agriculture, wildlife management, global change, and conservation genetics. The scope of this project would include molecular, quantitative, and ecological genetics in plant and animal systems, statistical analysis, and mathematical modeling. As such, the proposed crosscutting research and training strategy will provide an outstanding opportunity to train undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, and established researchers who span a wide range of scientific fields and approaches in virtually all the skills of contemporary evolutionary biology.","title":"Function-valued Traits in Natural Populations: Variation, Selection, and Evolution","awardID":"0328594","effectiveDate":"2003-10-01","expirationDate":"2009-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0703","name":"Division of CIVIL, MECHANICAL, & MANUFACT","abbr":"CMMI"},"pgm":{"id":"1266","name":"APPLIED MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0804","name":"Division of EMERGING FRONTIERS","abbr":"EF"},"pgm":{"id":"7275","name":"CROSS-EF ACTIVITIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0809","name":"Division of INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYS","abbr":"IOS"},"pgm":{"id":"1329","name":"PLANT GENOME RESEARCH PROJECT"}}],"PIcoPI":["457467",227853],"PO":["293593"]},"87552":{"abstract":"A national glass fiber network to serve 100 million households with two-way<br\/>symmetric data communications service at 100 Mb\/sec per household will<br\/>inevitably be constructed during the next few years.

The molecular interaction maps involved in many important cellular processes often resemble circuit diagrams, and this analogy highlights the motivation for a quantitative description of gene regulation. An electrical circuit is invariably accompanied by a set of equations which faithfully describe its functionality, and it is built from knowledge of the properties of the individual components (resistors, capacitors, inductors, etc.) to provide a framework for predicting the circuit behavior resulting from component modifications. An acceptable model describing a given molecular interaction map should be similarly built from knowledge of the basic regulatory themes in order to enable the prediction of the effects of genetic perturbations of the system. <br\/><br\/>This project focuses on the construction and utilization of genetic \"circuits\" for dissecting, analyzing, and controlling the dynamical interactions involved in gene regulation. Previous investigations of engineered gene circuits have included the development of positive feedback and co-repressive switching networks, as well as an oscillating circuit. These previous studies have explored several of the building-block modules that constitute large-scale genomic wiring, and thus represent a first step towards an understanding of whole-genome regulatory complexity. The current project will build upon these previous studies by designing and constructing higher order networks consisting of coupled genetic regulatory modules. Specifically, the investigators will model and construct a regulatory network which couples a co-repressive module with an unregulated constitutive module, and explore how such coupling can induce oscillations in a toggle switch. As a second project, they plan to model and construct a synthetic network which couples the phase oscillator known as the \"repressilator\" with a relaxation oscillator module, and explore the synchronization properties of the coupled oscillator system. This approach could lead to an experimentally validated set of mathematical rules for understanding the complex circuitry of whole-genome regulatory processes. <br\/><br\/>The top-down approaches, which are used by many investigators to analyze the expression states of thousands of genes, have contributed towards understanding the global patterns of gene expression and assessing gene lethality. The bottom-up approach to be used in this project, which reduces the complexity of these gene networks to their essential components, will lead to the modular dissection of network architectures and refined descriptions of gene expression dynamics. The combination of these two complementary approaches will eventually lead to the elucidation of the organization and functioning of gene regulatory networks. In addition, work stemming from this research should enhance the ability to utilize synthetic gene networks as new logical forms of cellular control, and could in turn lead to important applications in functional genomics, nanotechnology, and gene and cell therapies.","title":"QSB: The Design and Construction of Coupled Genetic Regulatory Modules","awardID":"0331285","effectiveDate":"2003-10-01","expirationDate":"2006-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0709","name":"Division of BIOENGINEERING & ENVIRON SYSTE","abbr":"BES"},"pgm":{"id":"1491","name":"BIOTECH, BIOCHEM & BIOMASS ENG"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0807","name":"Division of MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOSCIE","abbr":"MCB"},"pgm":{"id":"1112","name":"Genetic Mechanisms"}}],"PIcoPI":["488305","488306"],"PO":["324446"]},"87112":{"abstract":"Robotics and Computer Vision Program<br\/><br\/>ABSTRACT<br\/><br\/><br\/>Proposal #: 0328802<br\/>Title: Nonseparable Multiclass Learning for Object Tracking<br\/>PI: Shen, Xiaotong<br\/>Ohio State Univ Res Fdn<br\/><br\/>Object tracking is an important technology of image and video processing for many applications, including vision-guided automation, automatic target identification, object-based video compression, and face recognition.

While diverse in application, these<br\/>thrusts represent a common core of intellectual thrusts that integrate<br\/>computer science, control, and communications.<br\/><br\/>The results of the proposed research are being evaluated on two testbeds<br\/>already at Caltech. The first is the Multi-Vehicle Wireless Testbed, which<br\/>provides a distributed environment for control of 8-10 vehicles performing<br\/>cooperative tasks in a real-time environment. The second is the WAN in Lab,<br\/>a wide area network consisting of high speed servers, programmable routers,<br\/>electronic crossconnects, and long haul fibers with associated optical<br\/>amplifiers, dispersion compensation modules and optical multiplexers.<br\/><br\/>The project is also developing elements of a curriculum that will provide<br\/>training to students in information systems that blends communications,<br\/>computation, and control. This includes integration our the research<br\/>framework into a recently created course at Caltech on the principles of<br\/>feedback and control, CDS 101, as well as development a second course, IST<br\/>201, aimed at bringing together faculty and students interested in working<br\/>on problems at the boundaries of these traditional disciplines.","title":"ITR: Information Dynamics for Networked Feedback Systems","awardID":"0326554","effectiveDate":"2003-10-15","expirationDate":"2008-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["550549","549583","551140","564049","451966"],"PO":["561889"]},"86662":{"abstract":"A computer program is written in a high-level *programming* *language*,<br\/>but to be run, it must be translated into a *machine* *language*.<br\/>A translator is difficult and expensive to build, and using today's<br\/>techniques, each programming language needs its own translator.

In the distributed realm, there are sensor networks, location-aware devices, and intelligent appliances, which require decentralized processing and robust communication via streams. In the embedded domain, there are handheld computers and cell phones which process data streams under tight resource con-straints. There are also high-performance applications such as software routers, cell phone base stations, and radar image processing, in which the stream abstraction must be mapped efficiently to the latest supercomputers. In all, we believe that streams will be the cornerstone of next-generation software.<br\/><br\/>The goal of the StreamIt project is to establish a high-level programming paradigm for the streaming domain. In all of the applications listed above, there are intense demands on the programmer. StreamIt provides a high-level stream language in which the inherent complexities of the domain are handled by a stream-aware compiler. A program is written as a set of autonomous filters, each of which contains its own memory and communicates with its neighbors through data channels. This exposes the parallelism and communication patterns, giving more power to the compiler. We believe that this will lead to a dramatic improvement in programmer productivity, program robustness, and portability in three distinct communities.<br\/><br\/>The first target is heterogeneous distributed computing, in which unreliable devices are communicating in ad-hoc networks with applications spread across multiple nodes. To address the challenge of partitioning a program across multiple nodes, StreamIt provides a \"single machine abstraction\" to the programmer. Filters are specified at the granularity of the algorithm, and the compiler maps them to nodes according to run-time resource constraints. StreamIt will also provide high-level support for fault-tolerance. If an unreliable node fails, a lightweight runtime system can leverage static compiler analysis to recover crucial data from a backup node, automatically relocate the computation, and continue processing.<br\/><br\/>The second focus area for StreamIt is domain-specific optimization for the embedded and DSP communities. To eradicate costly hand-written assembly code, StreamIt will include domain-specific code generation strategies such as cache-constrained scheduling, stream-aware storage management, and new calling conventions for stream programs. To lower the expertise needed for high-level algorithm design, StreamIt will also include novel algorithmic transformations such as detection of linear nodes and automated translation to the frequency domain.<br\/><br\/>The third thrust of StreamIt is with regards to high-performance computer architecture. StreamIt aims to provide a common machine language (CML) for the emerging class of communication-exposed machines. Just as C was a CML for von-Neumann architectures, StreamIt will hide the variations from one machine from another while capturing the properties that are important for obtaining performance. This will provide the foundation for a portable programming model for communication-exposed machines.<br\/><br\/>A final focus of StreamIt is one that interweaves through all of the preceding themes: a full characterization and understanding of the streaming application domain. The project will include the study and implementation of a wide range of state-of-the-art stream algorithms, thereby exposing their common properties and providing a framework for future research on stream languages and compilation.<br\/><br\/>To show the feasibility of this project, we have created a prototype version of the StreamIt language, a large collection of streaming programs written in StreamIt, a compiler that maps StreamIt to uniprocessors, and an optimizing compiler that maps StreamIt onto the Raw communication-exposed architecture.","title":"ITR: A Language, Compilers and Tools for the Streaming Application Domain","awardID":"0325297","effectiveDate":"2003-10-01","expirationDate":"2009-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["467768","547366","382922"],"PO":["561889"]},"88774":{"abstract":"Pathways to STEM Careers: Preparing the STEM Workforce of the 21st Century<br\/> Project Summary<br\/><br\/>Support is requested to organize and conduct an NSF-sponsored Workforce E-Forum followed by a two-day workshop to explore the existing knowledge base on STEM workforce issues with the goal of setting research priorities for the future. <br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: The project's intellectual merit lies in its multimodal and inclusive approach of building on previous research to gather information, promote interdisciplinary discussion, and set a strategic research agenda. A major component of the workshop will be a discussion of existing research findings and programs related to workforce issues.

Information technology is pervasive throughout this process. Before beginning the laboratory work, computation is necessary for planning the experiment, and for later analysis of the results. In gene chip experiments for determining gene activity levels, planning issues include which biological hypotheses should be considered and what chemical conditions will yield the most informative results, followed by computation to reduce the collected data, which can be gigabytes of information, to forms that can be understood and exploited by biological scientists. In electron microscope experiments for determining the 3-D structure of viruses, planning issues include electron energy, defocus level, beam current, number of tilts, and tilt angles, followed by computation to reduce the measured data, which can be one hundred thousand or more images, to a biologically-plausible 3-D structure. Historically, insufficient attention has been devoted to the use of highly sophisticated information technology for quantitative planning and analysis of experiments, which jointly takes into account the behavior of the measurement apparatus, the goals of the experiment, the unavoidable uncertainty in the system, and the algorithmic complexity that a particular experimental design implies for the subsequent computational analysis of the experimental data. The research objective of this ITR project is to bring together a team of investigators from MIT, Purdue and NYU-Courant along with their industrial collaborators to apply principles from information, coding and systems theory, along with advanced computational methods for statistical inference and numerical optimization, to create a unified approach to planning and analysis of complex quantitative experiments in the biological sciences, such as the determination of gene expression using gene chips and the determination of 3-D viral structure from scattering and electron microscopy experiments. These biological problems will challenge the state of the art in information technology and an important characteristic of the project is the parallel development of new information technology and new biological applications. The human-resources objectives of this ITR project are to provide the opportunity for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates to learn about and contribute to this exciting area at the interface between information technology and biological sciences.

In fact, the number of end-user programmers in the United States is expected to reach 55 million by 2005, as compared to only 2.75 million professional programmers. The programming systems used by these end users include spreadsheet systems, web authoring tools, and graphical languages for demonstrating the desired behavior of educational simulations. Using such systems, end users create software, in forms such as educational simulations, spreadsheets, and dynamic e-business web applications. Unfortunately, however, errors are pervasive in end-user software, and the resulting impact is sometimes enormous. When the software end users create is not dependable, there can be serious consequences for the people whose retirement funds, credit histories, e-business revenues, and even health and safety rely on decisions made based on that software.<br\/>To address this problem, we propose a fundamental paradigm shift to a new way of thinking about the way end users create software.

The ease of experimenting with new<br\/>transport protocols in a realistic setting will lower the research barrier, helping a larger pool of researchers (and particularly minority institutions) to compete more on the basis of their ideas and less on the level of deployment resources they are able to muster. The researchers expect there to be a strong educational component of this work, since students as well as researchers can safely experiment without concern for adversely impacting the network, even on generic, shared machines. Real deployment, perhaps solving real problems, can occur among fellow students, and is ultimately limited only by a protocol's value and the students' ability to publicize it. Thus will students, and researchers, be empowered and motivated.","title":"SP: Collaborative Research: Rapid Evolution of Transport Protocols","awardID":"0338785","effectiveDate":"2003-10-01","expirationDate":"2008-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["344532"],"PO":["434241"]},"87246":{"abstract":"Detection of biological attack is a critical element in civilian biodefense. Various approaches<br\/>to such detection have been proposed, including periodic sample analysis, and use of biological sensors, e.g.,<br\/>fluorescence-based. Sample collection methods can provide the needed specificity and sensitivity, however they are time-consuming and costly. Faster-acting (e.g., fluorescence) biological sensors offer lower specificity and sensitivity. Consequently, detection of bioattacks using traditional sensing methods is constrained by serious tradeoffs involving significant attack-to-detection delays, high false-alarm rates, and excessive costs. Therefore, new paradigms for bioattack detection are of paramount importance, especially for such large-scale civilian biodefense applications as protection of urban transport systems (e.g., subways), airports and other public facilities. This proposal concentrates on a novel paradigm for bioattack detection, based on multisensor information fusion.<br\/><br\/>Objectives and methods. Detection of biological attack is in essence a recognition problem where the<br\/>attack\/no-attack decision is based on the sensor information. The proposed research concentrates on methods for fusion of information from multiple sensors within a network, to boost performance beyond the levels offered by any sensor separately. Multisensor data fusion should be considered as a key enabling technology for biological sensor networks. While topics such as delivery of data from multiple sensors, associated network protocols and databases, have received attention, including other network application domains, methods for robust combining of multisensor information present within such networks have not been adequately addressed. Multisensor information fusion is a critical part of the recognition process, i.e., as the task of intelligent aggregation of information within and as part of the reasoning process to achieve an emergent behavior conclusions regarding the phenomena to be recognized (in this case the biological attack occurrences) that would be unattainable from either single sources or from simple information superposition approaches. The multisensor information fusion techniques are thus a crucial enabling element that will allow exploiting to the fullest extent the information present in biological sensor<br\/>networks.<br\/><br\/>The proposed research addresses cardinal problems of information fusion, in particular information uncertainty and disparity, in the setting of biodefense-oriented automatic decision-making. Novel techniques for biodefense multisensor information fusion, based on uncertainty calculi (e.g., Dempster-Shafer theory) and advanced pattern recognition (e.g., Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory), will be investigated. The effort will use biosensor data collected previously by MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT\/LL) as well as data that will be collected within the proposed effort.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual merit. Offering novel techniques for exploitation of multisensor information in the decisionmaking process, the proposed research will contribute to advancing state of the art in both the bioattack detection domain and in the domain of multisensor-based automatic recognition in general. While biodefense sensing will be the focus of this research, the multisensor information fusion techniques developed are expected to be applicable to a range of other sensing applications. Moreover, the developed information fusion techniques will not be constrained to a specific sensor suite. Therefore, their value will not be diminished by development of more robust sensors. Rather, these methods will be able to take advantage of the increased performance of future more robust sensors. (In fact, a likely byproduct of the proposed effort will be the insight into mutual value of various information sources, valuable for improving future sensor designs.) Thus, in summary, the multisensor information fusion techniques investigated within this proposal offer the prospect to attain performance levels beyond any nonideal single sensor constituents, and thus will likely become a vital enabling element of future biodefense systems.<br\/><br\/>The proposal authors' prior research in biodefense, sensor information fusion, and pattern recognition, form a solid basis for the proposed effort. In addition, MIT\/LL team is in a unique position to undertake this research, because of unique access to biodefense sensor data stemming from other MIT\/LL biodefense programs and from the development of MIT\/LL's own biological-agent sensors.<br\/><br\/>Broader impacts.

Other technical agenda items include (1)<br\/>accessibility and reliability of distributed data (2) operating on<br\/>encrypted databases, (3) remote control of data, (4) repelling hostile<br\/>data, and (5) auditability of data-management systems. Because these<br\/>technical goals are affected by lack of agreement about the meanings<br\/>of basic terms, most notably \"privacy,\" a major goal of the project is<br\/>the development of a conceptual framework for the study of rights,<br\/>responsibilities, and public policies focused on sensitive-data<br\/>handling. This part of the project incorporates the notion of<br\/>\"contextual integrity,\" which considers both the context and the<br\/>content of data sets in assessing sensitivity.<br\/><br\/>Projected outcomes of the project include a next generation of<br\/>technology for handling sensitive information that is qualitatively<br\/>better than the current generation's and an effective conceptual<br\/>framework for policy making and philosophical inquiry into the rights<br\/>and responsibilities of data subjects, data owners, and data users.","title":"Information Technology Research (ITR): Sensitive Information in a Wired World","awardID":"0331580","effectiveDate":"2003-10-01","expirationDate":"2010-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1688","name":"ITR LARGE GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["461864"],"PO":["529429"]},"88754":{"abstract":"0338546 <br\/>Lillian Cassel<br\/>Association Computing Machinery <br\/><br\/>Title: \"All in the Family: A Unified Representation of the Computing and Information Related Disciplines\" <br\/>$71,000 <br\/><br\/><br\/>This is a project, sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery, that involves developing a computing-topics classification and visualization scheme that is both comprehensive and dynamic.

Information technology is pervasive throughout this process. Before beginning the laboratory work, computation is necessary for planning the experiment, and for later analysis of the results. In gene chip experiments for determining gene activity levels, planning issues include which biological hypotheses should be considered and what chemical conditions will yield the most informative results, followed by computation to reduce the collected data, which can be gigabytes of information, to forms that can be understood and exploited by biological scientists. In electron microscope experiments for determining the 3-D structure of viruses, planning issues include electron energy, defocus level, beam current, number of tilts, and tilt angles, followed by computation to reduce the measured data, which can be one hundred thousand or more images, to a biologically-plausible 3-D structure. Historically, insufficient attention has been devoted to the use of highly sophisticated information technology for quantitative planning and analysis of experiments, which jointly takes into account the behavior of the measurement apparatus, the goals of the experiment, the unavoidable uncertainty in the system, and the algorithmic complexity that a particular experimental design implies for the subsequent computational analysis of the experimental data. The research objective of this ITR project is to bring together a team of investigators from MIT, Purdue and NYU-Courant along with their industrial collaborators to apply principles from information, coding and systems theory, along with advanced computational methods for statistical inference and numerical optimization, to create a unified approach to planning and analysis of complex quantitative experiments in the biological sciences, such as the determination of gene expression using gene chips and the determination of 3-D viral structure from scattering and electron microscopy experiments. These biological problems will challenge the state of the art in information technology and an important characteristic of the project is the parallel development of new information technology and new biological applications. The human-resources objectives of this ITR project are to provide the opportunity for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates to learn about and contribute to this exciting area at the interface between information technology and biological sciences.

A single operating system<br\/>error can crash a machine. A single security hole can compromise the integrity of an entire system or, as<br\/>software and its errors is replicated, the integrity of entire networks. This proposal focuses on practical<br\/>techniques to prevent such software errors. Its approach is based on the insight that software is governed<br\/>by many design rules, from general ones that programs should not overrun their buffers, to application specific rules such as a begin-transaction must be invoked before a commit-transaction in a database,<br\/>and low-level rules, such as the input strings to strncpy should not overlap. Unlike specifications such as<br\/>loop invariants, pre-conditions and post-conditions that pertain to particular lines of code, design rules are<br\/>more powerful, succinct, and are applicable to large amounts of code in the program. While design rules are<br\/>pervasive, in practice they are neither well documented nor automatically enforced, yet programmers need<br\/>to understand and obey them to write correct programs.<br\/>Intellectual Merit. The goal of this work is to make design rules first-class objects. They should be<br\/>explicitly part of program design, form a core part of the intellectual framework of system implementors, and be effectively supported by techniques that have teeth. This proposal provides a comprehensive approach to reach these goals. It is expected to make the following major contributions:<br\/>1. General theory of design rules in software development. It will provide a deeper understanding of how<br\/>software is governed by design rules, what these rules are, and how they can be used in practice. The<br\/>intent is to teach this concept to all computer science students.<br\/>2. Automatic design rule inference. Real systems have thousands of design rules, buried in millions of<br\/>lines of code. Expecting programmers to reliably specify all rules is unrealistic. Depending on them to<br\/>do so is dangerous since an omitted rule will not be checked. This research will develop techniques to<br\/>automatically extract design rules from code. It uses the fact that the same rule is obeyed many times<br\/>in a program, allowing it to be inferred by observing regularities in the program's static and dynamic<br\/>behavior. The challenge in the approach is inferring subtle patterns from noisy behavior. This research<br\/>will develop a general theory of design rule extraction.<br\/>3. Programming tools for design rules. This research will develop practical tools that automatically extract<br\/>design rules, check programs for design-rule violations, and also enforce design rules in programs.<br\/>While the work will support general-purpose software, it will also pay particular attention to tools for<br\/>detecting both security and non-deterministic errors (such as race conditions).<br\/>4. Fundamental static program analysis. Design-rule conformance testing requires sophisticated program<br\/>analysis. This research is expected to advance the state of the art in program analyses of contextsensitive<br\/>pointer aliases and object invariants.<br\/>5. Software model checking of design rules. Some rules require deeper analysis than static analysis can<br\/>provide. This research will support such rules by developing a software model checker that checks<br\/>actual implementation code (rather than an abstracted specification of it) against programmer-supplied<br\/>invariants or other implementations.<br\/>6. Testing based on design rules. This research intends to improve testing by leveraging expressed and<br\/>extracted design rules to guide test coverage, test selection and test generation.","title":"ITR: Software Design Rules","awardID":"0326227","effectiveDate":"2003-10-01","expirationDate":"2007-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["448745","382726"],"PO":["564388"]},"86379":{"abstract":"Self-organizing particle systems consist of numerous autonomous \"particles\" (individuals) that move through space in a coordinated fashion, guided by influences that they exert on one another.

COD will support secure isolation of multiple user communities, pushbutton control over software environments subject to appropriate authorization controls, and dynamic policy-based resource provisioning. The COD design leverages widely used open-source components to support diverse hardware platforms and software configurations, and to evolve rapidly with new technology. The project will develop a COD software release integrated with other components of the NMI software suite, and evaluate it through test deployments at Duke University and MCNC, with grid connections to the NC BioGrid.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact - The project will facilitate the deployment of clusters to advance science and education, reduce costs and improve return on investments in cluster infrastructure, and remove key barriers to sharing cluster resources across organizational boundaries. The project will also provide research experiences for graduate students and promote participation by underrepresented groups. Among the students participating in the project are two female PhD students. The project will also create opportunities for Duke's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program to mentor underrepresented undergraduates (primarily African-Americans) during summer internships.","title":"NMI: Collaborative Research: A Grid Service for Dynamic Virtual

by sensors that are very constrained in their information-gathering capacities and that acquire data only at a relatively small number of distinct, widely-separated locations. This severly limits the ability to characterize an environment, to then model it, and to subsequently provide accurate information for policy decisions relating to its management. The Networked Infomechanical Systems (NIMS) program introduces a revolutionary new class of mobile distributed sensors that are networked both physically by infrastructure and electronically to enable monitoring and interaction with the full three-dimensional environments in which biological and other systems exist. NIMS sensors measure changes in the environment, autonomously move to locations of particular interest, collaborate to exploit diverse sensing modalities (imagery, acoustic, chemical and meteorological, etc.) in the detection and characterization of events, and learn from the collective experience of the network.<br\/><br\/>With members from the University of California, Los Angeles, Merced, and Riverside, and the University of Southern California, the NIMS team brings information technology experts in computer science, information theory, robotics, signal processing, and networked embedded computing together with biologists and public health specialists. The initial demonstration applications of NIMS will focus on 1) monitoring of global change indicators in a mountain riparian stream canyon and 2) detection of biological pathogens in coastal waters and urban rivers. However, the techniques being developed apply across an extremely wide range of environments and applications and have the potental to broadly impact science, policy, and national security. The NIMS program also enables an engaging, explorative Grade 6-8 science instruction program with both hands-on science and remote network access to NIMS.","title":"Information Technology Research (ITR): Networked Infomechanical Systems (NIMS)","awardID":"0331481","effectiveDate":"2003-10-01","expirationDate":"2009-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1688","name":"ITR LARGE GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["560926","539241","539242","556478",229082],"PO":["565090"]},"86413":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>0325273<br\/>Margaret Burnett<br\/>Oregon State U<br\/><br\/>There has been considerable work in empowering end users to be able to write their own programs, and as a<br\/>result, users are indeed doing so. In fact, the number of end-user programmers in the United States is expected to reach 55 million by 2005, as compared to only 2.75 million professional programmers. The programming systems used by these end users include spreadsheet systems, web authoring tools, and graphical languages for demonstrating the desired behavior of educational simulations. Using such systems, end users create software, in forms such as educational simulations, spreadsheets, and dynamic e-business web applications. Unfortunately, however, errors are pervasive in end-user software, and the resulting impact is sometimes enormous. When the software end users create is not dependable, there can be serious consequences for the people whose retirement funds, credit histories, e-business revenues, and even health and safety rely on decisions made based on that software.<br\/>To address this problem, we propose a fundamental paradigm shift to a new way of thinking about the way<br\/>end users create software. Our intent is to address the following research question:<br\/>Is it possible to bring the bene.ts of rigorous software engineering methodologies to end users?<br\/>We do not propose to transform end users into engineers. Rather, our plan is to enable systems to create<br\/>software to collaborate with those users, in a software development paradigm that combines traditionally separate functions blending speci.cation, design, implementation, component integration, debugging, testing, and maintenance into tightly integrated, highly interactive environments. These environments will employ new, incremental, feedback devices supported by analysis and inferential reasoning to help the user reason about the dependability of their software as they work with it, in a manner that respects the user's problem-solving directions to an extent unprecedented in existing software development environments.","title":"ITR: Collaborative Research: Dependable End-User Software","awardID":"0325273","effectiveDate":"2003-10-15","expirationDate":"2009-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["548135",225815,"548132","548134"],"PO":["564388"]},"86534":{"abstract":"Abstract<br\/>Researchers at The University of Michigan, Arizona State University, and Princeton University<br\/>will, during the next four years, explore core technologies for the next generation of computer<br\/>systems, suitable for untethered pervasive computing.

The two techniques, each a major investigative avenue in itself, are complementary in several fundamental ways. The goal of this project is, for the first time, to harness the complementary strengths of these two physics-based methods. The PIs will do so by unifying them under a biology-based control paradigm derived from the emerging field of artificial life. The unification will lead to a novel breed of intelligent, deformable organisms capable of performing a wide range of challenging data analysis tasks, such as image segmentation and data reconstruction, in a highly automated fashion. The intellectual merit of the research is the goal of incorporating within an ultimately symbolic control hierarchy, two fundamentally numeric methods, the first related to the continuum mechanics of solids, the second related to liquids. Hence, deformable models maintain their topological structure as they evolve, while level set methods are topologically adaptive. Enabling these methods seamlessly to join forces within a rigorous mathematical and tractable computational foundation is an intellectually challenging problem. The research team, whose expertise spans the computational and mathematical sciences and includes the inventors of deformable models and level set methods, is uniquely qualified to meet this challenge. The anticipated outcome is a new, highly automated methodology for analyzing large-scale datasets that are subject to uncertainty and noise.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This work will streamline the entire visual information processing pipeline. It will be possible to deploy the novel models to be developed by the PIs in massive datasets to automatically extract geometric boundaries and to discover the unknown topology of structures of interest within the data, with immediate applications to medical image analysis, as well as to modeling and rendering tasks. The research team will incorporate the newly developed theory and algorithms into the graduate curricula of their respective institutions, and they will also seek collaborations with industry to provide the longer-term financial support for technology transfer of the prototype software.","title":"ITR: Intelligent Deformable Models","awardID":"0326388","effectiveDate":"2003-10-15","expirationDate":"2008-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["487144","467067","416071","402737"],"PO":["565227"]},"86469":{"abstract":"There is a host of existing and newly-emerging applications that require sophisticated and timely processing of fast, high-volume data streams.

In particular, the project will develop novel stream-oriented languages, query execution and optimization techniques, and resource allocation algorithms. The project will also address the challenges and opportunities that arise in distributed stream processing by addressing issues such as stream-oriented load sharing, dynamic operator placement, and high availability.

Current approaches to automated methods for analyzing and classifying animal vocalizations are still significantly behind the capabilities that exist in the field of human speech processing, and cross-fertilization with other fields offers a tremendous opportunity for making advancements in this area. The PI and his team plan to employ an innovative cross-disciplinary strategy to develop a framework based on robust feature analysis and selection and Hidden Markov Model classification, with additional expertise drawn from such fields as psychology, biology, linguistics, machine learning, and signal processing, for the purpose of making significant advancements to the current state-of-the-art in bioacoustics algorithms and animal communications research. The algorithms developed through this process will be applied to a wide range of important tasks, including automatic vocalization classification and labeling, individual identification, call type classification, behavioral-vocalization correlations, stress analysis, language acquisition, and seismic infrasonic communication. Species being targeted for study include domestic and agricultural animals, marine mammals, and several endangered species. The primary contribution of this work will be the development of well-founded models and methods for improving our understanding of animal communication and behavior. Experimental tasks of significance to a wide variety of research problems within this field are also planned. In addition, many aspects of the HMM classification framework, including hierarchical feature analysis and selection, variable frame sizing, and learnable model topologies, offer the potential for advances in machine learning as well as speech and signal processing. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The development of an easily adaptable framework for applying speech-processing techniques to animal vocalizations will allow other researchers to create systems that pertain to the specific species they are studying. This will speed the development effort of these systems and allow those not familiar with speech and signal processing techniques to incorporate advanced methods in their research. A primary underlying motivation for such research is the preservation of endangered species and the improvement of careand habitats for animals in captivity, and this project has the potential for significant, long-term impact toward these goals.","title":"The Dr. Dolittle Project: A Framework for Classification and Understanding of Animal Vocalizations","awardID":"0326395","effectiveDate":"2003-10-01","expirationDate":"2009-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7496","name":"COLLABORATIVE SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":[226577,226578,226579,"551035",226581],"PO":["565227"]},"86514":{"abstract":"Abstract<br\/>Researchers at The University of Michigan, Arizona State University, and Princeton University<br\/>will, during the next four years, explore core technologies for the next generation of computer<br\/>systems, suitable for untethered pervasive computing.

In such environments, allowing users to roam seamlessly between multiple types of networks creates problems for network security. There is currently no means to transfer the identity or trust record of a user that roams between networks. For example, in 2G and 3G cellular systems, the authentication of mobile users is accomplished through user registration. However, current registration techniques assume a centralized authentication authority, which is not suitable for the distributed, multi-network environment. In addition, registration research traditionally focuses on location update and paging schemes, leaving the new authentication and security issues unresolved. This proposal addresses the problem of inter-system authentication in multi-network environments, by following the research agenda in the design and architectural dimensioning of an inter-system authentication agent (ISA), as well as in the design of the so-called passport and visa mechanism to issue permissions (or service denials) to roaming users. In addition, the project will develop an inter-system registration protocol based on the passport\/visa system and evaluate the performance of a cost-benefit analysis for the ISA architecture and the passport\/visa system. This project will advance the field where the authentication of unknown users is an issue. In particular, the success of this project will have an impact on distributed computing research, such as the buying and selling of computing resources over the Internet, shared information grids for scientific and engi-neering applications, and the development of techniques for secure transaction processing.","title":"NR: Distributed Inter-System Authentication Mechanisms for Seamless Roaming in Multi-network Environments","awardID":"0322893","effectiveDate":"2003-10-01","expirationDate":"2006-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["399648","534041"],"PO":["565090"]},"86625":{"abstract":"Future embedded system applications and infrastructures will be<br\/>increasingly dynamic. Moreover, the devices used in such infrastructures<br\/>will vary widely, from sensors and embedded devices, to handhelds, to high end<br\/>server systems, all of which interact continuously in order to collect,<br\/>collate, and deliver information from where it is produced to where it is<br\/>needed. This project addresses the dynamic nature of distributed embedded<br\/>systems, by developing new information technologies that integrate across<br\/>multiple areas of Computer Science, including computer architecture, operating<br\/>and real-time systems, compilers, and middleware. The key intent is to create<br\/>morphable embedded services, that is, services that continuously self-modify<br\/>and adapt in order to meet dynamic application needs and environmental\/resource<br\/>constraints, including power budgets, end-to-end quality of service (QoS) guarantees<br\/>(e.g., timing constraints), and security constraints.<br\/><br\/>There are many Useful examples of morphable services. In limited forms, they<br\/>are already present in today's cellphone platforms, for instance, where end users<br\/>dynamically download new rings or acquire new games (possibly displacing existing<br\/>ones), etc. Service morphing, however, goes much beyond such configuration<br\/>capabilities. Imagine a cellphone, for example, which dynamically morphs into<br\/>an portable wand, using its sensing (e.g., its built-in camera) and<br\/>communication abilities (e.g., by interacting with other nearby phones)<br\/>to guide its owner out of a disaster site. Then, in contrast to such<br\/>functionality-centric morphing, consider this cellphone drawing on the<br\/>power of nearby server systems (or other phones) to provide suitable levels<br\/>of service to its user, despite the fact that its power is running low. This<br\/>can be done, for instance, by dynamically offloading services onto other<br\/>platforms, by (re)partitioning services across the device and cooperating server<br\/>systems, and\/or by deploying more power-efficient and perhaps, less graphics-capable<br\/>service code to the phone itself. Another interesting aspect of our work is its<br\/>ability to go beyond performance and power as the only critical elements of future<br\/>systems. With our approach, for instance, compiler methods and middleware can be used<br\/>to enhance information security rather than system performance. This can be done<br\/>by scattering critical application state to reduce its exposure to<br\/>external intrusions. As a result, information security can become an integral<br\/>element of the QoS needs of applications.<br\/><br\/>A concrete example of security-focused service morphing is to `scatter'<br\/>critical and vulnerable values across multiple cooperating distributed<br\/>platforms and to `assemble' them only to the extent needed by the application<br\/>under compiler control. Moreover, when the last use of the `assembled'<br\/>value is complete, the `assembled' value is destroyed. Each use of an `assembled' value is verified by compiler-generated code that authenticates it. For example, consider the use of last four digits of the social security number<br\/>used for authenticating a transaction. The entire social security number will<br\/>never be stored in a memory location as a value (that could be hacked into).<br\/>The value will be scattered in a form known only to the compiler which it will<br\/>then use to `assemble' the value just in time only for the extent of the use.<br\/><br\/>The different service morphing techniques to be developed in this research<br\/>include dynamic component (re)deployment, (re)specialization, and (re)partitioning.<br\/>Such actions are supported by system-level mechanisms that efficiently carry the<br\/>performance, usage, and requirements information needed for runtime component morphing,<br\/>principally addressing components' processing and communication actions.<br\/>The intent is for self-modifying components to be able to acquire runtime<br\/>information about current resource availabilities and Quality of Service<br\/>demands.

Information technology is pervasive throughout this process. Before beginning the laboratory work, computation is necessary for planning the experiment, and for later analysis of the results. In gene chip experiments for determining gene activity levels, planning issues include which biological hypotheses should be considered and what chemical conditions will yield the most informative results, followed by computation to reduce the collected data, which can be gigabytes of information, to forms that can be understood and exploited by biological scientists. In electron microscope experiments for determining the 3-D structure of viruses, planning issues include electron energy, defocus level, beam current, number of tilts, and tilt angles, followed by computation to reduce the measured data, which can be one hundred thousand or more images, to a biologically-plausible 3-D structure. Historically, insufficient attention has been devoted to the use of highly sophisticated information technology for quantitative planning and analysis of experiments, which jointly takes into account the behavior of the measurement apparatus, the goals of the experiment, the unavoidable uncertainty in the system, and the algorithmic complexity that a particular experimental design implies for the subsequent computational analysis of the experimental data. The research objective of this ITR project is to bring together a team of investigators from MIT, Purdue and NYU-Courant along with their industrial collaborators to apply principles from information, coding and systems theory, along with advanced computational methods for statistical inference and numerical optimization, to create a unified approach to planning and analysis of complex quantitative experiments in the biological sciences, such as the determination of gene expression using gene chips and the determination of 3-D viral structure from scattering and electron microscopy experiments.

The goal is to design methods that make it easier to write software where data can be declared and checked to be private.","title":"ITR\/Language-Based Software Security","awardID":"0326577","effectiveDate":"2003-10-01","expirationDate":"2009-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["550026","507674",226709,"451874","556819"],"PO":["362818"]},"86306":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>0324844<br\/>Susan Wiedenbeck<br\/>Drexel University<br\/><br\/>There has been considerable work in empowering end users to be able to write their own programs, and as a result, users are indeed doing so. In fact, the number of end-user programmers in the United States is expected to reach 55 million by 2005, as compared to only 2.75 million professional programmers. The programming systems used by these end users include spreadsheet systems, web authoring tools, and graphical languages for demonstrating the desired behavior of educational simulations. Using such systems, end users create software, in forms such as educational simulations, spreadsheets, and dynamic e-business web applications. Unfortunately, however, errors are pervasive in end-user software, and the resulting impact is sometimes enormous. When the software end users create is not dependable, there can be serious consequences for the people whose retirement funds, credit histories, e-business revenues, and even health and safety rely on decisions made based on that software.<br\/>To address this problem, we propose a fundamental paradigm shift to a new way of thinking about the way end users create software. Our intent is to address the following research question:<br\/>Is it possible to bring the bene.ts of rigorous software engineering methodologies to end users?<br\/>We do not propose to transform end users into engineers. Rather, our plan is to enable systems to create software to collaborate with those users, in a software development paradigm that combines traditionally separate functions - blending speci.cation, design, implementation, component integration, debugging, testing, and maintenance into tightly integrated, highly interactive environments. These environments will employ new, incremental, feedback devices supported by analysis and inferential reasoning to help the user reason about the dependability of their software as they work with it, in a manner that respects the user's problem-solving directions to an extent unprecedented in existing software development environments.","title":"ITR: Collaborative Research: Dependable End-User Software","awardID":"0324844","effectiveDate":"2003-10-15","expirationDate":"2009-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}}],"PIcoPI":["503162"],"PO":["564388"]},"87538":{"abstract":"A national glass fiber network to serve 100 million households with two-way<br\/>symmetric data communications service at 100 Mb\/sec per household will<br\/>inevitably be constructed during the next few years.

Moreover, the devices used in such infrastructures<br\/>will vary widely, from sensors and embedded devices, to handhelds, to high end<br\/>server systems, all of which interact continuously in order to collect,<br\/>collate, and deliver information from where it is produced to where it is<br\/>needed. This project addresses the dynamic nature of distributed embedded<br\/>systems, by developing new information technologies that integrate across<br\/>multiple areas of Computer Science, including computer architecture, operating<br\/>and real-time systems, compilers, and middleware. The key intent is to create<br\/>morphable embedded services, that is, services that continuously self-modify<br\/>and adapt in order to meet dynamic application needs and environmental\/resource<br\/>constraints, including power budgets, end-to-end quality of service (QoS) guarantees<br\/>(e.g., timing constraints), and security constraints.<br\/><br\/>There are many Useful examples of morphable services. In limited forms, they<br\/>are already present in today's cellphone platforms, for instance, where end users<br\/>dynamically download new rings or acquire new games (possibly displacing existing<br\/>ones), etc. Service morphing, however, goes much beyond such configuration<br\/>capabilities. Imagine a cellphone, for example, which dynamically morphs into<br\/>an portable wand, using its sensing (e.g., its built-in camera) and<br\/>communication abilities (e.g., by interacting with other nearby phones)<br\/>to guide its owner out of a disaster site. Then, in contrast to such<br\/>functionality-centric morphing, consider this cellphone drawing on the<br\/>power of nearby server systems (or other phones) to provide suitable levels<br\/>of service to its user, despite the fact that its power is running low. This<br\/>can be done, for instance, by dynamically offloading services onto other<br\/>platforms, by (re)partitioning services across the device and cooperating server<br\/>systems, and\/or by deploying more power-efficient and perhaps, less graphics-capable<br\/>service code to the phone itself. Another interesting aspect of our work is its<br\/>ability to go beyond performance and power as the only critical elements of future<br\/>systems. With our approach, for instance, compiler methods and middleware can be used<br\/>to enhance information security rather than system performance. This can be done<br\/>by scattering critical application state to reduce its exposure to<br\/>external intrusions. As a result, information security can become an integral<br\/>element of the QoS needs of applications.<br\/><br\/>A concrete example of security-focused service morphing is to `scatter'<br\/>critical and vulnerable values across multiple cooperating distributed<br\/>platforms and to `assemble' them only to the extent needed by the application<br\/>under compiler control. Moreover, when the last use of the `assembled'<br\/>value is complete, the `assembled' value is destroyed. Each use of an `assembled' value is verified by compiler-generated code that authenticates it. For example, consider the use of last four digits of the social security number<br\/>used for authenticating a transaction. The entire social security number will<br\/>never be stored in a memory location as a value (that could be hacked into).<br\/>The value will be scattered in a form known only to the compiler which it will<br\/>then use to `assemble' the value just in time only for the extent of the use.<br\/><br\/>The different service morphing techniques to be developed in this research<br\/>include dynamic component (re)deployment, (re)specialization, and (re)partitioning.<br\/>Such actions are supported by system-level mechanisms that efficiently carry the<br\/>performance, usage, and requirements information needed for runtime component morphing,<br\/>principally addressing components' processing and communication actions.<br\/>The intent is for self-modifying components to be able to acquire runtime<br\/>information about current resource availabilities and Quality of Service<br\/>demands.

Recent advances in the understanding of<br\/>network protocols (specifically TCP friendliness and robust congestion signaling with ECN nonces), understanding of the sharing and termination issues in safe-language runtimes, and maturing language technology (in the form of Cyclone, a safe yet C-like language)-plus a well-defined problem domain that simplifies protection issues-have made the effective use of untrusted mobile code a real, though challenging, possi-bility.

The ease of experimenting with new<br\/>transport protocols in a realistic setting will lower the research barrier, helping a larger pool of researchers (and particularly minority institutions) to compete more on the basis of their ideas and less on the level of deployment resources they are able to muster. The researchers expect there to be a strong educational component of this work, since students as well as researchers can safely experiment without concern for adversely impacting the network, even on generic, shared machines. Real deployment, perhaps solving real problems, can occur among fellow students, and is ultimately limited only by a protocol's value and the students' ability to publicize it. Thus will students, and researchers, be empowered and motivated.","title":"SP: Collaborative Research: Rapid Evolution of Transport Protocols","awardID":"0338837","effectiveDate":"2003-10-01","expirationDate":"2007-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["543394"],"PO":["7594"]},"86538":{"abstract":"The goal of this project is to research and develop a prototype,<br\/>technology-rich infrastructure to support economical continuous monitoring<br\/>of cattle state of health via remote and wearable devices that interact<br\/>with a veterinary health information network.

In fact, the number of end-user programmers in the United States is expected to reach 55 million by 2005, as compared to only 2.75 million professional programmers. The programming systems used by these end users include spreadsheet systems, web authoring tools, and graphical languages for demonstrating the desired behavior of educational simulations. Using such systems, end users create software, in forms such as educational simulations, spreadsheets, and dynamic e-business web applications. Unfortunately, however, errors are pervasive in end-user software, and the resulting impact is sometimes enormous. When the software end users create is not dependable, there can be serious consequences for the people whose retirement funds, credit histories, e-business revenues, and even health and safety rely on decisions made based on that software.<br\/>To address this problem, we propose a fundamental paradigm shift to a new way of thinking about the way end users create software. Our intent is to address the following research question:<br\/>Is it possible to bring the bene.ts of rigorous software engineering methodologies to end users?<br\/>We do not propose to transform end users into engineers. Rather, our plan is to enable systems to create software to collaborate with those users, in a software development paradigm that combines traditionally separate functions - blending speci.cation, design, implementation, component integration, debugging, testing, and maintenance into tightly integrated, highly interactive environments. These environments will employ new, incremental, feedback devices supported by analysis and inferential reasoning to help the user reason about the dependability of their software as they work with it, in a manner that respects the user's problem-solving directions to an extent unprecedented in existing software development environments.","title":"ITR: Collaborative Research: Dependable End-User Software","awardID":"0405612","effectiveDate":"2003-10-15","expirationDate":"2009-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7352","name":"COMPUTING PROCESSES & ARTIFACT"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"9199","name":"UNDISTRIBUTED PANEL\/IPA FUNDS"}}],"PIcoPI":["549540"],"PO":["564388"]},"86506":{"abstract":"There is a host of existing and newly-emerging applications that require sophisticated and timely processing of fast, high-volume data streams.

The developer identifies the basic safety properties, then designs software interlocks that monitor the system to detect impending violations of these properties. When an impending violation is detected, the interlock takes actions designed to ensure that the property is not violated. For example, a safety property for a radiation therapy machine might state that treatment should stop within one second after an operator presses the emergency stop button. To enforce this property, an interlock might be added whose sole responsibility is to monitor the actions of the main control software and insert a beam stop if this control software fails to do so within the specified time. Key challenges include: monitoring technology to detect impending violations of safety properties; analyses of monitor results to detect inconsistent states, potentially unsafe actions, or the absence of required actions; and identification of appropriate interventions that may modify the internal state of the system to restore it to consistency, filter out inappropriate actions, or insert actions required to ensure that the system executes safely.","title":"ITR: Software Safety Mechanisms for Medical Systems","awardID":"0325283","effectiveDate":"2003-10-15","expirationDate":"2009-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["335202","497068","501796"],"PO":["551712"]},"87518":{"abstract":"Increasing use of computers and networks in business, government,<br\/>recreation, and almost all aspects of daily life has led to a<br\/>proliferation of sensitive data (i.e., data that, if used improperly,<br\/>can harm data subjects or other relevant parties), and concern about<br\/>the ownership, control, privacy, and accuracy of these data has become<br\/>a top priority.

One key element of quality of service is traffic management. Since the network traffic is bursty, it is difficult to make any QoS guarantees without proper control of traffic. Currently, Internet Protocol (IP) has only minimal traffic management capabilities. The packets are dropped when the queue exceeds the buffer capacity. The transmission control protocol (TCP) uses the packet drop as a signal of congestion and reduces its load. While in the past, this strategy has worked satisfactorily, there is need for better strategies for two reasons. First, a large part of the traffic, particularly, voice and video traffic does not use TCP. Continuous media traffic uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The proportion of UDP traffic is increasing at a faster pace than TCP traffic. The UDP traffic is congestion insensitive in the sense that UDP sources do not reduce their load in response to congestion. Second, the bandwidth of the networks as well as the distances are increasing. For very high distance-bandwidth product networks, packet drop is not the optimal congestion indication. Several megabytes of data may be lost in the time required to detect and respond to packet losses. Therefore, a better strategy for traffic management in IP networks is required.<br\/><br\/>Recognizing the need for direct feedback of congestion information, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has come up with an Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) method for IP routers. A bit in the IP header is set when the routers are congested. ECN is much more powerful than the simple packet drop indication used by existing routers and is suitable for high distance-bandwidth networks. Unfortunately, to realize the full potential of ECN, several questions need to be answered.<br\/><br\/>In this research proposal, the PIs propose a comprehensive program of research on traffic management in IP networks. They propose to develop a new set of traffic management algorithms for IP networks based on Explicit Congestion Notification mechanism. A total of 18 different issues will be analyzed. The PIs have identified potential solutions and approaches for each of these issues. Specifically, they propose to work on a new congestion detection and buffer management scheme for routers, a mechanism for TCP to react to ECN messages from the network. One of the important goals of this research is to make TCP traffic management algorithm free of any bias based on round trip time and number of congested gateways traveled.<br\/><br\/>The proposed research will be based on theoretical analysis and simulations. The PI's approach will be a formal analysis of simple scenarios, heuristic analysis of more complex scenarios and validation using simulations. The emphasis will be to develop simple solutions. However, the performance lost in exchange of simplicity will be theoretically analyzed.<br\/><br\/>Traffic management is the key in providing QoS. Currently, a significant amount of NSF, DARPA, and other research funding as well as energy in networking is being spent on QoS issues. When QoS based solutions (integrated services, differentiated services, or multiprotocol label switching) are deployed, the need for traffic management will become apparent and the PIs expect to see an immediate need for proper methods for traffic management. This proposal is, therefore, timely and important.","title":"Traffic Management in IP Networks","awardID":"0413187","effectiveDate":"2003-10-01","expirationDate":"2005-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["532760"],"PO":["565090"]},"86519":{"abstract":"This project proposes the Scalable Non-stOP Server (SNOPS) architecture: a reliable, available, and serviceable (RAS) hardware platform.
