A new approach to software testing based on AI Planning is investigated. The similarity of plans to test cases for some systems (e.g., command language and transaction based systems) makes the representation well suited for test generation. The representation encourages testers to think at a higher level when designing tests. To exploit these potential advantages, an automated test generator is constructed with an AI planning system at its core. This generator allows representation of testing goals and testing criteria to support a variety of testing tasks. The project's contribution to Software Testing is to extend how testing goals are articulated. Its contribution to AI planning is developing new search strategies for efficient planning, and determining how to generate goals that conform to tester's intent, and evaluating the efficacy of using AI planners during software testing. Tasks include 1) improve planning efficiency for generating large tests; 2) include representation of test focus and various test criteria to make the approach flexible; 3) represent high level testing goals to reduce tedium for testers; 4) evaluate the efficacy of the new approach to identify strengths and weaknesses of using AI Planning for testing. ***","title":"Flexible Automated Software Test Generation Using AI Planning Technology","awardID":"9619787","effectiveDate":"1997-08-15","expirationDate":"2000-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"6856","name":"ARTIFICIAL INTELL & COGNIT SCI"}}],"PIcoPI":["554621","424402"],"PO":["150697"]},"22090":{"abstract":"9708913 Complex, evolved software is constructed from a tight-knit composition of computational structures, called strands, each of which is responsible for achieving some requirement, goal, or subset of system functionality.

This phenomenon is called interleaving, and understanding how interleaved strands compose is the purpose of the proposed work. There are two key objectives to the research: to formulate a rigorous characterization of the compositional relationships among interleaved strands and to design a new representation for expressing their composition. To form a rigorous characterization, a case study of an existing corpus of software will be performed in which interleaving of design patterns will be investigated and compositional mechanisms will be classified. Existing formalisms for representing strands and their relationships will be surveyed and extended to create a new formalism that expresses strand composition. The understanding gained will suggest what types of documentation, programming language features, and design abstractions are needed to enable software engineers to make interleaving decisions explicit. This will alert future maintainers of interleaved software to the fact that the interleaving was intentionally introduced and mitigate problems with understanding it. ***","title":"Software Evolution and Interleaving","awardID":"9708913","effectiveDate":"1997-08-01","expirationDate":"1999-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"Y171","name":"DARPA-SOFTWARE EVOL & INTERLEA"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"Y639","name":"DARPA-SOFTWARE EVOLUTION & INT"}}],"PIcoPI":["393313","397849"],"PO":["150697"]},"22091":{"abstract":"9708915 This research focuses on applying formal methods to the problem of certification of imported software.

In this method, the physical nature of the flat fading signal is exploited to yield a deterministic model that predicts the channel for an entire block of data. Specifically, the mobile radio signal is decomposed into several scattered components distinguished by their Doppler shifts; the slowly varying parameters associated with these components are determined and tracked, and the composite fading signal is predicted.

This could be on a different machine, or for a parallel program, a different parallel processing environment. The PI is attacking AIC from different angles.

The research here involves the development of a new concept in the design of this analog circuitry that allows very low voltage operation of high frequency circuits.

This comes at a cost -- the computations are sometimes very slow and\/or memory intensive; at times, the correct results of a computation are too huge to be of use. Numerical computation, on the other hand, is faster, and, on well conditioned input problem instances, one can expect correct solutions in the sense of backward error analysis. The numerical approach has been very successful in solving a wide spectrum of computational problems in science and engineering. However, there are situations where this approach is not completely satisfactory. In several applications of polynomial system solving arising in areas such as geometric modeling and kinematics, one needs the exact answer to a given problem instance and not to a near-by instance. On the flip side, in many application problems, the input polynomial system is not known exactly but to within small error bounds. This changes the nature of questions that can be asked of a solver. For instance, a question such as ``does a given system of polynomial equations have a root of multiplicity r?'' changes to ``is the given system of polynomial equations near a system that has a root of multiplicity r?'' with respect to some appropriate measure of nearness. Existing symbolic\/numeric algorithms are not equipped to handle such questions well. Some of the issues that need to be addressed in this framework are: characterization of the solutions to a system of polynomial equations\/inequalities in the presence of small input errors; design of efficient algorithms for solving polynomial systems that work in limited (or adaptive) precision; understanding the factors that affect the stability of these algorithms; investigation of ways to arrange the sometimes independent symbolic phase and numerical phase in polynomial system solving to take maximum advantage of the strengths of each other. This project investigates some specific instance s of polynomial system solving in the above framework with particular focus on approximate polynomial greatest common divisors and several special families of systems of polynomials. A new parametric minimization technique is being studied and applied to the approximate GCD problem and several of its variants. The concept of generic Groebner bases is introduced and in combination with eigenvalue computations, their effectiveness in the approximate solving of certain special families of polynomial systems is being investigated. The investigation of generic Groebner bases throws fresh light on some well-known unresolved issues in Groebner base theory.

To date, these methods have been primarily used in domains like VLSI and protocol verification, i.e., problems which possess an inherent finite-state structure. Model-checking has proved less useful for analyzing general, concurrent programs realized in software, where many basic properties are undecidable. The PIs are developing algorithms to help attack this problem, by combining a variety of techniques used in model-checking, program analysis, constraint-solving and graph theory. The resulting methods guarantee convergence by allowing false negatives; often, these conservative approximations are sufficient to prove the properties under investigation. To date, the tools developed in the project have automatically verified some classical infinite-state programs. Examples are (1) the well known Bakery Algorithm which handles fair mutual-exclusion between multiple processes; and (2) FIFO queuing via circular, N-place buffers, where N is not bounded a priori. The analysis tools proved relevant safety and liveness properties in a matter of seconds; the same properties usually take several hours for advanced students to prove by hand. The PIs are now developing strategies for scaling these results. Methods under investigation are (1) finding more precise approximation techniques, specifically for abstracting path relations as transitive closures of infinite programs; (2) developing compositional strategies to help conquer state-explosion due to concurrency; and (3) unifying the automatic tools with a \"proof shell,\" to let the user combine automatic verification results into a higher-level, global proof structure. ***","title":"Constraint-Based Analysis of Infinite-State Programs","awardID":"9619808","effectiveDate":"1997-08-15","expirationDate":"2000-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}}],"PIcoPI":["152351","78173"],"PO":["150697"]},"19312":{"abstract":"This project focuses on three problem areas concerning linear constraint query languages.

Linear constraint databases are generally represented by quantifier-free logical formulas over some arithmetical domain such as the real numbers (the real closed field) with addition. Conceptually, constraint queries are evaluated in closed form using quantifier elimination algorithms. The first part of this project aims at developing efficient query evaluation algorithms for linear or dense order constraint queries and syntactic forms for representing constraint databases so that efficient query evaluation becomes possible. The second part aims at showing the complexity of properties of constraint query languages including query containment, equivalence, satisfiability, and disjointness using a new technique based on abstract machines. The third part aims at developing incremental evaluation techniques for recursive (non-first-order) and topological queries.

For the communications application, this study demonstrates that such adaptive signal processing can effectively mitigate interference in satellite and terrestrial CDMA spread spectrum wireless communications as well as provide cross-talk cancellation in dense WDM fiberoptic links. The benefits of this new technology include power savings and increased data throughput, leading to newer generations of receiver processing hardware that are being developed from this study. In the sensor array processing application, it is demonstrated that low-complexity, reduced-dimension adaptive CFAR detectors are capable of outperforming all existing detectors for modern radar systems. The technology developed from this research permits space-time adaptive processing on platforms which are limited in terms of size, weight and power; such as airborne and space-segment surveillance systems. The key underlying innovation in all of these applications is the use of transform domain adaptive signal processing utilizing the cross-spectral metric and low-complexity filtering structures. This metric permits a lower-order adaptive filter to converge to a solution which is either identical or very close to the optimal solution. Since this filter has a smaller number of adaptive weights, it converges faster and requires a lower computational complexity. This new technology represents a generalization of multiresolution and time-frequency basis representations. The full-dimensional transform domain representation (realized using a filterbank, DFT\/DCT, or wavelet) is then compressed to keep only the most important information as selected by the cross-spectral metric.","title":"Reduced-Rank Adaptive Filtering for Spread Spectrum Communications, Array Processing and Detection","awardID":"9706215","effectiveDate":"1997-08-15","expirationDate":"2000-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["134414","279768"],"PO":["564898"]},"23174":{"abstract":"This project will investigate algorithmic solutions to several geometric problems arising in layered manufacturing, where a physical prototype of a 3D object is built directly from its computer model by orienting and slicing the model into parallel layers and manufacturing the layers successively.

This approach has the following advantages: First, distributing the search process makes more equitable use of computing and network resources and allows search agents to be customized to reflect local interests and preferences. Second, an ontology-based browsing agent allows for more serendipitous access to Web resources. Unlike the current browsing structures (e.g., Yahoo), these browsing agents associate appropriate resources with each concept automatically. The ontology may adapt over time at individual sites, allowing the browsing structure to evolve as the Web itself evolves. Third, the ability to visualize large portions of the Web in a more abstract way allows users to quickly get an impression of what type of information is available. Fourth, by keeping a history of changes to the local ontologies, the ebb and flow of the importance of concepts locally and globally can be presented. Finally, undergraduate and graduate students are being exposed to a truly interdisciplinary research through their involvement in a long term project that combines expertise from several fields, primarily computer graphics, artificial intelligence, distributed processing and information science.

Optimizing compilers have long motivated research in this area, commonly known as static program analysis. More recently, there has been interest in using program analysis to verify correctness or safety properties of software before it is put into service. However, due both to the phenomenon of accumulated imprecision, which is akin to accumulated rounding error, and to the inadequacy of invariant properties in the presence of loops and recursion, useful and accurate program analysis is hard to achieve in practice. This project examines a new methodology for program analysis designed to address these problems. This methodology is distinctive in that it does not analyze execution states, but instead analyzes the changes, called transfer relations, between those states, thus enabling previously unsolved analyses of programming constructs such as first-class functions, concurrency, pointers and references, assignment, mutable data structures, and arrays. The research investigates the application of these analyses to urgent issues such as ensuring safety of untrusted foreign code and increasing reliability of large software systems.

This multipath propagation causes each pulse to be corrupted by pulses transmitted before and after it; the deleterious effects of this \"intersymbol interference\" (ISI) necessitate signal processing in the form of an \"equalizer\". As a further complications, the projected explosion in the number of cellular users will almost certainly require two users in the same of adjacent cells to occupy the same frequency band. This leads to \"co-channel interference\" that manifests itself as cross-talk amongst users. The use of antenna arrays, which enables discrimination amongst signals arriving from different directions, offers a means of suppressing co-channel interference. This research focuses on the development of spatiotemporal signal processing schemes to effect both equalization and interference cancellation for mobile narrowband digital communications in an urban cellular environment. The equalizer design problem is reformulated as a convex optimization problem based on linear matrix inequalities and solved numerically. Equalization is effected with sample-spaced taps at each antenna, encompassing a time duration roughly equal to the multipath time delay spread. This facilitates better tracking of time-varying multipath channels as compared to conventional equalization schemes employing symbol-spaced taps. Interference cancellation is effected by forming beams with directions of maximum gain steered towards the desired user's multipath, and nulls steered towards strong co-channel interferers. This is achieved by processing a short training signal via a novel extended correlator that highly localizes in time the contribution of the desired user's signal, thereby allowing one to estimate the spatial correlation matrix of the interferers. The equalization an d interference cancellation schemes developed in this research hold the greatest promise in terms of the trade-off amongst convergence rate, computational complexity, robustness to model mismatch, and symbol error performance for Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems where the multipath time delay spread is less than the null-to-null mainlobe of the pulse symbol waveform, as is the case with cellular systems based on the IS-136 TDMA standard.","title":"Space-Time Processing for Digital Comm: Nonparametric Channel ID & Interference Cancellation & Multichannel Equalizer Design Based on Linear Matrix Inequalities","awardID":"9708309","effectiveDate":"1997-08-01","expirationDate":"2001-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["434205","332293"],"PO":["564898"]},"20472":{"abstract":"This project plans to investigate how to best use multiple workstations to support modern, highly interactive applications.

Tomographic imaging techniques allow noninvasive\/nondestructive studies which minimize patient trauma and cost in the medical domain, and reduce manufacturing and maintenance expenses for many industries by transforming external measurements into images of the interior of the patient or object. The established methods for computing tomographic images in common examples such as x-ray CT scanning are inadequate for difficult cases involving a shortage of data or great uncertainty in their precise values due to inherent error in measurements. For these problems, algorithms are needed which explicitly take into account the characteristics of the measurement errors as well as common behavior of the tissue or materials under study. Much improvement has resulted from statistical methods such as Bayesian tomographic estimation, but conventional estimation techniques, based on homogeneous random field models and fixed optimization strategies, seem to be approaching their limits of improvement. This project is developing three principal innovations to improve the capabilities of tomographic systems, with particular focus on three-dimensional applications: (1) nonhomogeneous image cross section models which allow spatially varying image characteristics to be accurately estimated using a simple multiscale estimation procedure; (2) fast nonlinear optimization algorithms for minimizing the nonquadratic functions that result from MAP estimation with nonGaussian prior models; (3) a novel approach to tomographic reconstruction based on nonlinear, non-iterative estimation from back projection data.

Traditional on-line problems abstract away the existence of multiple threads, either by collapsing multiple threads into a single thread or by reducing each thread to a single request. This project studies a new class of problems: on-line systems with multi-threaded inputs. To model multi-threaded inputs, multiple client input model where each client (thread) is represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) are introduced. Three practical problems investigated are the multi-threaded paging problem, where processes compete for both central processing unit (CPU) time and fast memory locations; the multi-threaded disk scheduling problem where processes and\/or database transactions compete for access to the disk; and the multi-threaded operating system problem, the natural combination of these two problems. These problems generalize into the k-client problem, a dual version of the well-studied k-server problem, and the k-server l-client problem. One important goal of this research is to learn how to design a complex system such as a fast memory manager, a CPU scheduler, and a disk scheduler. In particular, determine if the algorithms and results obtained by considering each system component in isolation can be easily combined to produce new algorithms and results for the complete system. In education, there are two complementary projects. The first project deals with the process of learning how to teach. The PI applied for and received a highly competitive MSU Lilly Endowment Teaching Fellowship. In this intensive year-long program, the PI will work together with a group of five promising young faculty to learn fundamental educational principles taught by leading education scholars from around the University and around the country. The second project is to build a more cohesive curriculum emphasizing the practical importance of all topics, especially theory. This is achieved by leading a departmental effort to wr ite a comprehensive computer science textbook written in hypertext markup language (HTML). This HTML textbook will utilize hyperlinks to highlight the connections between and within courses. For example, links will connect a module on stacks and queues from a data structures course with modules from an operating systems course where these structures are used.

University of Massachusetts A Facility for Cross Disciplinary Research on Sensorimotor Development in Humans and Machines This award is for supporting research activities in Computer Science and Psychology at UMass in assembling an infrastructure for experimental work on the development of conceptual structure from sensorimotor activity. An interactionist theory is advanced in which the origin of knowledge is interactive behavior in an environment. By this account, the nature of the environment and the agent's native resources (sensors, effectors, and control) lead directly to appropriate conceptual structures in natural and artificial systems. The central claim of this research is that the first task facing an intelligent, embodied agent is coordinated sensory and motor interaction with its environment and that this task leads to policies and abstractions that influence the subsequent acquisition of higher cognitive abilities. An interdisciplinary team specializing in robotics, cognitive development, and motor development, learning, planning and language lead the effort.

In addition to the robotics facilities, the infrastructure includes tools for gathering precise, quantitative observations of postures and rates of movement in human subjects.

The investigators will build a corpus of cases, strategies, and analyses from three general sources: (1) the case examples and exercises taken from leading textbooks in engineering ethics (2) the knowledge, reasoning skills and case examples provided by engineering ethicists and professional engineers as revealed in protocols which the investigators will acquire and analyze, and (3) the findings of the investigators' previous empirical study of different strategies for analyzing practical ethical dilemmas employed by novice and more experienced ethical reasoners. As a result of that study, the investigators found that experienced ethical reasoners are careful to identify issues and to specify conditions under which specific professional role obligations recommend particular actions, that they elaborate conditions which would affect the moral analysis of a problem, in part through posing hypothetical variations of the problem, and that they justify resolutions in terms of those conditions which they conclude apply in the problem. The investigators will develop techniques for using the corpus to challenge and instruct novices in a manual tutoring intervention and assess the pedagogical value of those techniques. They will present an experimental group of novices aspects of the experienced analyses and invite them to compare those conclusions with their own reasoning. The goal will be to assess how novices understand the use of hypothetical variations and their moral significance for the analysis of the problem. A control group will not be exposed to the experts' reasoning and conclusions, and their conclusions will be compared with the experimental analysis of the same problems. The experimental design will also allow investigators to contrast the protocols of novices analyzing problems from the corpus and compare them to the experienced or expert analyses of the same problems. Results will be reported in journals and at meetings and can form the basis for developing a computational model and designing an interactive tutoring system. The significance lies in the development of a better understanding of a pedagogical strategy widely used in practical ethical instruction. The study will shed light on how experts' analyses comparing problems to variations can assist students in learning the process of ethical reasoning.","title":"Collaborative Research: Practical Ethical Instruction with Expert-Analyzed Cases","awardID":"9617071","effectiveDate":"1997-08-01","expirationDate":"2000-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0405","name":"Division of OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE","abbr":"SES"},"pgm":{"id":"7915","name":"Ethics & Values of SET"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1109","name":"Division of RESEARCH ON LEARNING","abbr":"DRL"},"pgm":{"id":"7256","name":"RSCH IN EDUCATION, POLICY, PRA"}}],"PIcoPI":["488662"],"PO":["288903"]},"25238":{"abstract":"This award will enable Old Colorado City Communications (OCCC) and the Institute of Applied Space Research (IASR) of George Washington University (GWU) to hold a workshop highlighting the promise of terrestrial wireless and next generation communication satellite technology for the research and education (R&E) community.

Particular attention is paid to the global post-critical behavior of symmetric imperfection-free elastic shell structures --- the analysis of which has great significance in understanding the large deformation response and ultimate collapse scenario of realistic engineering structures. A major theme of the work is to exploit the natural parallelism, via group theoretic techniques, in an important class of engineering problems characterized by underlying symmetries. They also investigate the use of automatic differentiation software in the context of those problems. Finally, they study the effectiveness of symmetry-motivated preconditioners, within the context of Krylov iterative subspace methods, for a class of ``almost-symmetric'' problems in structural mechanics. Due to their high strength-to-weight ratios, thin shell structures have been used extensively in aerospace, civil, mechanical and nuclear engineering applications, e.g., dome roofs, aerospace vehicles, pressure vessels, containment vessels, etc. Yet the ability of engineers to predict the ultimate failure of such systems has heretofore been more of an art than a science (relying heavily upon costly experimental verification -- see \"Computerized Buckling Analysis of Shells\", by D. Bushnell, Martinus Nijhoff 1985). The investigators combine new mathematical ideas of symmeytry and nonlinear analysis with high-performance computing methodology to analyze such systems efficiently and systematically. A long-term goal is to provide engineers with useful tools for the sytematic analysis (and ultimately better design) for this important class of structures.

While testing has historically concentrated on the implementation as the target of inquiry, this research instead considers the architectural specification of the system as the target. There are five major contributions to software architecture and software testing technology arising from this research. First, a set of architecture-based integration test criteria are defined to provide requirements for testing architectural aspects of a system; methods are also developed for applying these criteria to architectural styles and domain- specific architectures. Second, methods are developed for testing an implementation in terms of its conformance to a specified architecture via architecture conformance oracles. Third, architecture-level slicing techniques are defined for localizing architectural defects and minimizing regression testing. Fourth, methods are developed for using feature tests to discover the architecture of a system from its implementation.

Current approaches to analog processing are running up against fundamental limitations. Log-domain filtering is a relatively new approach that offers wide dynamic range and excellent high-frequency response using simple, low-voltage circuits. Log-domain filters exploit the translinear current-voltage characteristics of bipolar transistors or weak-inversion MOSFETS to achieve overall linearity. The basic signal processing elements can be quite simple in form and their high-frequency performance can be excellent while distortion can be low because most of the transistor non-linearities are cancelled within the circuit. This research has three major thrusts: The first thrust is toward fundamental, design-oriented analysis of log-domain circuits. Design methodologies and fundamental understanding of the limitations of log-domain filters are in an early stage. Fundamental analyses allow development of figures of merit for evaluating and comparing log-domain circuits. The second thrust focuses on developing new log-domain circuit topologies. Based on an understanding of fundamental limitations, new circuits are being designed to improve performance. The third thrust is toward applications of log-domain circuits. Integrated circuits are being built and tested to demonstrate the usefulness of log-domain circuits in practical applications. Initial focus is on two application areas: low-voltage wireless communications, to exploit the performance potential of log- domain circuits and adaptive and biologically inspired circuits, to build on their fundamental simplicity.","title":"Design-Oriented Analysis and Practical Applications of Log-Domain Filtering","awardID":"9706558","effectiveDate":"1997-08-01","expirationDate":"2001-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4710","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["456658","104340"],"PO":["564898"]},"38703":{"abstract":"","title":"Distributed Manipulation Algorithms for Massively Parallel Microfabricated Actuator Arrays","awardID":"9896020","effectiveDate":"1997-08-01","expirationDate":"2000-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["213293","244163"],"PO":["475621"]},"21863":{"abstract":"9708643 The goal of this research is to devise and perform component integration experiments at the software architectural level that determine (1) what component interoperability problems exist, (2) what are solutions to those problems, and (3) which strategies for integration can perform those solutions. The value of this research is that it can provide developers with early knowledge of potential interoperability problems among software components. With this knowledge, developers can treat integration as a design decision, instead of only an implementation task. With the increased use of COTS applications, developers can choose between applications with similar functionality but fewer interoperability problems with in-house components, speeding productivity. Using research on software architecture, design patterns, and reports on integrating actual applications, the proposed research will define a catalog of architectural characteristics of software that contribute to interoperability problems. Integration strategies will be associated with their respective solutions to the conflicts that result from interleaving component characteristics. A knowledge based system will serve as an experimental testbed to determine the best integration strategy based on predefined conflict resolutions among characteristics. The research results, i.e., characteristics, conflicts, solutions, and strategies, will be provided to the developer to enhance design decisions and to formulate implementations. ***","title":"Experimentation Platform for Detecting and Resolving Interoperability Problems","awardID":"9708643","effectiveDate":"1997-08-01","expirationDate":"1998-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}}],"PIcoPI":["362926"],"PO":["150697"]},"20785":{"abstract":"9705410 Bodenschatz This is a renewal project, the aim of which is the experimental and numerical investigation of non-linear, non-equilibrium pattern- forming phenomena in extended dynamical systems.

The approach is based on financial option pricing theory. This research will extend this theory to model contracts that have no analogs in financial options, such as contract quality guarantees and multiple sequential subcontracting. To evaluate the research, a multi-agent simulation testbed will be developed and utilized to conduct empirical studies that can answer significant theoretical questions. Questions to be studied for evaluation include the effects on the overall multi-agent society of different model assumptions such as stationary vs. non-stationary stochastic processes for modeling environmental uncertainty, different contracting strategies, and examinations of the value of information especially for asymmetrical information scenarios. Real world domains of theoretical and practical significance such as supply contracting and electronic commerce will be used to provide realistic problem scenarios.

Since digitally encoded signals can be processed with virtually arbitrary precision, continued progress in the scaling of integrated circuit technology is accomplished by corresponding demand to improve the precision and speed of so-called data conversion interfaces. This pressure is, in turn, accompanied by two constraining factors: the desire to embed data conversion interfaces within large digital signal processing circuits and explosive growth in the demand for portable electronic systems. The integration of data conversion circuits in VLSI technologies imposes severe constraints on the dynamic range available to implement those circuits, while the concern for battery life in portable systems often dictates substantial reductions in power dissipation in comparison to traditional applications. The principal objective of this research is to discover circuit design techniques for digitizing signals with bandwidths of several MHz using standard digital CMOS technologies. The research focuses on the use of oversampling methods to encode MHz-bandwidth radio signals centered at IF frequencies in the range of a few tens of MHz and on methods of increasing the resolution of Nyquist-rate converters for digitizing baseband signals with bandwidths on the order of 10 MHz. A complementary theme of the research is operation from a low supply voltage with minimum power dissipation.","title":"High-Resolution, Broadband VLSI Data Conversion Interfaces","awardID":"9710647","effectiveDate":"1997-08-01","expirationDate":"2000-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["213464"],"PO":["564898"]},"38717":{"abstract":"","title":"Sian Ka'an 97 Second Joint Mexico-US International Workshop on Neural Networks and Neurocontrol, August 19-29, 1997, Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo, Mexico","awardID":"9896036","effectiveDate":"1997-08-15","expirationDate":"1998-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0701","name":"Division of ELECTRICAL, COMMUN & CYBER SYS","abbr":"ECCS"},"pgm":{"id":"1518","name":"CONTROL, NETWORKS, & COMP INTE"}}],"PIcoPI":[98338],"PO":["563109"]},"22855":{"abstract":"Viruses have shells made of repeated protein subunits surrounding their genetic information.

First, a set of architecture-based integration test criteria are defined to provide requirements for testing architectural aspects of a system; methods are also developed for applying these criteria to architectural styles and domain-specific architectures. Second, methods are developed for testing an implementation in terms of its conformance to a specified architecture via architecture conformance oracles. Third, architecture-level slicing techniques are defined for localizing architectural defects and minimizing regression testing.

Compliant devices replace elements traditionally assembled using joints and springs with compliant flexible members that use elastic deformations to transmit motions and forces. This allows the research to concentrate more on representation, translation, and interface issues of design and fabrication, and less on issues such as assemble and manufacturability. The domain of compliant mechanisms allows design and optimization to be performed on devices at both the macro and micro level (e.g., SFF and MEMS-type fabrication processes, respectively), and so will afford a unique opportunity to study the clean separation of design and fabrication analogous to the VLSI paradigm. This research targets three primary areas of compliant mechanism design and fabrication. Fundamental to this study is the optimal synthesis of compliant devices, both macro and micro. This includes the design and analysis of 3-D structures and the nonlinearities associated with large deformations. The ability to form more complex objects based on a library of standardized parametric components will also be explored. As the processes are generally not the same, the issue of designing and refining translation tools to move between representations is a critical component in this research. The choice of intermediate representations will be critically examined, and the appropriate translation tools will be developed. The goal here will be to push towards intermediate formats that are suitable to multiple fabrication processes, at both the micro and macro scales. Finally, the ability to test and refine designs for micro structures by the use of macro prototypes fabricated from the same initial model will be developed, and its utility in the design of MEMS devices will be carefully examined.","title":"Design and Rapid Prototyping of Customized Micro and Macro Compliant Mechanisms","awardID":"9617997","effectiveDate":"1997-08-01","expirationDate":"2001-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4710","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["563532","553286","554983","252838"],"PO":["564898"]},"24429":{"abstract":"This proposal requests support for the third annual German-American Frontiers of Science Symposium (GAFOS) to be held in Munich, Germany, June 19-22, 1997.

As a result of that study, the investigators found that experienced ethical reasoners are careful to identify issues and to specify conditions under which specific professional role obligations recommend particular actions, that they elaborate conditions which would affect the moral analysis of a problem, in part through posing hypothetical variations of the problem, and that they justify resolutions in terms of those conditions which they conclude apply in the problem. The investigators will develop techniques for using the corpus to challenge and instruct novices in a manual tutoring intervention and assess the pedagogical value of those techniques. They will present an experimental group of novices aspects of the experienced analyses and invite them to compare those conclusions with their own reasoning. The goal will be to assess how novices understand the use of hypothetical variations and their moral significance for the analysis of the problem. A control group will not be exposed to the experts' reasoning and conclusions, and their conclusions will be compared with the experimental analysis of the same problems. The experimental design will also allow investigators to contrast the protocols of novices analyzing problems from the corpus and compare them to the experienced or expert analyses of the same problems. Results will be reported in journals and at meetings and can form the basis for developing a computational model and designing an interactive tutoring system. The significance lies in the development of a better understanding of a pedagogical strategy widely used in practical ethical instruction.

The algorithm studied include the existential theory of the reals, quantifier elimination over real closed fields and constructing roadmaps of arbitrary semi-algebraic sets. An important development comes from considering the situation in which these problems live on an algebraic variety of dimension lower than the dimension of the ambient space. In this situation it has been possible to find algorithms and structural bounds for which the combinatorial complexity depends on the dimension of the variety rather than on the dimension of the ambient space. These ideas will be used to: (1) Develop more efficient algorithms to compute a semi- algebraic description of the connected components of a semi- algebraic set. (2) Investigate the complexity of a Whitney stratification of a semi-algebraic set. (3) Develop more efficient algorithms to compute the real dimension of a semi-algebraic set. (4) Investigate other parameters of complexity such as the input fewnomial bound (the number of input monomials) and explore broadening the class of input functions to Pfaffian functions. (5) Remove the genericity hypotheses in the recent breakthrough result of Sharir, which gives nearly sharp bounds on the complexity of the lower envelope of a family of hypersurfaces (or patches of such surfaces) in general position. (6) Investigate whether the classical zone theorem can be further extended to bound the complexity of an algebraic variety in the midst of a family of algebraic sets. The solution of these problems would have significant impact on problems in motion planning and computer algebra.","title":"Combinatorial Algorithms in Real Algebraic Geometry","awardID":"9711240","effectiveDate":"1997-08-15","expirationDate":"2001-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":["381203"],"PO":["179846"]},"22639":{"abstract":"9710575 Software evolution is an important creative process, but it carries serious perils, particularly when the software is embedded in a critical enterprise and must evolve within its operational context.
