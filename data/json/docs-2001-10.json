Mixed-technology system development requires research on two fronts: The first is the component or the device level and the second is the integration of heterogeneous components at the system level. At the component or the device level, the research will focus on four building-blocks: Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), Biological Microelectromechanical Systems (Bio-MEMS), Nanoelectromechanical Systems (NEMS) and Biological ion channels integrated with nanoelectronics (nanobioelectronics). Efficient computational design tools integrated with experimental validation will be developed for each of these building blocks. At the system level the research focuses on integration of MEMS and Bio-MEMS with conventional electronics. <br\/>Device level modeling research will focus on development of new scattered point computational methods for fast, efficient and flexible analysis of micro and nanoscale devices, development of multiscale approaches combining continuum and molecular approaches, development of enhanced continuum models to capture microscopic phenomena, and development of efficient reduced-order modeling approaches for fast dynamic analysis. System level modeling research will focus on development of new algorithms and techniques to integrate various micro-device partial differential equations solvers with the circuit simulator (SPICE3) and development of efficient time stepping schemes with different numerical devices for simulation of the complete system. The experimental effort will focus on development of new fabrication approaches for realizing nanobioelectronics, NEMS and systems level integration of MEMS and Bio-MEMS with conventional electronics.","title":"ITR\/SY: Computational Design of Mixed-Technology Systems","awardID":"0121616","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2006-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["520677","529083","410638","468846","539633"],"PO":["325495"]},"63806":{"abstract":"CONACyT: Binational Collaborative Development of Spoken Language<br\/>Technology in Latin American Spanish<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>This is a standard award.

Soft segmentation produces flexible (e.g., fuzzy or probabilistic) labels for individual pixels in an image as opposed to forcing a decision about each pixel. Soft segmentation is an effective method for noisy images, such as intra-operative fluoroscopic x-ray images, where preservation of information is critical. In recent years, a variety of promising voxel-property or intensity-based matching algorithms have been developed for three-dimensional (3D) medical image registration, but these algorithms are inadequate in the presence of significant noise. Spine images contain rigid elements (vertebrae) within a deformable structure (spine). Registration is performed on a single vertebra, therefore, spine images contain both structured and unstructured noise. Research is proposed to apply soft labels to the segmentation of two-dimensional (2D) images of the spine for 2D\/3D image registration. The postdoctoral associate will assist in 1) adapting an existing fiducial-based clinical spinal navigation system to use image-based fine registration using pre-segmented images, 2) developing a semi-automated segmentation of fluoroscopic images growing a bounding-box around the region of interest, 3) developing both fuzzy and probabilistic 'soft' labels for segmenting the fluoroscopic images, and 4) the convolution of soft labels into gradient and mutual information-based intensity-based matching algorithms.","title":"Postdoc: Integrating Soft Segmentation With Intensity-Based Matching for 2D\/3D Image Data Registration","awardID":"0104114","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2003-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1713","name":"WORKFORCE"}}],"PIcoPI":[156744,156745,156746],"PO":["564318"]},"80824":{"abstract":"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant will investigate business-to-consumer (B2C) online auction mechanisms that are being engineered by online merchants.

Analysis will focus on technology use in the implementation of a formal neighborhood council system in the City of Los Angeles. This reform effort represents a significant and well-defined natural experiment in the political uses of information and communications technologies (ICTs). As such, it provides an opportunity to extend the technology and politics literature, which to date has focused on the national level and elections, to investigate effects on local governance, which is the primary sphere for civic engagement in policy making. The research will draw from theories in the area of political communication, organizational theory and urban political economy to develop hypotheses about the factors that influence the successful integration of ICTs in the creation of neighborhood council systems, their effects on patterns of political communication, and the effects of communications networks on political outcomes and attitudes among stakeholders at the local level. <br\/><br\/>The implementation of neighborhood councils in Los Angeles is currently in the planning process and will proceed beginning June 2001. The current plan calls for the creation of 100 to 200 advisory councils at the community level, and the implementation of an Internet-based early notification system intended to provide councils early input into city policy making processes. In addition, councils are required to create systems for communication with community stakeholders. The City in turn is mandated to provide councils with a communication system linking all neighborhood councils and training and material support for communications. This reform represents an unprecedented urban experiment with political communication, and is particularly important given the size, ethnic diversity, and global economic position of the City of Los Angeles. The research will employ multiple methods to elucidate the complex linkages between implementation inputs, communication networks, political processes, and policy and attitudinal outcomes. The methods employed will include (1) case study analysis of the design, implementation, and diffusion of neighborhood councils and communications technology; (2) analysis of the vertical communications promulgated and received by elected officials as a part of the mandated early notification system; (3) network analysis of the dynamics of communications within and between neighborhood councils and city government; and (4) preliminary analysis of the political effects of vertical and horizontal communications.<br\/><br\/>Data collection will include archival and field research, interviews, and two panel surveys. These data will be employed in diffusion analyses and network analyses producing sociograms of linkages and cliques developing among members of city government and neighborhood councils. The network analysis provides a systematic framework for conceptualizing and analyzing the effects of ICTs on communication patterns and the manner in which changing communication patterns influence democratic outcomes.<br\/>This analysis will illuminate the effects of ICTs on the distribution of information and political communications and the resulting effects of changing communication patterns on citizen participation and the responsiveness of political institutions. The research is expected to improve understanding of the technological factors that impede or promote political participation by traditionally underrepresented groups and provide a more detailed understanding of socio-economic and communicative characteristics of citizens impede them from taking advantage of technology-based reforms. This knowledge will help policy makers develop methods by which these differences may be bridged.","title":"ITR: Digital Government: Communications Technology and Urban Governance Reform","awardID":"0112899","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2004-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1706","name":"DIGITAL GOVERNMENT"}}],"PIcoPI":[161570,"214166",161572,"454789"],"PO":["371077"]},"61509":{"abstract":"The proposed research is about the use of optimal control theory and modern numerical linear algebra<br\/>techniques to improve existing power control schemes and to formulate and solve more general and more<br\/>realistic formulations of power control problem in 3-G wireless CDMA networks. The first two parts of the<br\/>proposal deal with the deterministic power control problem and its variants, and the third part is on<br\/>stochastic versions of the same problem.<br\/> In the first part of the proposed research, an improvement of distributed constrained power control<br\/>algorithm (PCPC), which is presently considered in the literature as the most efficient one, is suggested<br\/>via the use of the acceleration techniques for fixed-point iterations and via the use Krylov subspace<br\/>iterations (presently considered as the most efficient numerical method for solving systems of linear<br\/>large scale algebraic equations).<br\/> The second part of the proposal considers an optimal fast closed-loop SIR-based power control<br\/>scheme for 3-G wireless CDMA network, based on the recent research work of the author of this proposal<br\/>and his doctoral student. In addition of being optimal, the scheme obtained theoretically converges in one<br\/>iteration. This scheme follows perfectly channel variations and assumes that the link gains constantly<br\/>change in time. Due to the fact that the scheme needs a scalar discrete-time estimator (predictor), it<br\/>practically converges in 4-5 iterations. Simulations on a CDMA system demonstrate the effectiveness of<br\/>the optimal power control algorithm and its superiority over the corresponding IS-95 algorithm and the<br\/>present version of the DCPC algorithm. As a future research topic, a comparative analysis between the<br\/>optimized power control algorithm and the improved versions of the DCPC algorithm (accelerated and<br\/>Krylov subspace based) to be obtained in the first part of this proposal, is suggested first. Secondly, since<br\/>during optimization, the weighted sum of the transmission power and the SIR (signal-to-interference)<br\/>error, are jointly optimized, the power control problem can be put in the framework of Nash dynamic<br\/>games. It is suggested to extend the optimized power control results to capture the conflict situation<br\/>among users in a wireless network, which leads to the formulation of a Nash dynamic game problem.<br\/> The third part of this proposal deals with the stochastic formulation of the power control problem. This<br\/>is a pretty much new and widely open research problem. The basic problem formulation extends the<br\/>deterministic optimized power control problem to a stochastic environment, and leads to the linear power<br\/>evolution equation with additive Gaussian white noise. This problem formulation assumes that either link<br\/>gains or background noise or both are modeled as Gaussian white noise stochastic processes. Its variant<br\/>of colored background noise and colored link gains noise are also suggested for future research. In<br\/>addition, more realistic situations of state- and control-dependent noise using optimal control theory<br\/>results will be considered. The control variables will be the ones that regulate the convergence process of<br\/>the state variables (transmission powers and SIR errors) to their optimal values in a noisy environment.<br\/>Note that the state- and control-dependent noise optimal control problems in discrete-time domain have<br\/>been solved recently in the optimal control literature. In the final stage of this proposal, it is suggested to<br\/>study the power control problem assuming that the link gains change according to Poisson stochastic<br\/>processes.<br\/> The impact of the proposed research will be in the area of improvements of the capacity of 3-G<br\/>wireless CDMA networks, reliability of quality of service (QoS) and durability of user's battery life. All<br\/>these will be achieved by controlling interference in an optimal manner.","title":"Improvements and New Techniques for Deterministic and Stochastic SIR based Power Control for 3-G Wireless CDMA Networks","awardID":"0106857","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2005-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":[158160],"PO":["565090"]},"63808":{"abstract":"EIA-0116549<br\/>Claudio Rebbi<br\/>Boston University <br\/><br\/>MRI: Acquisition of a Power4-based IBM SP and PC-based Scalable Display Wall for Multidisciplinary Computational Science Research<br\/><br\/>This is a proposal for equipment acquisition under the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program to support research and student training across a broad range of advanced scientific computing applications.

A number of recent studies have demonstrated that long-range-dependence is<br\/>an important characteristic of traffic ows in current networking infrastructures. On the other hand,<br\/>the performance of networks and their ability to offer Quality of Service (QoS) depend on accurately<br\/>capturing (and exploiting) probabilistically rare phenomena. Studies of network performance with<br\/>long-range-dependent inputs are still very much in their infancy, and to-date have addressed only the<br\/>computation stationary buffer over ow probabilities.<br\/> In contrast, there is a crucial need to study the rare excursions of the underlying stochastic pro-<br\/>cesses which capture the salient characteristics of network ows, and to understand how such excursions<br\/>affect network dynamics. These issues are important from the point of view of transient characteristics<br\/>of networks. For example the QoS perceived by users depends not only on the magnitude of loss but<br\/>how it takes place. In some applications consecutive losses even if rare can make transmissions to be<br\/>severely degraded while in TCP, losing a small number packets often can result in deterioration in<br\/>performance. To study these effects we must develop new results on the duration of over ows and the<br\/>amount of information lost during typical over ows.<br\/> The goal of our research is to provide analytic insights, quantify performance, develop approaches<br\/>to measure relevant traffic parameters and provide rules-of-thumb for use in resource management and<br\/>scheduling traffic in networks with long-range dependent characteristics to meet QoS requirements.<br\/>The specific tasks that will be pursued to achieve our objectives are:<br\/> Study the buffer over ow asymptotics for multi-buffered systems with heterogeneous longtailed<br\/> inputs.<br\/> Develop results for the heterogeneous sub-exponential case.<br\/> Characterize the transient behavior during over ow periods for systems with longtailed and<br\/> sub-exponential inputs with a view to understanding actual QoS given to users.<br\/> Develop methods for differentiating between traffic types and estimating relevant parameters.<br\/> Incorporate the insights obtained from the above analyses into our overall objective to define<br\/> engineering rules for resource management and scheduling various types of sessions in networks.<br\/> As a result of these investigations we will have a complete catalog of results to handle the very<br\/>diverse types of traffic which are present in networks.

On the theo-<br\/>retical side the implications go beyond the traffic engineering context and are expected to contribute<br\/>to applied probability, queueing analysis and asymptotic approximation.

In this configuration, the performance of the database system is limited by how fast the memory subsystem can feed instructions and data to the processor. Traditional data storage and query processing techniques are optimized to minimize access to disks and do not effectively utilize the processor caches, resulting in poor query performance. The goal of this research project is to investigate, and experimentally evaluate, data storage and query processing techniques that can effectively utilize the processor caches. The approach consists of novel data storage techniques that can incrementally and transparently adapt the layout of data to better utilize the processor caches, cache-conscious indexing techniques for both traditional alphanumeric data and richer data types such as spatial data, and cache-conscious query evaluation and scheduling techniques. A prototype database system, called Quickstep, is being developed to experimentally evaluate the proposed techniques. The results of this project will produce techniques for efficient query evaluation in environments where the data is mostly resident in main-memory, with possible application in high-performance database servers powering Internet sites and future network routers that will require query processing for providing application-specific routing services. The education component of this project aims to introduce material in the graduate-level database course to expose students to the emerging confluence of databases and architectural technologies. The systems-building effort of this project provides an environment for training both undergraduate and graduate students in database implementation and performance evaluation techniques.","title":"CAREER: Quickstep: An Architecture-Conscious Main Memory DBMS","awardID":"0093059","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2007-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}}],"PIcoPI":["533271"],"PO":["563727"]},"56165":{"abstract":"The widespread need and ability to connect machines across the Internet, in a world where intelligent objects rather than documents are exchanged, has caused the network to be more vulnerable to intrusions and has facilitated break-ins of a variety of types. Most of the methods currently available to deal with network<br\/>vulnerability to abuse and attacks are either inadequate, inefficient oroverly restrictive. Compounding the<br\/>problem is the need to maintain an acceptable level of quality of service (QoS).<br\/> The proposed research project considers a heterogeneous network environment where servers, which<br\/>provide different levels of QoS support to clients through a contract protocol, are prone to faults and denial<br\/>of service attacks. The research project assumes the existence of intrusion detection mechanisms, and aims<br\/>at investigating new and potentially revolutionary approaches for the development of scalable and efficient<br\/>service deployment strategies and network resource management schemes to maintain acceptable levels of<br\/>QoS and security, despite faults. Two types of faults, namely, benign malfunctions and malicious intrusions,<br\/>will be considered. The former can be caused by a faulty, yet legitimate client that accidentally loses control<br\/>over its behavior, while the latter occurs with the intent to cause damage, such asDenial of Service (DoS).<br\/>Both types of faults can severely affect the performance of the network and compromise the integrity and<br\/>security of its services.<br\/> These faults can manifest themselves in the form of a protocol breach or a contract violation. The former<br\/>is exemplified by an authorized clients (impersonation may take place) who attempt to deliberately breach<br\/>the contract protocol and impact the behavior of the server to eventually cause its failure. Contract violation<br\/>occurs when a client attempts to acquire a level of service beyond what has been agreed upon in the service<br\/>contract. In order to protect the servers and the network, we propose two new techniques: fault avoidance,<br\/>based on the concept of replicated elusive servers, and fault tolerance, based on resource management schemes through the creation of a Virtually Isolated Network (VIN).<br\/> The concept of replicated elusive servers espouses ideas such as roaming addresses and frequent frequency<br\/>changes in wireless networks. Replication is coordinated through group communication supported by an<br\/>underlying multicast mechanism. VINs, on the other hand, provide the basis to achieve both physical and<br\/>logical separation (in space and time) of the resources reserved for each service, client, or class of clients.<br\/> Efficient management of network resources is achieved based on an integrative approach which considers<br\/>network performance, fault tolerance and security asintegral components of a multi-dimensional QoS space.<br\/>QoS support can then be perceived as a multi-layered optimization process which considers security, fault-<br\/>tolerance, resource allocation, communication protocol optimization and user level application management<br\/>as inhabitants of the same QoS spectrum and seeks to exploit tradeoffs in order to reach anoptimal operating<br\/>point. The techniques developed will be designed to handle multiple coordinated intrusions, clustered in<br\/>both space and time. A coordinated\/clustered fault model will be developed and a study of its effect on the<br\/>developed techniques and algorithms will be conducted.<br\/> The proposed research will build on a foundation of prior work developed by the PIs which have a<br\/>strong track record of success in a wide range of research topics related to fault-tolerance, operating system<br\/>development and resource management for QoS support in wired and wireless networks. It is anticipated<br\/>that through algorithms development and analysis, simulation and testbed implementations, the results of<br\/>this project will lead to a better understanding of how to provide efficient support to QoS performance,<br\/>fault-tolerance and securityin an integrated manner, both in wired and wireless environments. An equally<br\/>important contribution of this project will be the training of high quality students in a field where expertise<br\/>is scarce.","title":"Secure Virtually Isolated Networks to Avoid and Tolerate Denial of Service","awardID":"0087609","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2005-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["533851","554329"],"PO":["565090"]},"67099":{"abstract":"EIA-0131899<br\/>Dickerson, Allan<br\/>Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University<br\/><br\/><br\/>SUMMARY<br\/><br\/>Cells routinely perform complex computational tasks that enable them to control the orchestration<br\/>of thousands of genes and communicate with other cells to manifest emergent properties such as growth<br\/>and differentiation.Understanding and engineering the algorithms underlying the complex computational<br\/>machinery of cells should have significant impact in science and technology,particularly biotechnology,<br\/>biocomputation and medicine.<br\/><br\/>Several notable recent reports demonstrate that it is possible to design and construct simple de<br\/>novo genetic circuits such as a switch and an oscillator in Escherichia coli .This work also revealed that<br\/>implementation of even the most simple circuits in vivo requires tedious optimization of often poorly-<br\/>understood protein-DNA interactions and mRNA and protein stabilities,among other parameters.We<br\/>propose to develop efficient,evolutionary design strategies for constructing functional de novo genetic<br\/>circuits.We will apply methods of molecular evolution,which have proven highly successful for<br\/>engineering proteins with improved or altered properties,to complex genetic systems involving multiple<br\/>repressors,operators,and promoters.We believe that evolution will prove to be generally applicable for<br\/>optimizing individual devices as well as complex genetic circuits,and our goal will be to demonstrate<br\/>how evolutionary searches are best performed in order to build libraries of devices and assemble them<br\/>into functional circuits.","title":"Biodiversity and Ecosystem Informatics - BDEI -Bioinformatic Prediction of Functions of Unculturable Microbes in Ecosystems","awardID":"0131899","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2003-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1706","name":"DIGITAL GOVERNMENT"}}],"PIcoPI":["310658","559294"],"PO":["371077"]},"64492":{"abstract":"This 1-year empirical pilot study will investigate the reasons for the under-representation women majoring in Information Technology(IT) related disciplines in institutions of higher education.

Mobile radio networks (or ad<br\/>hoc networks) are required in situations where the network itself must be highly mobile and<br\/>where access to a fixed infrastructure of base stations is not available. To meet demands of<br\/>portability and low-power operation, it is desirable for a single ad hoc network to service the<br\/>traffic demands of a wide range of applications, including examples such as all-informed<br\/>multicast voice, real-time video, large file transfers, and interactive web browsing. Each class of<br\/>traffic has specific service requirements and these QOS levels must be provided from a mobile<br\/>and distributed network that operates with battery power only and with very limited bandwidth.<br\/> The Wireless Communications Program at Clemson University has recognized that<br\/>strong interaction among different protocol layers in ad hoc radio networks is not only desirable<br\/>but in fact essential. A single protocol layer cannot guarantee a specific quality of service for a<br\/>traffic type, but there must be coordination among the routing, queuing, traffic scheduling,<br\/>congestion control, channel-access, and adaptive-transmission protocols.

In these domains analog signal representation is essential for many input modalities such as instrumentation, sensor interfaces, and communications. Likewise, there are related output applications, such as biomedical actuation and industrial control. In addition, the needs of wireless and fiber-optical communication have reinvigorated analog design. However, there are serious problems concerning how to keep these analog components on a reasonable scaling curve as Moore's law continues unabated in the digital domain, and in integrating analog representations into large, complex digital systems (\"system on a chip\").<br\/><br\/>The purpose of this proposal is to study a new approach to representing analog signals that we believe will integrate more cleanly into these deep submicron, single-chip systems. Today analog signals are almost exclusively represented by current or voltage quantities. Our proposal is to borrow a page from neuroscience and to use the Inter-Pulse-Interval (IPI) between single-bit, asynchronous pulses to represent analog quantities. We are proposing to develop a mixed-mode analog\/digital cell library and design methodology based on IPI representation and the associated computation elements, and to engineer a case study to illustrate the outcomes. <br\/><br\/>As we move to deep submicron and then on to the nanometer\/molecular devices, the problems that digital encounters with scaling, such as threshold inconsistency, subthreshold currents, hot-electron effects, doping variability, substrate coupling, and transmission line and complex cross-talk effects, are even more serious for analog circuitry. IPI representations will provide significantly better immunity to these effects, as well as to the more traditional process, temperature, and reference voltage variations. For most applications, pulse based analog systems will require less power. There are numerous advantages to using pulses or pulses to communicate. They are significantly more immune to noise. An approximate analogy would be that of AM versus FM radio signal representation.

The estimation of phylogenies is crucial to a wide range of basic and applied biological problems such as the epidemiology of AIDS, the identification of viral agents, the analysis of protein structure and function, the prediction of RNA structure; and, of course, it is the basic tool for inferring evolutionary history. Methods for the reconstruction of phylogenies are most commonly applied to DNA sequences. In many cases these sequences change at rates that are too low or too high for recovering accurate evolutionary trees. One new type data that is fast gaining favor in the biology community is gene order and content within whole genomes, but so far very few computational methods have been developed for these types of data. <br\/><br\/>The three goals of the project are to: (1) develop algorithms and software for reconstructing evolutionary trees from gene order and content data; (2) assess the performance of these algorithms through extensive simulation studies under parameter-rich models of genome evolution and through application to real datasets; and (3) develop high-performance implementations of the best algorithms designed in the project using algorithm engineering techniques and a flexible approach to parallelization. This project will make significant contributions in biology, through the development of new models of genome evolution and an improved understanding of the evolution of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes, and in computer science, through the development and testing of new algorithms for genomic data and the application of high-performance computing to problems in phylogenetic analysis.","title":"ITR\/AP(DEB): Collaborative Research `Computing Optimal Phylogenetic Trees under Genome Rearrangement Metrics'","awardID":"0113654","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2005-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["456506"],"PO":["565136"]},"67102":{"abstract":"EIA-0131912<br\/>Beard-Tisdale, Mary-Kate<br\/>University of Maine<br\/><br\/>BDEI: Event and process tagging for information integration for the International Gulf of Maine Watershed<br\/><br\/>Project Summary<br\/><br\/>This incubation proposal addresses the issue of integrating large, diverse, and autonomous<br\/>collections of scientific data within a complex institutional setting.

Hierarchical graphs have emerged as a powerful knowledge representation structures, however existing database and data mining techniques are not able to manage the extreme combinatorial complexities required to compare, classify, index and cluster these structures as primitive data elements. Research challenges include (1) capturing the inner structure of graph based models, and their topological sub-structures, to use for pattern matching purposes; (2) classify the stability of these approximation techniques in the presence of noise; (3) identifying how to translate these techniques into suitable database mechanisms. The basis of the approach is a mapping of the topological structure of a graph into a low-dimensional vector space through an eigenvalue characterization. This SGER studies these problems in the context of collaborative and distributed engineering design, where teams of agents (human and computational) interact over the network to realize a product (e.g., software, electro-mechanical device, building, etc.). This process is modeled as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that encodes the design modeling operations and decisions, as well as the flow of the information along the modeling time-steps. Knowledge acquisition agents will be fielded to capture these knowledge structures and a validation of the theoretical methodology for indexing and reuse of process knowledge will performed. Some of this work will be done in collaboration with Bentley Systems. If successful, these techniques will lead to dramatic new possibilities for database and information management systems: allowing them to efficiently store complex graphs as single large objects and identify useful patterns in and across large sets of these combinatorial structures.","title":"SGER: Algorithmic Infrastructure for Knowledge Management","awardID":"0136337","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2002-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6856","name":"ARTIFICIAL INTELL & COGNIT SCI"}}],"PIcoPI":["560676","366025"],"PO":["563751"]},"62890":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/><br\/>Information Technology Research (ITR)<br\/><br\/>Small Proposal<br\/><br\/><br\/>Proposal Id: EIA-0112688<br\/>Investigator: Denis Lee<br\/>Institution: Suffolk University<br\/>Title: ITR\/PE: Knowledge Acquisition and Effective Development of Information Technologies\/Systems Workers<br\/><br\/>This award provides support for a 3-year research study to examine the changing knowledge and skill requirements for different types of Information Technology (IT) \/Information Systems (IS) work.

This project is pursuing a fundamental experimental advance in one potential arena for the implementation of these theoretical ideas is proposed: the synthesis of optical and atomic quantum information resources through cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED). While theoretical developments indicate that CQED devices offer a scalable and powerful architecture for quantum information processing, a key missing element which stands in the way of further progress is the deterministic loading of the atom-cavity system. To mend this gap, a powerful yet straightforward integration of the experimental techniques of laser cooling, magnetic trapping and Bose-Einstein condensation with cavity quantum electrodynamics is underway. This synthesis is clearly beneficial to quantum information processing, combining well controlled, stationary qubits comprised of trapped atoms wherein quantum information is stored in long-lived internal states, \"flying qubits\" in the form of photons emitted from the cavity, and a means of strongly coupling the two. This ambitious effort will enable a broad range of breakthroughs and innovations in the field of quantum information science.<br\/><br\/>For this project, an evaporatively-cooled, and at times quantum degenerate, atomic gas is produced outside the confines of a high-finesse optical cavity, and then adiabatically placed inside the cavity to provide a reservoir of ultracold atoms. Single atoms, or a countable number of atoms, are \"activated\" from this \"passive\" reservoir by a transition between atomic hyperfine states, and are then used for a wide range of basic applications with direct relevance to quantum information and communication schemes. These applications include the generation of single photons on demand, the generation of non-classical number states of the optical field, the implementation of Raman CQED by which the atom-cavity system can be programmatically switched on and off, and an exploration of quantum and non-linear optical properties of quantum degenerate gases at the single photon level.","title":"Quantum-QuBIC: Deterministic Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics for Quantum Information Studies","awardID":"0130414","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2004-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1708","name":"QuBIC"}}],"PIcoPI":["553504"],"PO":["565223"]},"63023":{"abstract":"This project will use computer shape matching algorithms to assemble the remaining fragments of the Forma Urbis Romae, a giant marble map of ancient Rome.

Pioneering studies including those of [Moore, 79] and [Keyes, 87] identified the possibility of sustained exponential improvements in key semiconductor device parameters, as well as the significant obstacles that would need to be overcome to maintain such a pace. The enormous intellectual and financial investment into that effort has translated into steady improvements in overall system performance, so that now more and more computer applications are less and less resource-bound. But what's typically been missed in forecasts such as the Semiconductor Industry Association's influential roadmap is a projection of the relevance of the whole scaling effort. A narrow focus on improving device performance ignores the importance of the context in which computers are used, which is leading to very real scaling limits that are among the most serious obstacles to further progress. These include the economics of producing both chips and chip fabs, and the difficulty of designing and managing very large-scale systems. Beyond their practical significance, these issues present some of the most profound research questions in all of information technology, but they are questions that crucially cut across traditional discipline boundaries. Most importantly, it is no longer possible to maintain the fiction that developing hardware can be neatly separated from developing software. <br\/><br\/>The Center for Bits and Atoms is an ambitious attempt to close this historical divide by bringing together the resources required to simultaneously study the content of information and its physical properties, on length scales from atomic nuclei to global networks. It aims to develop architectures for scaling information technology appropriate to each of these levels of description, and through a network of partnerships deploy these capabilities for the greatest global impact. Along the way, it seeks to fundamentally revisit the notion of what is a computer, and what is a computation. The CBA's program is based on the belief that the most significant of all the obstacles to progress has been the isolation of the investigation of each these pieces from that of the larger whole that they promise to enable. <br\/><br\/>The research agenda is organized into three layers, in order of accessibility and importance. The first of these addresses system-level questions, asking how to extend networks of (relatively) conventional processors up to and beyond billions of interacting entities. Such coming complexity is being driven by countless practical applications, but will break the existing protocols used to operate the Internet as well as the techniques used for managing it. The approach taken here will be to \"de-layer\" the divisions between physical transport, logical connection, and application implementation, so that when devices are connected they simultaneously create a network, a distributed data structure, and the computer to manipulate it. The algorithms for processing and routing information are crucially assembled as the components are assembled, and autonomously adapt as nodes come and go, so that scalability is literally built in as the system grows. De-layering also beneficially exposes the capabilities of low-level devices to high-level applications (and vice versa), so that rich interfaces such as sensor networks can become the norm rather than the exception. <br\/><br\/>The second layer builds on this system-level insight to ask about technologies to meet the demand for embedding billions of computers into everyday objects. Even though the cost per transistor has fallen exponentially for decades, the minimum cost per packaged part has remained relatively unchanged over the whole VLSI scaling era. For such large-scale systems to be compatible with the global GDP, it's necessary to fundamentally rethink the nature of device fabrication. The approach in the CBA will be to seek to eliminate central chip fabs entirely, using table-top printing technologies to move the production of computers to where and when they are needed. The fundamental enabling insight that makes this possible is the use of nanocrystalline electronically-active inks. Not only does this promise to dramatically reduce the cost per part, it offers a route from mass-production to the customization of the design of computers, as well as a way to grow from 2D to 3D architectures. <br\/><br\/>The third (and most speculative) layer asks about the fundamental mechanisms for manipulating information that will be enabled by this agenda. It seeks to apply the insights that will be developed into programming enormous imperfect distributed systems and accessibly fabricating nanoscale structures in order to harness the intrinsic computational capabilities of natural systems. Fundamental to this approach is the conviction that progress towards these long-standing goals","title":"ITR\/SY: Center for Bits and Atoms","awardID":"0122419","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2008-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1688","name":"ITR LARGE GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2878","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CCF"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"9199","name":"UNDISTRIBUTED PANEL\/IPA FUNDS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"S074","name":"CIA"}}],"PIcoPI":["390875","560692","497072","341404"],"PO":["549626"]},"64178":{"abstract":"For many recent applications, the concept of a data stream, possibly infinite, is more appropriate than a data set. By nature, a stored data set is appropriate when significant portions of the data are queried again and again, and updates are small and\/or relatively infrequent. In contrast, a data stream is appropriate when the data is changing constantly (often exclusively through insertions of new elements), and it is either unnecessary or impractical to operate on large portions of the data multiple times. The goal of this research project is to develop models and techniques for the management and processing of data streams. Sampling, summarization, and online approximation algorithms will be employed to facilitate query processing and data mining over streams. The results of this project will provide efficient data stream techniques for data management, memory management, query processing, data mining, and data analysis. In addition, a software prototype will be developed for experimentation with algorithms and query processing, and as a testbed for some sample applications of significant scope, such as networking monitoring and traffic engineering, and medical monitoring data.","title":"Management and Processing of Data Streams","awardID":"0118173","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2005-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}}],"PIcoPI":["401830","250071"],"PO":["563751"]},"61022":{"abstract":"This project provides for international technology assessments and related workshop and staff support.

The work will focus on two related thrusts. First, low vision simulation methods will be developed that accurately show people with normal vision what the world looks like to people with visual deficits. The goal is to develop simulation tools that designers can use to understand the visual limitations (and abilities) of people with low vision and thereby eliminate barriers to access from their designs. Applications in the areas of architectural design, driving safety, and the development of graphical user interfaces will be demonstrated. Second, the PIs will develop low vision image enhancement tools that can be used to transform images from digital cameras or graphics applications to create new images that are more comprehensible to people with low vision. The objective is to use computational models of low vision to develop image enhancement algorithms that can be incorporated into digital imaging systems to give people with low vision better access to the visual world. The PIs plan to use these algorithms to develop two new kinds of assistive technology: image profiling and enhancement tools for Web browsers to enable low vision access to Web-based graphical information; and portable augmented vision systems that can facilitate orientation, mobility and object recognition for people with low vision. The hope is that the methods developed will provide better understanding of the challenges facing people with low vision, and lead to effective assistive technologies that can help people with low vision live easier, fuller and more productive lives.","title":"ITR\/PE: Digital Imaging Techniques for the Simulation and Enhancement of Low Vision","awardID":"0113310","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2006-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["429027","474957"],"PO":["565227"]},"63024":{"abstract":"This project will attack several important problems in image processing and computer vision.

One way of catering to this demand is by multiplexing in time as<br\/>well as wavelength domains. Using picosecond-duration optical pulses, which could be soliton-like over<br\/>portions of the network, one can first perform multiplexing in the time domain (i.e., time-division multiplexing, or TDM) for local to metropolitan-area network applications and then in the wavelength domain (wavelength-division multiplexing, or WDM) for wide area coverage. This scenario leads one to conclude that the key issue to be addressed is how to take advantage of the powerful digital-processing techniques in the pure-optical domain, that minimize the detrimental effects of noise at a very fundamental level. The idea is that, for digitally encoded data [1's (0's) represented by the presence (absence) of pulses], instead of using linear amplifiers which act on signals in an analog fashion and inevitably introduce 3 dB of noise one can employ digital-switching amplifiers or optical regenerators. At the same time, pure-optical digital switching is potentially much more reliable and faster than electro-optical switching. Furthermore, optical switching will also be needed to implement other networking functions, such as demultiplexing to process at very high speed the header of a data packet used for addressing to different users on the network.<br\/> Our preliminary experiments show that the parametric nonlinearity of optical fibers can be exploited<br\/>to perform functionalities that will be needed in packet-switched all-optical networks, such as fiber-optic<br\/>cache-memory buffers, picosecond-pulse all-optical regenerators, all-optical limiters, and tunable clock re-covery modules. These devices take advantage of the ultrafast parametric nonlinearity of glass fiber and<br\/>hence are capable of operating at speeds in excess of 100 Gb\/s. Moreover, they will be essential for deploying<br\/>packet-switched, ultrahigh-speed time-division and wavelength-division multiplexed all-optical networks.<br\/> In all of our experiments thus far, standard dispersion-shifted fiber (DSF) has been used. Fiber lengths<br\/>on the order of 100's of meters are required for used with ps-duration pulses of a few watts peak power to<br\/>achieve the data processing functions. Here we propose to explore the use of high-nonlinearity fiber, such<br\/>as microstructure fiber (MF, which is only now becoming commercially available), to perform essential<br\/>functions in high-speed all-optical processing. Because of their strongly guiding behavior, the MFs can<br\/>be wound into very tight loops, suggesting that they could potentially fit into a compact modular switching<br\/>package. Specifically, we propose to utilize the high-nonlinearity microstructure fibers to develop all-optical data processing modules. These include a cache storage buffer based upon parametric amplification that will be capable of operating in the 10's of Gb\/s range. With use of the high-nonlinearity fiber, the average pump power requirement can be met with commercially-available watt-class optical amplifiers. We will carry out experiments to explore various ways of reading, writing, and erasing the stored data patterns.<br\/>Our work has shown that the ultrafast parametric nonlinearity can be exploited either to provide broadband<br\/>tunable gain or dynamic gain modulation for clock-recovery. We propose to combine the two to demonstrate<br\/>optical phase-lock loops, which in principle can be extremely fast as they rely on the Kerr nonlinearity<br\/>for envelope-phase discrimination. Simultaneous to the above experimental studies we will also develop<br\/>numerical models of the various optical systems. This will provide a design tool to determine the parameter<br\/>values allowing the most efficient operation of the experimental setups. We have previously demonstrated<br\/>the possibility of stably propagating sub-picosecond pulses in fiber lines in which conjugating gain is used<br\/>to compensate the linear loss. We propose to assemble a re-circulating loop experiment in which linear loss<br\/>will be compensated by a pair of non-degenerate parametric (conjugating) amplifiers. The location of the<br\/>two amplifiers will be chosen based upon further theoretical\/numerical results. We will experimentally and<br\/>theoretically study the stability properties of the sub-picosecond pulses by making various signal and noise<br\/>measurements, and will compare the experimental results directly with numerical simulations.","title":"Ultra-High-Capacity Optical Communications and Networking: Data processing modules using high-nonlinearity fiber for advanced optical networking","awardID":"0123495","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2005-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4090","name":"ADVANCED NET INFRA & RSCH"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0702","name":"Division of CHEM, BIOENG, ENV, &  TRANSP S","abbr":"CBET"},"pgm":{"id":"1517","name":"ELECT, PHOTONICS, & MAG DEVICE"}}],"PIcoPI":["515242","523602"],"PO":["565090"]},"57239":{"abstract":"EIA-0091533<br\/>Judith Klavans <br\/>Columbia University<br\/><br\/>Digital Government Research Center (DGRC): Bringing Complex Data to Users<br\/><br\/>In partnership with the Federal Energy Information Agency on the topic of trade data, Columbia University and the Information Sciences Institute of the University of Southern California will work in three areas of relevance to the Agency mission:<br\/><br\/>1.

The ability to meet a target is quantified by a utility function. Existing optimizers and their cost model consider either specific values or expected values for access costs, and are not sensitive to performance targets.

Although the immediate impact of sea level rise may be less severe than other effects of global climate change, the long-term consequences can be much more devastating since nearly 60% of the world population lives in coastal regions. Scientists have postulated that excess water is being released from polar ice sheets due to long-term, global climate change, but there are insufficient data to confirm these theories. Understanding the interactions between the ice sheets, oceans and atmosphere is essential to quantifying the role of ice sheets in sea level rise. Toward that end, this research project involves the innovative application of information technology in the development and deployment of intelligent radar sensors for measuring key glaciological parameters. <br\/><br\/>Radar instrumentation will consist of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) that can operate in bistatic or monostatic mode. One important application of the SAR will be in the determination of basal conditions, particularly the presence and distribution of basal water. Basal water lubricates the ice\/bed interface, enhancing flow, and increasing the amount of ice discharged into the ocean. Another application of the SAR will be to measure ice thickness and map internal layers in both shallow and deep ice. Information on near-surface internal layers will be used to estimate the average, recent accumulation rate, while the deeper layers provide a history of past accumulation and flow rates. A tracked vehicle and an automated snowmobile will be used to test and demonstrate the utility of an intelligent radar in glaciological investigations.<br\/><br\/>The system will be developed to collect, process and analyze data in real time and in conjunction with a priori information derived from archived sources.

This project studies decision trees, one of the most widely used data mining models. The approach addresses three complementary components of decision tree construction: Bias in split selection, pruning, and regression tree construction. Bias in split selection is a very important problem, as the choice of the \"wrong\" split attribute destroys the interpretability of the decision tree, and users can no longer trust the information from the tree. Through a large experimental study and a theoretical investigation, this project develops a framework to devise split selection methods with absolutely zero bias. The new methods will permit users of decision trees to interpret the tree without any doubt of misinformation. The second topic addresses pruning of decision trees. Through a large experimental study of pruning of decision trees for large datasets, the project investigates the computational and qualitative trade-offs between different pruning methods, solving an ongoing debate about how to prune with large datasets. Third, this research investigates scalable regression tree construction, developing methods to construct regression trees with linear models in the leaf nodes of the tree and multivariate splits at intermediate nodes - all completely scalable over very large datasets with millions of records. The results are implemented in a publicly available decision tree construction tool and performance testbed and software contribution to the research community.

The overarching question our students are trained to investigate is the following: how is it possible for an agent to decide what actions to take to achieve long-term goals? We recognize that decision-making in complex environments is a sequential process, involving a series of episodes in which an agent, based on information available through its senses and stored in memory, selects the action appropriate for its goals. The problem is made difficult by perceptual uncertainty arising from sensory limitations and environmental complexity, by the challenge of sorting through the large space of actions available, and by inherent delays in feedback about the long-term consequences of actions. A wide variety of fundamental cognitive tasks can be cast as sequential decision-making problems. Understanding how such problems may be solved will be a critical component of a general theory of intelligent behavior in organisms, and will be essential for the design of truly intelligent machines. To study these problems, we adopt a comparative approach, combining insights from a range of model systems, including humans, non-human animals, robots, and intelligent software agents. This multidisciplinary framework will enable students to integrate ideas and methods from different fields that have been concerned with the study of sequential decision-making (psychology, behavioral biology, linguistics, and computer science), but that have so far remained largely separate. The training program is designed to create a new generation of scientists trained in this innovative, multidisciplinary approach. Graduate training will be focused on fundamental disciplinary education, a common set of courses focused on the sequential decision-making framework, and a strong emphasis on mentored, interdisciplinary research activities that span each student's entire graduate program.<br\/><br\/>IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing new, innovative models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. In the fourth year of the program, awards are being made to twenty-two institutions for programs that collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF. The intellectual foci of this specific award reside in the Directorates for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences; Computer and Information Science and Engineering; Engineering; Biological Sciences; and Education and Human Resources.","title":"IGERT: A Unified Approach to Sequential Decision-Making in Cognitive Science","awardID":"0114378","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2008-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6856","name":"ARTIFICIAL INTELL & COGNIT SCI"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0705","name":"Division of ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND CENT","abbr":"EEC"},"pgm":{"id":"1360","name":"HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1101","name":"Division of GRADUATE EDUCATION","abbr":"DGE"},"pgm":{"id":"1335","name":"IGERT FULL PROPOSALS"}}],"PIcoPI":["429720","185113","502856","520062","544475"],"PO":["434633"]},"63037":{"abstract":"EIA-0113519<br\/>Dawn J.

Initially the focus will be on local users on the Oregon Coast. However, there is great potential that the technologies can serve as a general model for similar efforts throughout North America, by developing an interactive, Internet-accessible information management system that incorporates a variety of geospatial data and analysis tools within a common framework. End-user training and direct technical assistance are incorporated into the development of this system, as are back-end system maintenance tools to ensure system longevity. This will enable coastal decision-makers at all government levels, the public, and research scientists to more easily find and use relevant, timely geospatial information. In this way universal participation in coastal decision making among coastal communities can be improved by extending community-expanding infrastructure to public offices that would otherwise face difficulties accessing IT services and resources.<br\/><br\/>Specifically, a web-based data sharing depot will be built, with integrated Internet mapping and tool building capabilities to provide the coordination that resource managers and scientists need to tackle the interdisciplinary topic-based issues characteristic of the coastal zone. The infrastructure will be designed so that it is scalable over time both in size and in audience and encouraging of 2-way contributions by more advanced participant users. Much of this infrastructure will be generic, of use to many areas of interdisciplinary research in the natural sciences. The infrastructure, called the Oregon Coastal Atlas (OCA) will include:<br\/>1. A web-based electronic repository that will hold not only physical observations (traditional data),text, video and graphics, but also information about computational elements (programs, models, tools, and scripts for computational processing);<br\/>2.

Participants in the enterprise can use these results to select appropriate operational strategies in order to improve local performance measures such as profit or cash flow over a fixed planning horizon. In addition, these models will provide insight into the mechanisms that result in effective alliances and organizational designs. The modeling approach has three steps. First, a representation scheme is developed for capturing characteristics of individual participants that incorporates task information, organizational relationships, local and system level goals, and possible changes in the environment. An enterprise is thus a collection of several of such detailed representations for each organization and the interactions between these organizations. Second, a micro-macro modeling approach is developed, where the details of each agent's tasks (represented in the micro-level simulation framework) are aggregated into a set of interaction parameters at the macro-level. The macro-level enterprise model is formulated as an interacting particle system. Finally, the third step involves validation of the theories developed using field data. Field data will be collected from different industries that have large number of participants in the supply network, such as the food industry and the automotive industry, to construct practical agent representations and to verify the theoretical performance estimates. Large-scale simulations using a multi-agent simulator will also be used to empirically estimate the performance of a given organizational configuration. <br\/><br\/>This research will allow planners to estimate a priori the overall enterprise performance under different operating conditions, and eventually, design optimal emergent societies.

To deal with this aspect of computation implies that one cannot ignore the I\/O gap and only concentrate on processor-centric issues. As a concrete example, the size of Genbank, a nucleotide database, has been doubling every 14 months and is currently 33 GB. In the commercial arena attention has turned to information and its location also. More and more network services, fueled by the demands of information-intensive Web applications, are shifting the focus in computer systems to I\/O.<br\/><br\/>With the growing importance of data comes the need to address its management. The commodity cluster of the near future, which consists of a combination of network-attached storage, intelligent data appliances and workstations, and high-performance networks, is a highly parallel, heterogeneous computer. However, the file abstractions in use today cannot yet fully exploit either the resulting computational power or data locality.<br\/><br\/>This award examines how to improve I\/O performance on such a platform for a class of important applications. UC Santa Cruz has a leading computational biology group with a 100+ node Linux cluster; the parallel sequencing codes that they use are an obvious target. Other groups have also expressed interest in this cluster; and its use will be an excellent source of applications. <br\/><br\/>There are three main research objectives. First, develop an I\/O programming model that unites computation and storage. This will allow the programmer to express \"storage operations\" that can be readily parallelized. Second, build an adaptive infrastructure and develop analytic models to determine the optimal execution path, which may be parallel or sequential. Third, develop offline models to answer questions about how to allocate resources within this heterogeneous environment.<br\/><br\/>The goal in creating a new I\/O interface is to associate computation and data so that code can be easily executed at the source of the data. For example, suppose we want to search for a word in a dictionary. The standard procedure would be to open the dictionary file, read it in chunks, search for instances of the word in each chunk, and close the file. This operation is sequential and processor-centric; the emphasis is on moving the data to the processor rather than a computation to the data. Instead, we propose to associate a \"search for word\" command with the dictionary in the form of a new I\/O interface.

The availability of such a locomotion interface would have impacts on a broad range of applications, including education and training, design and prototyping, physical fitness, and rehabilitation; for some of these applications natural walking provides a level of realism not obtainable if movement through the simulated world is controlled by devices such as a joystick, while for others realistic walking is a fundamental requirement. Prototypes have been built for a variety of computer-controlled devices on which a person can walk, but there has been little investigation of the utility of such devices as interfaces to a virtual world and almost no study at all of the interactions of visual and biomechanical perceptual cues in such devices. This project addresses key open questions, the answers to which are needed if locomotion interfaces are to offer effective interaction between users and computer simulations. An effective locomotion interface must provide users with accurate visual and biomechanical sensations of walking; thus, a key objective of this work is to determine how to synergistically combine visual information generated by computer graphics with biomechanical information generated by devices that simulate walking on real surfaces. Thompson and his collaborators will investigates methods that allow more accurate walking in a locomotion interface while accurately conveying a sense of the spaces being walked through. Specific issues to be considered include how to facilitate the perception of speed and distance traveled, how to provide a compelling sense of turning when actual walking along a curved path is not possible, how to give a user the sense that he\/she is walking over a sloped surface, and more generally how to give a user a clear sense of the scale and structure of the spaces being walked through.

Often these individuals can walk in controlled environments, but lack the strength to recover from large force disturbances encountered in the real world. Such individuals might be helped if a lightweight, active, leg orthosis occasionally acted to compensate large forces and stabilize gait when a fall is immanent. There are three technical and two scientific challenges that must be addressed to make such a device possible. Technically, the system must be very lightweight, have no need for external (e.g. e.m.g.) sensors, and have a battery that lasts at least an entire day. Scientifically, the system must act with appropriate mechanical behavior and be able to estimate the user's ground-relative limb configuration and motive intent based on a minimum of sensory information. All five of these issues will be addressed in this study. On the Educational frontier, the subject of computer architecture is one of the most rapidly evolving in the field of electrical engineering and computer science. In order to teach computer architecture to undergraduates, we must give them a laboratory substrate that is both motivating (in that students can build circuits that solve interesting problems in real time) and not prohibitively difficult to use.

One highly spectrally efficient link architecture is the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture, which uses multiple transmit antennas and multiple receive antennas. Under ideal conditions, the theoretical capacity of a MIMO channel increases linearly in the number of transmit\/receive antennas. In other words, the theory promises that more bits can be conveyed through the same bandwidth by simply adding more antennas at each end of the link. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a high-data rate modulation technique that is already part of some single-transmitter communications standards and is known for its scalability and its convenient and cost-effective implementation using standard digital signal processing architectures. This study seeks to determine how to combine OFDM with MIMO architectures over real channels. A challenging goal of this research is to arrive at a flexible, scaleable, wireless modem with bandwidth efficiency on the order of 4 to 10 bits per second per Hertz.<br\/><br\/>The study will include analysis of the major functions of the physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers. Hardware experimentation will include MIMO channel measurements, including characterization of MIMO interference, and verification of the MIMO OFDM link in real-time on a software radio test-bed. Methods for performing MIMO OFDM channel estimation and synchronization jointly over the spatial channels are being investigated, taking into account noise and channel estimation and synchronization errors. An adaptive transmitter is also being studied that combines space-time processing based on singular-value decomposition (SVD) with adaptive modulation. Solutions to the major transmission impairments in OFDM systems, which include intersymbol interference (ISI) due to insufficient guard interval, interference from co-channel systems, and the effects of amplifier non-linearities on OFDM will be sought for MIMO OFDM systems. To provide data reliability, the combination of space-time coding, Turbo coding with iterative receivers, and hybrid ARQ strategies for error control across the PHY and MAC layers are being considered. Finally, media access protocols will be optimized to work with the parameters of the OFDM air interface, such as the OFDM symbol period.","title":"ITR\/SI: Broadband MIMO OFDM Wireless Access","awardID":"0121565","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2005-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["343207","562753","507792","386026","562754"],"PO":["564898"]},"64722":{"abstract":"Collaborative Research: ITR\/AP&IM Data Intense Challenge: <br\/>The Instrumented Oil Field of the Future<br\/><br\/>Mary Wheeler - University of Texas at Austin - 0121523<br\/>Alan Sussman - University of Maryland, College Park - 0121161<br\/>Joel Saltz - Ohio State University Research Foundation - 0121177<br\/>Manish Parashar - Rutgers University - 0120934<br\/><br\/><br\/>Increasing production from existing oil and natural gas reservoirs is crucial for the US economy.

In the future, wireless data traffic will be increasingly dominated by a variety of multimedia, such as real-time video, email, web downloads, as opposed to voice transmission. \"Tether-free communication and networking', as envisioned by the Information Technology Research program, requires intensive research into handling the transmission of multimedia over the wireless channel. Various multimedia have very different traffic characteristics than voice, being characterized by different delay constraints and burstiness. Handling bursty data has been addressed primarily in the networking communit. The community has focussed on the relationship among the traffic delay constraint, the packet loss rate (which is assumed to be the packet drop rate), and the channel capacity, captured by measures such as \"Effective bandwidth'. Networking problems in wired (fiber, copper, etc.) media have been successfully solved by this approach, because this channel is inherently a low-error channel. However, the networking community has by and large ignored the fact that there is a very real, non-idea physical channel on which this data is carried. Therefore, the migration of these approaches to the wireless medium meets a significant obstacle- the fact that the wireless channel is inherently a very noisy, non-robust channel. Thus for wireless channels, it is important to consider the effect on packet loss of both, burstiness and channel errors. Researchers have been approaching the issue of considering both these effects in (the PI believes) an ad hoc manner. This proposal intends to approach the issue in a systematic and logical manner. Specifically, the PI proposes to introduce a joint measure of burstiness and channel condition, and use the measure to solve the key problem of allocating scarce resources among competing users of a wireless system. The proposed joint approach is a fundamental change in paradigm, since it attempts to synthesize ideas from the Networking and Communication Theory communities. The reason why source burstiness as well as channel errors (due to noise, fading, etc.) affect the standard notions of channel capacity, is due to the requirement of finite delay in the data communication. The PI has therefore developed an initial set of measures (details in the full proposal) that relate the delay and packet loss. The measure is based on the random coding error exponent approach, developed in an information theoretic setting. To reduce the packet drop probability, the wireless transmitter must transmit at as high a data rate as possible. But a high rate of transmission would imply a high packet error probability on the wireless channel, due to transmission errors. The measure developed by the PI attempts to capture this trade-off. Preliminary analysis indicates that using this measure indeed offers a substantial benefit (in terms of designing an optimum system) for bursty traffic transmission over fading wireless channels. The first step in the current research would be to refine the developed joint measure. This would involve using more sophisticated source traffic models, more sophisticated fading channel models, and practical channel coding schemes. The developed measure will then be used to design optimal or robust schemes (as the need may be) to allocate wireless resources to competing streams of data traffic. This will involve developing scheduling flow control algorithms, and the associated adaptive channel coding schemes, using the joint measure. In summary, this research will introduce a fundamentally new paradigm for transmission optimization of bursty data traffic over wireless channels, and then demonstrate the usefulness of the new paradigm in practical situations.","title":"ITR\/SI: Wireless Transmission Optimization for Bursty Data Traffic","awardID":"0111818","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2004-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["518488"],"PO":["250082"]},"64744":{"abstract":"We propose to organize yearly, intensive six-week research workshops<br\/>at Johns Hopkins University, focusing on Language Engineering,<br\/>including the mutually related areas of automatic speech recognition<br\/>and synthesis, natural language processing, machine translation,<br\/>information extraction and summarization.

Therefore, it is critically important to have a safe and rigorous solution to handle the<br\/>above two issues.<br\/>Policy Specification Correctness<br\/>Currently, in the research community of IPSec\/VPN policy, to our best knowledge, no rigorous definition<br\/>for IPSec\/VPN policy correctness has been developed. Later in this proposal, we will give a formal and<br\/>reasonable definition for correctness such that we will have a basis for policy specification analysis. Such<br\/>correctness analysis must be automated such that the security configuration of a network system can be<br\/>adaptive to changes, faults\/intrusions, and mobility. On the other hand, if there are inherent constraints<br\/>and conflicts among the existing security policies such that it is impossible to have a consistent policy set,<br\/>the policy analysis engine should also automatically determine the impossibility.<br\/>Inter-domain Secure Policy Distribution<br\/>The proposed work under the first issue assumes that we have a perfect and centralized collection of<br\/>information related to the policies and security requirements around the whole Internet. However, in reality,<br\/>this might not always be possible as Internet is owned and managed by different administrative domains,<br\/>while, for trust and privacy consideration, information regarding local policy and network topology might<br\/>not be sharable across domain boundaries.<br\/>The second objective of this proposed research is, under some inter-domain related constraints, to develop a<br\/>collaborative framework\/architecture and a suite of distributed protocols such that we can still analyze the<br\/>correctness of a set of decentralized IPSec\/VPN policies. We will study the issue of the minimum amount<br\/>of policy information needed for a particular policy domain to determine whether its local policies and<br\/>requirements will be consistent with other domains. Once the set of policies is decided, a policy distribution<br\/>mechanism is also needed.<br\/>Under this proposed research project, we will first focus on the theoretical aspect of policy and requirement<br\/>specifications and their analysis. We will develop algorithms and analytical results to fundamental enhance<br\/>our current technology in policy-driven networking systems such as IPSec\/VPN. Second, we plan on<br\/>implementing a prototype to validate and evaluate our proposed approach on a realistic networking<br\/>environment. The first phase will be a small testbed to run the prototype software, which will be open<br\/>sourced and available to the community. Furthermore, we would like to collaborate with industry partners<br\/>such as equipment venders and ISPs to further evaluate and validate our approach against real-world<br\/>challenges. Furthermore, we will pay special attention to the application of our solutions in a mobile<br\/>network environment. In such environment, the capability of dynamically updating IPSec security policy is<br\/>extremely critical. To summarize, we will not only deliver academic publications about our proposed works<br\/>but also produce a prototype system and perform extensive experiments, including the real-world data set if<br\/>possible, to evaluate the performance and accuracy and to validate our theoretical model in handling<br\/>difficulty issues in Policy-driven networking systems.","title":"ITR\/SI: Automatic Consistency Checking for IPSec\/VPN Security Policy","awardID":"0113388","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2004-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["507838"],"PO":["250082"]},"65327":{"abstract":"The proposal is a collaborative proposal involving University of Pittsburgh & Case Western Reserve University.

The problem is tecnologically challenging because the channel that connects the basestation to the peripherals is random and time-varying. The most general solution requires space-time coding and signal processing that is \"matched\" to the channel. The objective of this research program is to extend the theory of space-time array processing (STAP) developed for radar applications, to multi-antenna wireless communication over fading channnels, in order to determine when<br\/>and how channel structure can be exploited for space-time signal processing gain and\/or diversity. Theoretically, the results of this research advance the understanding of multi-antenna wireless communication between antenna arrays. Practically, they suggest methods for adaptively communicating between fixed basestations and mobiles and between fixed computers and movable storage area networks.<br\/><br\/>Prior results by the principal investigators suggest that only the span of a low-dimensional channel subspace, and not the detailed physics of its coordinate representation, is required for the design of signals that optimize transmit diversity, and tranceivers that optimize the trade off between space-time processing gain and diversity. Moreover, the optimum transceiver statistics are just estimators of output signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR), suggesting that transceiver statistics for decoding data can be used to estimate and track output SINR and network capacity. This means power and bandwidth may be adaptively allocated, using only transceiver statistics. So, in broad outline, this program is addressed to space-time channel modelling, using subspace methods; subspace signal and transceiver design for gain and diversity; and estimation of network capacity, using only transceiver statistics.","title":"ITR\/SY + SI (C-CR) Collaborative Research: Signal Processing and Channel Modelling in Low-Dimensional Subspaces for Wireless Communication in Multi-Antenna Systems","awardID":"0112573","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2004-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4720","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING SYS PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["523725"],"PO":["564898"]},"64800":{"abstract":"Computing services in the future should become just as available and easy to use as any of the modern<br\/>utilities: power, water, or telephone service. A compute utility should work reliably and invisibly,<br\/>providing users with simple, efficient access to their data and individualized computing environments<br\/>anywhere in the world. Data kept in the utility may be private, publicly available, or shared between<br\/>designated parties.<br\/> Our proposed compute utility architecture is based on the idea of a compute capsule, which captures<br\/>the entire logical state of an active computing environment. A capsule is portable, persistent,<br\/>host-independent, self-contained and can be suspended on disk, arbitrarily bound to different machines,<br\/>and transparently resumed. Compute servers in a utility run a small trusted computing base, which<br\/>manages the compute capsules like a cache. Users' capsules can be run on any of the compute servers in<br\/>the utility and are typically run on local machines for enhanced interactive performance. Capsules provide<br\/>users with customizabililty as well as a guarantee of isolation from other users. As persistent objects that<br\/>can be shared, duplicated and version-controlled, capsules can be easily managed and administered.<br\/> The compute utility model has significant advantages over our current environment. First, instead of<br\/>requiring end users to procure, administer and upgrade their equipment individually, resources of a utility<br\/>are shared and managed centrally by experts, thus resulting in a more efficient system. Second, a global<br\/>utility allows users efficient access to their computing environment everywhere. They need not juggle a<br\/>large number of different interfaces and deal with the discontinuities as they move between home and work<br\/>every day. Third, a professionally managed compute utility designed to support global mobility and<br\/>sharing can provide greater security than our current environment. In contrast, today novice users are<br\/>responsible for keeping their systems secure, and the lack of adequate support for sharing and mobility<br\/>leads to practices that jeopardize security. Fourth, the infrastructure of a utility serves as an excellent<br\/>platform for several emerging computing trends: software hosted remotely by application service<br\/>providers, support of ubiquitous access devices, and large-scale distributed computing.<br\/> The goal of this research project is to investigate the viability of a compute utility and to lay the<br\/>technical foundation for such an infrastructure. The techniques developed can also be applied to manage an<br\/>institution's distributed resources.<br\/> First, we will investigate the concept of capsules fully by studying their design and applications.<br\/>Capsules can be implemented at the machine, operating system and application level; trade-offs between<br\/>these different approaches will be studied. We will also explore novel uses of capsules: capsules can be<br\/>used to run untrusted software; they can provide secure and shared environments for group projects;<br\/>capsules can also serve as pre-installed software packages ready to run on any machine. We will develop<br\/>the associated tools to make capsuleseasy to use.<br\/> Second, we will develop the technologies to ensure security in a compute utility. Security will be<br\/>provided at three levels: a small trusted kernel that provides isolation between capsules and monitors<br\/>capsules for added security; the use of certified capsules to create trusted computing environments; data<br\/>security will be provided by encryption, and sharing will be supported by a flexible key management<br\/>scheme. We plan to conduct a careful analysis of the vulnerabilities of the system.<br\/> Third, this research will produce the technologies useful for creating scalable, efficient, and easily<br\/>maintainable compute utilities. They include techniques for managing machines in a globally distributed<br\/>environment by treating them as caches of capsules, and techniques that combine capsule caching and<br\/>remote display technology to support global mobility and sharing.<br\/> This research will develop a prototype compute utility to validate the technology developed. To make<br\/>extensive experimentation possible, the prototype will support legacy software. The experiments will be<br\/>designed especially to address the information technology needs of universities.<br\/> Computer systems have gone through two major eras, time-sharing on mainframes and personal<br\/>computing.

In fact, most of the future wireless communication<br\/>systems will be using CDMA technology. Yet, as far as reaching the great potential of CDMA in terms<br\/>of higher system capacity, lower bit error rate, and lower packet loss rate, the problem of demodulation in<br\/>the presence of multiple access interference remains as a significant bottleneck for all CDMA systems.<br\/>To solve this multiple access interference problem, researchers and engineers have worked since the early<br\/>1980's on so-called multiuser detectors (MUD). Unfortunately, thus far none of the multiuser detectors<br\/>has been implemented in a real CDMA system, because of the prohibitive complexity of these structures.<br\/> There are two major factors that contribute to this situation. First, CDMA systems must use long<br\/>spreading sequences for several practical reasons, whereas multiuser detectors must use short spreading<br\/>sequences. Second, the complexity of even the simplest multiuser detector is still too great to be<br\/>implemented in the fastest electronics, for all but the smallest of data rates. In this work, we propose to<br\/>address both of these problems in a collaborative effort. The collaboration will be organized so that Dr.<br\/>Qingchong Liu of Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, will initially focus on the first objective,<br\/>and Dr. David W. Matolak of Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, will initially (and concurrently) focus on<br\/>the second objective. Results will be exchanged frequently, and meetings will be held quarterly. After<br\/>some early progress, our collaboration will grow closer as we combine the work objectives and consider<br\/>system (transmitter and receiver) performance.<br\/> We propose first to extend some recent results obtained for the construction of long spreading<br\/>sequences from short sequences. This can be termed the system objective. These new sequences will<br\/>be appropriate for both conventional CDMA systems and for multiuser detectors. This method was<br\/>invented by one of us and has been implemented in possibly the fastest wireless network running at<br\/>400Mbps in the Spaceway system by Hughes Electronics. It has significantly reduced receiver<br\/>complexity and cost, and gives essentially optimum performance. By measuring sequence correlations at<br\/>multiple levels, the method provides new insights on sequence design and tremendously reduces<br\/>complexity in signal design and detection for broadband wireless communications. This method has the<br\/>potential to help bridge a gap between current CDMA systems and multiuser detectors.<br\/> We also propose to study reduced complexity multiuser receivers from the perspective of reduced<br\/>complexity trellis search techniques, combined with one of the most promising MUD receiver structures,<br\/>in a partitioned manner. This can be termed the receiver objective. The MUD receiver of interest is<br\/>the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) receiver, which is attractive for its good performance and<br\/>modest complexity. The partitioning approach will aim to share the detection tasks between the MMSE<br\/>front-end and the reduced-complexity trellis processor. These receivers will make use of the new<br\/>spreading sequences specified for use in future 3 rd and 4 th -generation CDMA wireless communication<br\/>system standards, and the multiple level sequences developed in the system objective. The reduced<br\/>complexity trellis search techniques will explore use of the analogous techniques researched for<br\/>equalization, but not fully applied to the problem of CDMA multiuser detection. Our goal for these two<br\/>objectives is to create a fundamental bridge to connect the existing and planned CDMA systems with the<br\/>theoretical multiuser detectors so that the bottleneck of the multiple access interference problem in<br\/>CDMA systems can be surmounted.<br\/> Both objectives of this proposed work will employ analysis, followed by computer simulations.<br\/>Both objectives will also require the assistance of graduate and undergraduate students. The modeling<br\/>work will aim to reconcile theory with practical implementation and thus provide engineering education<br\/>in the best sense: connecting principles and practice. Training students in both system design and<br\/>receiver design for CDMA will also naturally be valuable to the wireless industry. In addition, the<br\/>research will provide material for inclusion in several new graduate courses, and in undergraduate design<br\/>projects, at both universities.","title":"ITR\/SI Collaborative Research: Investigations on CDMA Systems using Multiple Level Sequences and Partitioned Reduced Complexity Multiuser Detection Receivers","awardID":"0112722","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2005-06-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["533504"],"PO":["250082"]},"75602":{"abstract":"Proposal Number: ITR-0081316<br\/>PI: Xi, Hongwei<br\/>Institution: West Campus, University of Cincinnati<br\/>TITLE: Imperative Programming with Dependent Types<br\/><br\/>Programming is notoriously error-prone.

The specific application that will drive this research and provide a test platform for it is the trigger and data acquisition system for BTeV, an accelerator-based High Energy Physics (HEP) experiment to study matter-antimatter asymmetries (also known as Charge-Parity violation) in the decays of particles containing the b-quark. BTeV has been approved by Fermilab management and is expected to be constructed over the next 5-6 years to run in conjunction with the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The data-taking phase of the experiment is expected to be at least five years. It requires a massively parallel, heterogeneous cluster of computing elements to reconstruct 15 million particle interactions (events) per second and to use the reconstruction data to decide which events to retain for further data analysis. <br\/><br\/>Creating usable software for this type of real-time embedded system will require research into solutions of general problems in the fields of computer science and engineering.

The systems must be dynamically reconfigurable to allow maximum performance from the available and potentially changing resources. The systems must be highly available, since the environments produce the data streams continuously over a long period of time, and interesting phenomena important to the analysis are rare and could occur at any time. To achieve the high availability, the systems must be fault tolerant, self-aware, and fault adaptive, since any malfunction of processing elements, the interconnection switches, or the front-end sensors (which provide the input stream) can result in an unrecoverable loss of data. Faults must be corrected in the shortest possible time, and corrected semi-autonomously (i.e., with as little human intervention as possible).

As a concrete example, the size of Genbank, a nucleotide database, has been doubling every 14 months and is currently 33 GB. In the commercial arena attention has turned to information and its location also. More and more network services, fueled by the demands of information-intensive Web applications, are shifting the focus in computer systems to I\/O.<br\/><br\/>With the growing importance of data comes the need to address its management.

This operation is sequential and processor-centric; the emphasis is on moving the data to the processor rather than a computation to the data. Instead, we propose to associate a \"search for word\" command with the dictionary in the form of a new I\/O interface.

However, most of the current successes are based on safe-languages such as Java. While this safe-language approach provides a satisfactory solution for many applications, it has inherent limitations, especially for technical computing applications which use legacy code such as C, Fortran, or C++. And since most technical computing and applications use these \"legacy\" systems, they will not be able to take advantage of the work that has been done on safe-languages such as Java.<br\/>The proposal plans to develop the High Performance Computing Mobility (HPCM) middleware, which will increase the mobility of legacy codes written in C, Fortran or C++. HPCM consists of different components including middleware interface, pre-compiler system, run-time libraries and so forth. HPCM can also be used as a low-level layer under Java to support mobility of local native codes. HPCM can support complex data strutures, heterogenous netework evnironments, and scalable parallel computing. HPCM is designed to increase the mobility while maintaining the high performance of legacy codes.<br\/>There are a number of research questions which the proposal plans to address, and, the success of HPCM will benefit many on-going and future research projects.","title":"Mobility of Legacy Code","awardID":"0123930","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2006-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4089","name":"NETWORK CENTRIC MIDDLEWARE SVC"}}],"PIcoPI":["557489"],"PO":["7594"]},"62964":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>PI Jansen - #0113654<br\/>PI Moret - #0113095<br\/><br\/>This award provides support for a collaborative project between two biologists (Jansen and Boore) and three computer scientists (Moret, Warnow, and Bader) to develop and test new algorithms and software for constructing evolutionary trees (phylogenies) from the rapidly increasing amount of genomic data. The estimation of phylogenies is crucial to a wide range of basic and applied biological problems such as the epidemiology of AIDS, the identification of viral agents, the analysis of protein structure and function, the prediction of RNA structure; and, of course, it is the basic tool for inferring evolutionary history. Methods for the reconstruction of phylogenies are most commonly applied to DNA sequences. In many cases these sequences change at rates that are too low or too high for recovering accurate evolutionary trees. One new type data that is fast gaining favor in the biology community is gene order and content within whole genomes, but so far very few computational methods have been developed for these types of data. <br\/><br\/>The three goals of the project are to: (1) develop algorithms and software for reconstructing evolutionary trees from gene order and content data; (2) assess the performance of these algorithms through extensive simulation studies under parameter-rich models of genome evolution and through application to real datasets; and (3) develop high-performance implementations of the best algorithms designed in the project using algorithm engineering techniques and a flexible approach to parallelization.

Of the 2.5 million or more adult Americans with significant disability due to chronic neurologic impairment, a large percentage present with dysarthria, or speech impairment, as one of their disabling conditions, and there are no known cures. Dysarthric individuals report loss of employment, educational opportunities, social integration, and quality of life. Despite some strategies for compensating, the isolation caused by communication impairment is pervasive. In this project, the PI will develop new algorithms that, when implemented in wearable devices, will enable dysarthric individuals to be more easily understood. Currently available devices are essentially (digital or analog) spectral filters and amplifiers that enhance certain parts of the spectrum. While these can help certain types of dysarthria, many dysarthric persons suffer from speech problems that require forms of speech modification that are much more profound and complex such as: irregular sub-glottal pressure, resulting in loudness bursts that can be difficult to adjust to; absence, or poor control, of voicing; systematic mispronunciation of certain phoneme groups, resulting in certain sounds becoming indistinguishable or unrecognizable; variable mispronunciation; and poor prosody (pitch control, timing, and loudness). For these difficult problems, new approaches are needed that do not merely filter the speech signal but analyze it at acoustic, articulatory, phonetic, and linguistic levels. These approaches can be combined to generate an output speech signal that, while preserving certain features of the input speech, modifies the input speech along as many dimensions as is needed to achieve intelligibility. The past decade has seen a revolution in speech technology that can be applied to these problems; while little of the currently developed technologies are in their present form applicable to dysarthria, the underlying algorithms can form a basis for the creation of innovative techniques that are specifically targeted to address these more difficult speech problems. The PI will create these technologies in a diagnostic framework, so that the appropriate technology is used for a given type of dysarthria. The results will be of great value for dysarthric individuals; the scientific challenges are formidable, and meeting them will produce insights that will be broadly useful for other speech technologies as well.","title":"Making Dysarthric Speech Intelligible","awardID":"0117911","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2005-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6845","name":"HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["409042","483791"],"PO":["565227"]},"63922":{"abstract":"0116921<br\/><br\/>Phillips\/UIUC<br\/><br\/>The aim of this project is to study the role of mixing and vorticity <br\/>generated by breaking waves on the formation and evolution of Langmuir <br\/>circulations in the oceanic surface mixed layer.

Our goal is to develop a clear plan for integration of LAN's and MAN's in order to improve the degree to which the benefits of high bandwidth in the MAN's are delivered to end users on the LAN's. The application of architectural techniques to this problem cannot be effectively pursued without understanding the capabilities of proposed and available devices, yet the needs of architecture should strongly guide device development to ensure usefulness and relevance. To address these issues, we have formed a synergistic partnership between network architecture and hardware technology groups.<br\/> At the architectural level, we will explore issues in the design and evaluation of robust optical LAN architectures with explicit focus on the means of access to MAN's and on the capabilities necessary for both LAN nodes and the MAN-LAN interfaces (MLI's). The MLI's will serve as both hub and head-end for the LAN and will provide a simple interface between the LAN and the MAN. We will explore the robustness of these architectures to faults and will quantify the benefits of exploiting wavelength conversion and tunable sources to improve a network's robustness to failures with a range of automatic protection algorithms. Using wavelength conversion at MLI's, we will study the impact of wavelength conversion on robustness and network routing. Using wavelength conversion to enhance robustness has received very little attention, whereas routing is the focus of substantial previous work. We will also explore the effectiveness of optically transparent paths as limited by noise and insertion loss in the devices, and will study the tradeoffs between network capacity and robustness given these routing limitations.<br\/> At the device level, we will explore devices and subsystems that trade some functionality for increased simplicity or improved cost-effectiveness. The first of these elements is a multi-cavity VCSEL, which exploits the underlying physics to produce wavelength-tunable transmitters at a fraction of the cost of current tunable sources. These VC-SEL's will fill the gap between inexpensive, non-tunable VCSEL's available in a small range of wavelengths, and high-end, carrier-grade lasers. Our proposed tunable VCSEL's are intended to fulfill the requirements of MAN\/LAN environments, which are a hybrid of current core networks and current LAN's.<br\/> We also plan to develop optical wavelength converters based on dual-pump, four-wave mixing. The dual-pump design enhances both the efficiency and the range of the converter, and can also provide polarization independence. High efficiency is necessary to reduce or to eliminate the need for regeneration of optical signals within the MAN-LAN environment. Only a single wavelength enters the wavelength converter, thus the filter eliminates the effects of coherent and incoherent crosstalk between wavelengths that arises through four-wave mixing. SOA-based wavelength conversion is typically cheaper than other approaches, but suffers from poorer noise figures stemming from the use of the SOA, which make them less attractive for long-distance applications in core networks. For the MAN-LAN environment, SOA's present an attractive and economical alternative that allows ubiquitous availability of wavelength converters at switching nodes.<br\/>Third, we will develop high-speed photodetectors based on indium-phosphide materials. The development of<br\/>high-speed photodetectors helps to maintain fairly lean wavelength requirements in local and metropolitan areas, avoiding the challenges of dense WDM. While more aggressive scalability is attractive in many ways, a single 80 Gbps wavelength can move a terabyte of data in less than two minutes. A single wavelength with effective access mecha-nisms can be used as a virtual private network if appropriately deployed over a LAN\/MAN infrastructure.<br\/> Finally, we propose to develop tunable 2x2 switch elements based on indium phosphide ring resonators. Such devices allow a single wavelength to be selected and exchanged by the switch while all other wavelengths pass through untouched. These switches serve as building blocks for several important components, including tunable receivers and low insertion loss, low-crosstalk, high-speed optical crossconnects.<br\/> The development of these network elements will guide the types of systems that the network architecture group examines. At the same time, results from the network architecture group in terms of maximum system gain for a given approach (i.e., wavelength conversion, add-drop capability) will influence the direction of the hardware technology development. We believe that this approach is the best method for optimizing the architecture of next-generation fiber-optic WDM systems within the framework of the network element technology.<br\/> The researc","title":"ITR\/SY: High-Speed Wavelength-Agile Optical Networks","awardID":"0121662","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2007-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["180543","253766","557162","375361"],"PO":["565090"]},"64715":{"abstract":"Collaborative Research: ITR\/AP&IM Data Intense Challenge: <br\/>The Instrumented Oil Field of the Future<br\/><br\/>Mary Wheeler - University of Texas at Austin - 0121523<br\/>Alan Sussman - University of Maryland, College Park - 0121161<br\/>Joel Saltz - Ohio State University Research Foundation - 0121177<br\/>Manish Parashar - Rutgers University - 0120934<br\/><br\/><br\/>Increasing production from existing oil and natural gas reservoirs is crucial for the US economy.

The problem is tecnologically challenging because the channel that connects the basestation to the peripherals is random and time-varying. The most general solution requires space-time coding and signal processing that is \"matched\" to the channel. The objective of this research program is to extend the theory of space-time array processing (STAP) developed for radar applications, to multi-antenna wireless communication over fading channnels, in order to determine when and how channel structure can be exploited for space-time signal processing gain and\/or diversity. Theoretically, the results of this research advance the understanding of multi-antenna wireless communication between antenna arrays. Practically, they suggest methods for adaptively communicating between fixed basestations and mobiles and between fixed computers and movable storage area networks.<br\/><br\/>Prior results by the principal investigators suggest that only the span of a low-dimensional channel subspace, and not the detailed physics of its coordinate representation, is required for the design of signals that optimize transmit diversity, and tranceivers that optimize the trade off between space-time processing gain and diversity. Moreover, the optimum transceiver statistics are just estimators of output signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR), suggesting that transceiver statistics for decoding data can be used to estimate and track output SINR and network capacity. This means power and bandwidth may be adaptively allocated, using only transceiver statistics. So, in broad outline, this program is addressed to space-time channel modelling, using subspace methods; subspace signal and transceiver design for gain and diversity; and estimation of network capacity, using only transceiver statistics.","title":"ITR\/SY+SI (C-CR) Collaborative Research: Signal Processing and Channel Modelling in Low-Dimensional Subspaces for Wireless Communication in Multi-Antenna Systems","awardID":"0112508","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2005-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["345777"],"PO":["564898"]},"64816":{"abstract":"This is a research project in the design and implementation of novel Human Computer Interfaces for educational use in structural molecular biology.

The goal of this research project is to develop defensive techniques to counter denial-of-information (DoI) attacks. Such attacks attempt to confuse an information system by deliberately introducing noise that appears to be useful information. The mere availability of information is insufficient if the user must find a needle in a haystack of noise that is created by an adversary to hide critical information. The research focuses on the characterization of information quality metrics that are relevant in the presence of DoI attacks. In particular, two complementary metrics are explored. Information regularity captures predictability in the patterns of information creation and access. The second metric, information quality trust, captures the known ability of an information source to meet the needs of its clients. The development of techniques to derive the values of these metrics for information sources is a key goal of the research. Other planned research activities include the building of a distributed information infrastructure and experimental evaluation of defensive techniques against DoI attacks.","title":"ITR\/SI: Guarding the Next Internet Frontier: Countering Denial of Information","awardID":"0121643","effectiveDate":"2001-10-01","expirationDate":"2008-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7371","name":"CYBER TRUST"}}],"PIcoPI":["549757",167498,"532971","278821","521101"],"PO":["564898"]}}
