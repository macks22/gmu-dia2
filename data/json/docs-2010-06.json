{"163780":{"abstract":"Detection, identification, and tracking of CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive) plumes can be accomplished by combining the modalities of sensor and cyber networks. The sensor network provides information about physical-space activities, e.g., locations and movements of the plume sources. The cyber network provides storage and computational resources to analyze and infer where the plume originated, the trajectory of its movement, and the prediction of its future movement. The challenges in realizing such a sensor cyber network include intelligent sensing (intelligent sensor selection and coverage) and the capability to deal with uncertainties (uncertainty in measurement as well as in modeling). This project proposes to leverage the convergence between the sensor and the cyber networks to achieve these goals. In particular, the plan is to carry out three synergistic research tasks: 1) network formation by sensor selection, placement, and coverage; 2) sensor tasking protocol with temporal\/spatial uncertainty management; 3) protocols for reliable sensor-cyber communication supporting the above two tasks. The PIs will prototype the research results and integrate the prototypes for different components to build the sensor cyber network for plume detection, identification and tracking. They will also evaluate the sensor cyber network using various test scenarios in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Lab. If successful, the project will provide technology for building detection and tracking sensor networks that can give great protection to people and the environment against harmful plumes.","title":"NeTS: Medium: Collaborative Research: Building an Intelligent, Uncertainty-Resilient Detection and Tracking Sensor Network","awardID":"0964086","effectiveDate":"2010-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["438434","550639",438434],"PO":["565303"]},"163692":{"abstract":"Traditional security authorization decisions are black and white: a user either satisfies a particular access policy or does not. This rigidity is a handicap in our complex and unpredictable world. As a result, even security-conscious organizations typically grossly overprovision principals with access rights and\/or underconstrain access policies to ensure that principals can always carry out the organization's mission effectively and respond to unexpected opportunities and challenges. This project focuses on developing dynamic and risk-aware approaches to access control that allow organizations to make security-critical decisions in the face of incomplete information and unexpected circumstances. This is accomplished by combining proof-theoretic access controls with economic models of risk. In the event that the expected proof of authorization for an action cannot be generated, the systems developed in this project carry out an efficient search for similar proofs of authorization that minimize the overall risk incurred by deviating from the expected. This approach allows policies to adapt dynamically to the changing context of the systems in which they are deployed. This research will have several benefits, including increased system availability during disasters or other uncommon cases not explicitly modeled by policies; reduced instances of permission creep, as overprovisioning users is no longer required to ensure that an organization's business needs are met; a quantifiable means of assessing how policies are actually used and how they might be changed to better reflect the evolution of organizations; and the development of metrics for assessing access control risks.","title":"TC:Medium: Collaborative Research: Towards Formal, Risk Aware Authorization","awardID":"0963715","effectiveDate":"2010-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"8060","name":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace"}}],"PIcoPI":["438434","438434","548254"],"PO":["565264"]},"164495":{"abstract":"The objective of this project is to develop in-depth understanding of the nature, underlying models, and dynamics of Social Network Services (SNS) with millions and even billions of users.

An organizationally-adept agent is not only aware of its role(s) in an organization, but can also monitor how well it is fulfilling its organizational responsibilities and can proactively adapt its behaviors to meet organizational needs better. Organizationally adept agents evaluate their behaviors based not on their (agent-centric) self-interests but rather on their (organization-centric) responsibilities to each other, and autonomously adapt to achieve organizational objectives emergently. <br\/><br\/>Elaboration and adaptation by organizationally adept agents means that the ultimate organization design is formed by a combination of top-down design (to produce a \"ballpark\" organization) and emergent refinement processes. Further, this combination can be iterative and ongoing, where organizationally adept agents can detect tension between top-down and emergent influences, and inform the design processes of runtime interaction patterns and environmental tendencies that suggest useful top-down organization restructurings. <br\/><br\/>The intellectual problems being pursued are central to practical issues in scaling multi-agent systems to help solve complex, long-term, global problems. Many critical challenges facing society including climate change, health care, and sustainable energy|require a prolonged commitment to monitoring and managing distributed activities. Networked computer systems populated by software agents, which can be constantly measuring, comparing, and interpreting information to understand and respond to wide-scale phenomena, promise to address such challenges, but need the kinds of innovations proposed in this project.

There is a particular focus on identifying what empirical studies could shed light on some of the most contentious issues in copyright policy. Copyright directly impacts a broader range of industries than patents -- publishing, recording, films, games, and software among others -- as well as virtually all activity on the Internet.<br\/><br\/>Four sets of outcomes are generated. The first is a set of commissioned papers on topics including a review of existing literature, an estimation and categorization of the scope of economic activity affected by copyright and its exception, a theoretical analysis of how copyright may stimulate or inhibit innovation, and at least one case study of the role of copyright and digital media in an industry undergoing disruptive change. The second is a public workshop on the topic of the impact of copyright policy on innovation. The third is the development of an online discussion forum. The final is a peer-reviewed report with recommendations for public and private funding agencies and institutions. <br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: In contrast to scholarship on some other elements of the innovation system, theoretical analysis of and empirical research on the impact of copyright policy has been very limited. Research in the area is urgently needed, since copyright policy affects a large and diverse range of economic activity. <br\/><br\/>It is critically important that we learn more, since the rules of copyright evolved for the most part in a pre-1990 era when the number of authors and publishers was small relative to the entire population, each instance of a creative work had a physical manifestation, the uses to which works could be put were known and relatively narrow, collaboration to produce a work generally required physical co-location or the repeated exchange of physical objects, and infringing copies were somewhat difficult to produce and distribute. As a result of the Internet, the number of authors approaches the size of the population, most works exist in non-physical form as a collection of bits, works can be readily excerpted, altered, and combined in limitless variety, reproduction and distribution are essentially cost-free, and collaboration can occur on a vast scale across differences of time and location.<br\/><br\/>The project stimulates such research by convening a community of interested scholars and potential funders to evaluate recent and ongoing work, identify policy relevant topics for future research, and explore the potential for developing new datasources, such as the creation of a new litigation database, and new methods. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts : The approach should stimulate the emergence of a multi-disciplinary community of scholars. A similar effort led to the growth of a community of patent scholars who are now very active participants in the patent reform debate.

This unified approach brings together fields of Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Bioengineering to create an instrument for precisely measuring and visualizing significant information and results across the five dimensions, three from spatial data, time, and an imaging modality that serves as the fifth dimension. Accomplishing this mission involves advanced designs, hardware-software integration mechanisms, and novel interfaces that bring competing, and sometimes diverging, technologies into a unified brain research platform. Combining a Multi-site Data Repository, Modality Integration and Computational, Visualization, and Operation Support Units, this new instrument is expected to bring:<br\/>- New insights into brain structure, functional correlations and dynamics, both in its normal state and under specific pathological conditions,<br\/>- Far improved mapping of patterns of brain activity,<br\/>- Integration of multimodal technologies in order to augment their capabilities with new insights while consolidating high spatial resolution with high temporal resolution,<br\/>- Database design and management augmented with mechanisms for fast user interaction and visualization to meet the challenge of managing complex spatio-temporal datasets, posing complex queries, and establishing effective methods for data representation and visualization, and<br\/>- Resolution of those paradigms that confront heavy computational requirements and compatibility problems that arise from the use of different recording modalities and diverse software platforms.<br\/>The project aims to collectively overcome the primary barriers in identifying the different factors that influence the functional organization of the brain and its underlying pathology. As an example, it delves in the epileptic seizure that can be mapped over time as it moves along specific fiber tracts that may enable better identification of specific areas of treatment and consequently protect functionally important parts of the brain during surgery that may lead to better and safer outcomes.<br\/>Broader Impacts: <br\/>Fostering an environment that supports cross disciplinary initiatives, joint collaboration and programs, the instrument establishes a research platform that enables academic institutions and hospitals to investigate multi-site collaborative studies in accordance to systematically administered standardize protocols to a database of common assessments and measures.

The research addresses integrated payments for trains, subways, buses, ferries, and recharging of electric cars, as well as toll collection for roads, bridges, and tunnels. Multi-disciplinary aspects include novel cryptographic protocols and lightweight implementations of privacy-preserving payment systems. Challenges include providing security and privacy in a low-cost, usable, and reliable manner. Payments for transportation differ significantly from general-purpose e-commerce in terms of both security and engineering constraints. For instance, transportation operators wish to observe user behavior to improve the overall performance of the system---seemingly contradicting privacy. Moreover, payment devices must be extremely cheap, mass produced, and tolerant of a wide range of passenger demands.<br\/>The expected results and activities include: (1) design of novel cryptographic algorithms achieving privacy at low cost while retaining the benefits of meaningful data collection for ITPS; (2) implementation of hardware and software to perform modern cryptographic operations on low-cost devices; and (3) testing of human factors and performance under realistic conditions that must balance security and privacy with cost and usability. The broader impacts are extensive as transportation systems are a critical part of most aspects of society, from the economy, to defense, to public safety. Moreover, information gathered from ITPS applications can facilitate advanced traffic management, travel time estimation, emergency management, congestion pricing, carbon emissions control, and environmental justice assessments.

This shared campus research instrument leverages an existing small-scale cluster without GPUs at UMass-Dartmouth resulting in a combined system of more than four times the size. <br\/>Specifically, the proposed cluster contains 32 8-way nodes (256 cores) plus one NVIDIA Tesla GPU per node for a total of 32 GPUs. The cluster is not intended to be a general computing resource, but rather highly specialized instrument necessary for the development of high-performance algorithms for scientific computation by the group of researchers in the proposal. Researchers will take advantage of the incorporation of the GPUs in each node to develop hybrid parallel and many-core-architecture-based computing. The investigators will abstract out these GPU-accelerated solvers into an open source GPU Scientific Library (GPUSL), which will be cleanly separated from the overlying simulation codes through a set of well-defined interfaces. <br\/>Faculty members from the Physics, Mathematics, Marine Science and Civil Engineering departments at UMass-Dartmouth have formed a scientific computing group that will become the core management and user group of the shared computational resources. The research foci of the group range from Evolution of Giant Molecular Clouds (using the FLASH code) to Coastal Ocean Modeling (using the FVCOM code) to the Simulation of an Incompressible Turbulent Convective Fluid. Activities of this group include research collaborations, weekly team meetings for the sharing of expertise on numerical algorithms, co-advising of students, and a development of a multi-disciplinary doctoral program. <br\/>The cluster will be housed in the Campus Information Technology Services (CITS) data center at UMass-Dartmouth, and directly supported by the CITS Enterprise Systems Administration Team. This team will be responsible for preventive maintenance session backup and recovery of user disk space. The access to the machine and its allocation will be handled by a Research User Group Committee which will be responsible for soliciting proposals from faculty members seeking computer time and will also be responsible for balancing the research needs of the faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students in the user base.<br\/>Broader Impacts: <br\/>The availability of this cluster allows for the training of the next generation of high performance computing experts, and supports a new interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in computational science, currently in development. Graduate students benefit from the opportunity to develop cutting-edge parallel and GPU-accelerated algorithms for a variety of challenging physical problems, in a multi-disciplinary setting. The cluster also directly benefits undergraduate education, as part of the NSF-funded Computational Science for Undergraduate Mathematics Students (CSUMS) project, which aims to prepare undergraduate students for, and engage them in, a sustained research experience in computational mathematics. The approach is to recruit promising high school seniors, then guide freshman and sophomores students through research topics in computational science, and culminate by mentoring seniors through carefully selected research projects.<br\/>In addition, UMass-Dartmouth has a successful tradition of broadening higher-education access to underrepresented students through its College Now Steps Toward Abstract Reasoning and Thinking (START) program. Over its 40-year history, the program has played a significant role in broadening STEM access to disadvantaged students to women and underrepresented minorities; in particular, approximately 25% - 30% of START students in recent semesters are underrepresented minority persons of color. For the scientific community, all computer codes developed on this enabling cluster, including the GPU Software Library, will be released via a dedicated website, immediately impacting more than 2500 researchers worldwide who use the community codes FLASH and FVCOM.","title":"MRI-R2 : Acquisition of a Heterogenous Terascale Shared Campus Computing Facility","awardID":"0959382","effectiveDate":"2010-06-01","expirationDate":"2011-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1189","name":"MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["463149","542646","190556","556162","474415"],"PO":["557609"]},"162663":{"abstract":"Natural language processing, information extraction, information<br\/>integration and other text processing solutions are central components<br\/>of computer science, and key tools for addressing the ever-increasing<br\/>problems in information overload.

Development of a high level software infrastructure to allow optimization of I\/O for entire workflows (including High-Performance I\/O when reading data with different patterns) would greatly improve end-to-end performance in the knowledge discovery cycle. <br\/>This project plans to develop efficient I\/O methods which will enable application scientists to optimize data for writing, and which will be able to re-organize the data to obtain optimal performance for common reading patterns used by scientists. This project directly impacts the I\/O performance of many petascale applications, including the GTC, GTS, XGC-1, Chimera, and S3D codes, and work directly with these teams to optimize the I\/O in all stages of their scientific workflow.","title":"An Application Driven I\/O Optimization Approach for PetaScale Systems and Scientific Discoveries","awardID":"1003228","effectiveDate":"2010-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"7476","name":"ETF"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":["530745","540170"],"PO":["565272"]},"168967":{"abstract":"CNS - 1019343 <br\/>Abstract: <br\/><br\/>The nation's universities and industrial research labs are facing continuing budget pressure as part of the international financial crisis. The result is a significant shortage of computing research and teaching positions. Moreover, as our society faces challenges in energy, healthcare, education, and a host of other IT-reliant areas, the need for new talent grows. With fewer opportunities to obtain the intellectual renewal and diversity that promising new scholars can inject into institutions engaged in research and teaching, we risk creating a \"hole\" in the talent pool that will last for decades. This, in turn, puts at risk our nation's ability to use technological innovation for remaining globally competitive. Hundreds of our brightest and best-trained computing researchers are suddenly unable to find adequate opportunities to do advanced research and teach future generations. As a nation, we have invested time, energy, and funding in the training of these Ph.D.s. It is absolutely essential that we find ways to realize a payoff for that investment. <br\/><br\/>The Second NSF Computing Innovation Fellows (CIFellows) project will enable newly graduated computing Ph.D.s to obtain one-to-two year positions at academic institutions and industrial research organizations. It will support a new cohort of Fellows as well as second-year funding for many of the Fellows funded under the NSF Computing Innovation Fellows project last year. The aim is to forestall a permanent loss of research talent that is likely to occur if new Ph.D. graduates are forced to seek employment outside of the field due to the sharp cuts brought about by the continuing budget crisis. It will also allow new Ph.D.s to develop experience to make them more effective researchers and\/or teachers.","title":"The Second CI Fellows Project","awardID":"1019343","effectiveDate":"2010-06-01","expirationDate":"2015-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}}],"PIcoPI":["495935","241298","530092","209556"],"PO":["565264"]},"170991":{"abstract":"Leveraging Thought Leadership For Computational Thinking in the K-12 Curriculum<br\/>Phase II<br\/>Submitted by ISTE and CSTA<br\/>Project Summary<br\/>The Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) are seeking support from the National Science Foundation for Phase II of a project to develop common language surrounding computational thinking and strategies for integrating computational thinking within K-12 education. Project participants will articulate the challenges and opportunities for integrating computational thinking throughout K-12 education and create pathways for bringing computational thinking into the mainstream. This proposal provides evidence of the pressing need for consensus and unified effort around key definitions, concepts, and strategies for implementing computational thinking into K-12 classrooms.<br\/>In the first phase, we convened a small Steering Committee to plan the steps needed to accomplish our goal. Phase II of this project will include a meeting of thought leaders charged with building a shared understanding of computational thinking and prioritizing the strategies and resources that need to be developed to implement computational thinking in K-12 education. This will be followed by a workshop of practitioners and leaders who will begin drafting the resources required to bring about real and sustained changes to K-12 education. A Leadership Work Group will be responsible for taking the preliminary resources developed at the workshop and expand, enhance, and refine them for digital and print publication.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: Jeannette Wing published a germinal paper (Wing, 2006) where she posited that computational thinking encompasses a diverse set of skills that enable us to systematically and efficiently process information and solve complex problems. Grounded in the core activities of problem definition, abstractions, and solution development, Wing further argued that computational thinking could be directly applied, not just to computer science problems, but to the problems in virtually any discipline or field of human engagement. This project will seek to contribute to the advancement of computational thinking throughout K-12 education through the following strategies:<br\/>-Developing a better understanding of computational thinking through creating a shared working definition of \"computational thinking\" as it applies across disciplines K-12.<br\/>- Strengthen the teaching of computational thinking skills in K-12 education through supporting the development and dissemination of classroom resources such as model curriculum and assessments.<br\/>- Create broad scale dissemination of examples of computational thinking across the curriculum through working collaboratively with subject area specialists across the disciplines.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: The drive to embed computational thinking concepts across disciplines and subject areas will require the entire education community to grapple with core issues relating to developing precise and yet generalized definitions of concepts and practices. To achieve this, we must move beyond the limitations of our individual disciplines to a more cohesive and shared understanding of the ways in which computation underlies all problem definition and solution and improve our understanding of the ways in which computational thinking can enrich understanding and practice.<br\/>This project will therefore address the pressing need to create a more inclusive language to facilitate the identification and sharing of key concepts, challenges, strategies, and best practices and provide a mechanism for convening the larger community in the implementation of these powerful concepts and ideas across K-12 education.","title":"Leveraging Thought Leadership for Computational Thinking in the K-12 Curriculum--Phase II","awardID":"1030054","effectiveDate":"2010-06-01","expirationDate":"2011-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7640","name":"CPATH"}}],"PIcoPI":["463404",457775],"PO":["564181"]},"171673":{"abstract":"This project funds student travel for the ACM SIGMETRICS 2010 conference to be held at Columbia University in New York, on June 14-18, 2010.

As such, sensor networks are a key component of decision-making infrastructures. A critical issue in this context is the trustworthiness of the data being collected. Data integrity and quality decide the trustworthiness of data. Data integrity can be undermined not only because of errors by users, measurement devices and applications, but also because of malicious subjects who may inject inaccurate data with the goal of deceiving the data users. A fundamental tradeoff exists between data quality and the cost to gather and protect this data, e.g., in terms of sensor node energy. This project focuses on a multi-faceted solution to the problem of assessing integrity of data streams in sensor networks, taking into account cost and energy constraints. Key elements of the solution are: (a) a cyclic framework supporting the assessment of sensor data trustworthiness based on provenance, and sensor trustworthiness based on data that sensors provide; (b) strategies for continuously updating trust scores of sensor data and nodes; (c) a game-theoretic model to analyze and mitigate the risks due to active adversaries that try to undermine data integrity; (d) protocols for sensor network sleep\/wake scheduling and routing that balance the data quality and energy efficiency tradeoff. The project also includes the development of tools for assessing data trustworthiness, and experimental evaluation of the system performance.

The goals of this CAREER award are to: 1) improve the theoretical understanding of information privacy in the context of online social networks in an interdisciplinary manner; 2) assess the efficacy of various privacy intervention strategies developed or proposed by the technologists and regulators; and 3) develop and enhance the persuasiveness of privacy and security awareness and training programs. The main contribution of this research is the generation of an interdisciplinary privacy research framework, with extensive grounding in a range of multidisciplinary privacy literatures in behavioral sciences, computer science, information systems, communication, and social psychology. This research takes a holistic view of privacy compared to the large amount of work focusing strictly on data privacy aspects. Thus, it recognizes the critical importance of user perceptions and behaviors when evaluating and developing privacy protection approaches. The proposed three tasks are greatly needed to better connect the social analysis of user privacy behaviors with the technical design of privacy enhancing technologies. The work should contribute to basic science-the underpinnings of user perceptions and actions around privacy management-as well as the findings generated for informing the design of privacy enhancing techniques. The research findings can enable technology-oriented researchers to develop more feasible privacy enhancing techniques that are embedded into the design specifications of systems, as well as aligned with organizational practices and user behaviors. This project will adopt various empirical research methods (experiments, large-scale survey, focus group and social network analysis) to test the behavioral hypotheses underlying user privacy behaviors in the context of online social networks. Well executed surveys and field experiments will contribute substantially to our understanding of how the actual users of online social networks behave and what interventions (in terms of technologies, regulations and trainings) may change their privacy decisions and behaviors.<br\/><br\/>One of the three major research thrusts is to develop a privacy awareness and training program for users of online social networks. The findings could potentially have a large impact on promoting privacy and security awareness in the user community. The project also has impacts on guideline creation for industry regulators and government agencies. The PI aims to transform the repository of knowledge on the dynamic and dialectic nature of privacy assurance into a number of educational activities in her academic home at Penn State. The educational plan describes the development of new courses and course modules on privacy assurance at both undergraduate and graduate levels, bringing research into classrooms, outreach to students in underrepresented groups, and training of undergraduate and graduate student researchers in interdisciplinary methods. The PI has transformed her science into a privacy workshop for high-school girls and their parents to teach about on-line privacy issues and practices. She proposes to continue such efforts to promote privacy and security awareness among high-school girls, as well as to attract more female students into the program of security and risk analysis at Penn State. The PI will also work with a professional society, the Association for Information Systems, to create a privacy research chapter and a privacy pedagogy section to extend the Information Systems research agenda and curriculum into this important area nationally.","title":"CAREER: Examining Users' Collective Privacy Management for Online Social Networks","awardID":"0953749","effectiveDate":"2010-06-01","expirationDate":"2015-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"8060","name":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace"}}],"PIcoPI":["277956","550223"],"PO":["557315"]},"162631":{"abstract":"Software testing techniques are fundamental to the development of dependable software.

Current trends suggest that cores will be relatively simple, that on-chip memory will be partitioned into per-core caches, and that each cache will be relatively small. Furthermore, chips will continue to be pin-limited and therefore DRAM bandwidth won't scale with the number of cores.<br\/><br\/>Parallel software that is data intensive has the potential to run well on multicore processors due to the large total amount of on-chip cache, but requires effective use of the distributed on-chip caches. The dangers are that data used by many cores will be duplicated in many cores' caches, decreasing the total amount of distinct data that can be cached; and that some cores may incur DRAM loads trying to access more data than fits in their caches, while other cores have spare cache space.<br\/><br\/>As the number of cores per DRAM interface and the latencies between caches on a chip increase, it is important for software to manage the distributed caches well. A collaborative approach that involves architects and systems researchers to extend the memory interface to provide control over data placement and enable on-chip efficient data movement provides a holistic solution. Specifically, this work proposes data-movement control (DMC) interface, which includes support for cache-to-cache transfers, batching of several cache lines, sending a message to a core that is close to a cache that holds a particular data item, and data monitoring. The proposal also includes techniques to route data over the interconnect that will provide high performance for the DMC interface.<br\/><br\/>If successful, DMC will help data-intensive applications avoid memory bottlenecks and allow them to run well on future multicore processors.

As a result of the proposed research activities, new improved complexity upper bounds will highlight some bottlenecks of existing algorithms, allowing deeper exploration of designs for more efficient algorithms. The research activities will further develop the theory of radical differential ideals which is essential for any substantial progress in theoretical and algorithmic developments. Among the open problems this project will investigate is the Ritt Problem, which if solved, would provide unique, irredundant, and effective representations of radical differential ideals.","title":"CAREER: CISE-CCF-AF-Algebra: DMS-Algebra: Computational Differential Algebra","awardID":"0952591","effectiveDate":"2010-06-01","expirationDate":"2015-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7796","name":"ALGORITHMIC FOUNDATIONS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7933","name":"NUM, SYMBOL, & ALGEBRA COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":["438881"],"PO":["565251"]},"163897":{"abstract":"Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) continually face attacks ranging from data leaks to the spread of malware; these attacks cost companies billions of dollars annually and can result in critical loss or leakage of data. Existing defenses typically either attempt to secure the hosts within the enterprise or add a security perimeter to the network. These conventional defenses are ineffective in the face of compromised hosts, mobile devices, and insider threats. Dynamic Information-Flow Tracking (DIFT) techniques maintain data provenance information about objects within the system and control information flow by defining and implementing policies that dictate how that information should be allowed to flow. Although powerful, existing DIFT approaches are limited by the fact of targeting only a single layer on a single physical host, which limits their effectiveness and practical applicability.<br\/><br\/>This research will develop MEDITA, a multi-layer DIFT mechanism that can precisely, securely, and efficiently track data flowing within a networked EIS and across layers, and control the flow of such data based on the data provenance and the security policy in place. Multi-layer DIFT holds great promise for controlling information flow within an enterprise in many real-world scenarios. Despite its appeal, however, realizing a system that could implement such DIFT policies in practice is extremely challenging because of the wide variety of attacks that can be mounted, ranging from copying and pasting the sensitive data to writing the document to removable storage or a mobile device. To address these and other challenges, this research will (1) refine existing techniques for performing DIFT within the individual layers of an EIS, (2) design and implement the integration and inter-operation of DIFT techniques between layers, (3) define a language that can be used to express multi-layer security policies for the EIS and mechanisms for translating those policies to tainting and enforcement mechanisms; and (4) Develop a prototype implementation of MEDITA and perform experiments by using the prototype to apply MEDITA to realistic information-flow tracking control scenarios.","title":"SHF: Medium: MEDITA - Multi-Layer Enterprise-Wide Dynamic Information-Flow Tracking and Assurance","awardID":"0964647","effectiveDate":"2010-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7943","name":"PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7944","name":"SOFTWARE ENG & FORMAL METHODS"}}],"PIcoPI":["550974","550999","561756"],"PO":["564388"]},"172940":{"abstract":"The International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) is a premier forum for presenting, discussing and debating new and innovative architectural ideas and techniques for advanced computing and communication systems.

Cell cycle is the sequence of events whereby a living cell replicates its components and divides them between two daughter cells, so that each daughter has the information and machinery necessary to repeat the process. Cell cycle is related to many diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating cell cycle is a major challenge of contemporary cell biology. Biologists have developed complex mathematical models of cell-cycle control in budding yeast, fission yeast, and mammalian cells. These systems are so complex that its simulation and analysis present great challenges to computational science. The career goal of the PI is to address these challenges by developing innovative computational methods and rigorous mathematical theories to integrate the full gamut of continuous, discrete, deterministic, and stochastic models, and support dynamic, seamless and automatic switching between different models and algorithms as dictated by the scales of underlying problems. <br\/><br\/>This project focuses on three specific aims in this project. The primary aim is to develop innovative computational algorithms and mathematical theories about a critical multiscale challenge: stiffness. This project will develop the theory of the stiffness in discrete stochastic simulation of chemically reacting systems and an automatic stiffness detection algorithm through a running-time profile analysis. The second aim is to develop hybrid algorithms to simulate biological systems with multistate species, a special challenge in biological systems with multiple binding sites. This project will develop hybrid methods to combine particle-based methods, designed for multistate species, and population-based methods, designed for general chemical reactions. The third aim of this project is to develop algorithm and model visualization tools to introduce the algorithms and model development in computational biology to graduate and undergraduate students. <br\/><br\/>The algorithms developed in this project will enable biologists to efficiently model and simulate multiscale systems and will directly benefit the whole research discipline of systems biology. Moreover, the techniques about the stiffness are also applicable to multiscale simulation of complex systems in other areas. This research project also provides learning opportunities and training for students across the disciplines of computer science, mathematics, and biology. The biological models and simulation methods will be introduced in graduate courses on computational cell biology. The algorithm visualization tool will help students understand the important computational concept of stiffness. The model visualization tool and results related to the cell cycle model will be used in undergraduate research and education in Virginia Tech and Radford University, through collaboration with a professor in the Mathematics department at Radford University.

This work investigates the applicability and effectiveness of this new approach for a variety of problem areas, including database, networking, and embedded applications. The work will also investigate the impact of the novel parallel execution model on the design of processors and chip multiprocessors.

Challenges include providing security and privacy in a low-cost, usable, and reliable manner. Payments for transportation differ significantly from general-purpose e-commerce in terms of both security and engineering constraints.

Moreover, payment devices must be extremely cheap, mass produced, and tolerant of a wide range of passenger demands.<br\/>The expected results and activities include: (1) design of novel cryptographic algorithms achieving privacy at low cost while retaining the benefits of meaningful data collection for ITPS; (2) implementation of hardware and software to perform modern cryptographic operations on low-cost devices; and (3) testing of human factors and performance under realistic conditions that must balance security and privacy with cost and usability. The broader impacts are extensive as transportation systems are a critical part of most aspects of society, from the economy, to defense, to public safety.

It is generally thought that deep understanding is too difficult to accomplish except in very limited domains. As a result, most of the field has shifted to studying so-called shallow methods. Work in shallow language processing has been greatly enhanced in recent years due to the availability of considerable annotated corpora and off-the-shelf software. If one had to build this infrastructure from scratch, then most current work in the field would not be feasible. Despite the successes of shallow language understanding, however, one cannot, for instance, build sophisticated dialogue systems or NL interfaces to intelligent systems, (e.g., humanrobot interaction) using off-the-shelf shallow components. For these and many other applications, we need deeper understanding. However, there are currently no resources or toolkits to support deep understanding. <br\/><br\/>This planning grant focuses on identifying the resources that the research community would find most useful and exploring what would be useful APIs to this resource (e.g., deep semantic parsers, semantic lexicons and ontologies, discourse processing capabilities such as ontology-based reference resolution, surface speech act interpretation). The interested communities fall into two broad camps. The first are what we might call technology users, people who want to use deep understanding capabilities but whose research interests are in some other area of intelligent systems (e.g., reasoning, learning, image interpretation, robotics). The second camp, technology developers, consist of researchers in NLP who are pushing research in NLP further. A critical subpart of this second group are students studying to become natural language researchers and technology developers. Through a series of case studies and a workshop, we explore the viability of different delivery mechanisms and needs for the different types of users and for different applications.","title":"CI-P: Deep Understanding Resources","awardID":"0958193","effectiveDate":"2010-06-01","expirationDate":"2012-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7359","name":"COMPUTING RES INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["517044",434552],"PO":["565215"]},"163733":{"abstract":"Although the World-Wide-Web was initially conceived as a vehicle for delivering documents, it is now being used more and more for delivering sophisticated interactive applications.

This project is exploring a new architecture for Web application development, where applications are created by assembling high-level reusable components rather than building from scratch. A component architecture can dramatically simplify the development of interactive Web applications by encouraging reusability and by hiding inside the components many of the complexities that bedevil Web developers today.

We are exploring design choices, creating production-quality implementations for both framework elements and specific components, and evaluating the implementations.

The work supports a critical research agenda of the software engineering community and facilitates technology transfer of traceability solutions to business and industry. Traceability refers to the ability to capture the relationships between different artifacts of a software-intensive system development project, including code, requirements, design, specifications, external regulations, and software architectures. Many software engineering activities involve tracing between interdependent artifacts, for example, finding software components that implement a given system requirement in order to assure that an as-built system meets its intended goals, or conversely, finding all the requirements that pertain to a code module to ensure that the system does not contain extraneous and potentially malicious features. The traceability instrument contains a library of reusable trace algorithms and utilities, a benchmarked repository of trace-related datasets, tasks, metrics, and experimental results, a plug-and-play environment for conducting trace-related experiments, and predefined experimental templates representing common types of empirical traceability experiments. The instrument facilitates the application of traceability solutions across a broad range of software engineering activities including requirements analysis, architectural design, maintenance, reverse engineering, and IV&V (independent verification and validation) or V&V activities. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Despite the criticality of software traceability, organizations have struggled to implement successful and cost-effective traceability due to the complexity and error-proneness of the task. Despite a compelling research agenda, traceability research has been impeded by the lack of shared instruments. The instrument will make state-of-the-art traceability results available to enable the next generation of customized traceability environments and will provide support for conducting empirical research. Results will be disseminated broadly through outreach endeavors by the Center of Excellence for Software Traceability. The project will provide multiple opportunities for participation by underrepresented minorities and undergraduate students, and will create three fulltime job positions. The long-term broader impacts of the project will be to improve software project productivity and to improve the reliability of software, as well as developing software engineering educational curriculum for training students and practitioners.","title":"MRI-R2: Development of a Software Traceability Instrument to Facilitate and Empower Traceability Research and Technology Transfer","awardID":"0959924","effectiveDate":"2010-06-01","expirationDate":"2013-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1189","name":"MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["550521","543540","534438"],"PO":["557609"]},"163822":{"abstract":"Sensor networks enable real-time gathering of large amounts of data that can be mined and analyzed for taking critical actions. As such, sensor networks are a key component of decision-making infrastructures. A critical issue in this context is the trustworthiness of the data being collected. Data integrity and quality decide the trustworthiness of data. Data integrity can be undermined not only because of errors by users, measurement devices and applications, but also because of malicious subjects who may inject inaccurate data with the goal of deceiving the data users. A fundamental tradeoff exists between data quality and the cost to gather and protect this data, e.g., in terms of sensor node energy. This project focuses on a multi-faceted solution to the problem of assessing integrity of data streams in sensor networks, taking into account cost and energy constraints. Key elements of the solution are: (a) a cyclic framework supporting the assessment of sensor data trustworthiness based on provenance, and sensor trustworthiness based on data that sensors provide; (b) strategies for continuously updating trust scores of sensor data and nodes; (c) a game-theoretic model to analyze and mitigate the risks due to active adversaries that try to undermine data integrity; (d) protocols for sensor network sleep\/wake scheduling and routing that balance the data quality and energy efficiency tradeoff. The project also includes the development of tools for assessing data trustworthiness, and experimental evaluation of the system performance.

This project focuses on developing dynamic and risk-aware approaches to access control that allow organizations to make security-critical decisions in the face of incomplete information and unexpected circumstances. This is accomplished by combining proof-theoretic access controls with economic models of risk.

This approach allows policies to adapt dynamically to the changing context of the systems in which they are deployed. This research will have several benefits, including increased system availability during disasters or other uncommon cases not explicitly modeled by policies; reduced instances of permission creep, as overprovisioning users is no longer required to ensure that an organization's business needs are met; a quantifiable means of assessing how policies are actually used and how they might be changed to better reflect the evolution of organizations; and the development of metrics for assessing access control risks.","title":"TC: Medium: Collaborative Research: Towards Formal, Risk-Aware Authorization","awardID":"0964295","effectiveDate":"2010-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"8060","name":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace"}}],"PIcoPI":["534206"],"PO":["565264"]},"163834":{"abstract":"Pay-as-you-Go investigates security and privacy for Integrated Transportation Payment Systems (ITPS).

Two key ideas are being pursued: (i) unlabeled input sequences (e.g. speech or Chinese text) are processed to learn likely confusions encountered by the ASR or MT system; (ii) unpaired output sequences (English text) are leveraged to discriminate between these well-formed sentences from the (supposed) ill-formed sentences the system could potentially confuse them with. <br\/><br\/>This self-supervised discriminative training, if successful, will advance machine intelligence in fundamental ways that impact many other applications.","title":"RI: Medium: Collaborative Research: Semi-Supervised Discriminative Training of Language Models","awardID":"0963898","effectiveDate":"2010-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0801","name":"Division of ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY","abbr":"DEB"},"pgm":{"id":"7298","name":"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["445173",438318,"532696"],"PO":["565215"]},"163746":{"abstract":"Traditional security authorization decisions are black and white: a user either satisfies a particular access policy or does not. This rigidity is a handicap in our complex and unpredictable world. As a result, even security-conscious organizations typically grossly overprovision principals with access rights and\/or underconstrain access policies to ensure that principals can always carry out the organization's mission effectively and respond to unexpected opportunities and challenges. This project focuses on developing dynamic and risk-aware approaches to access control that allow organizations to make security-critical decisions in the face of incomplete information and unexpected circumstances. This is accomplished by combining proof-theoretic access controls with economic models of risk. In the event that the expected proof of authorization for an action cannot be generated, the systems developed in this project carry out an efficient search for similar proofs of authorization that minimize the overall risk incurred by deviating from the expected. This approach allows policies to adapt dynamically to the changing context of the systems in which they are deployed. This research will have several benefits, including increased system availability during disasters or other uncommon cases not explicitly modeled by policies; reduced instances of permission creep, as overprovisioning users is no longer required to ensure that an organization's business needs are met; a quantifiable means of assessing how policies are actually used and how they might be changed to better reflect the evolution of organizations; and the development of metrics for assessing access control risks.","title":"TC: Medium: Collaborative Research: Towards Formal, Risk-Aware Authorization","awardID":"0963943","effectiveDate":"2010-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"8060","name":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace"}}],"PIcoPI":[438346],"PO":["565264"]},"162679":{"abstract":"Parallel computing is in the midst of exciting changes.

However, many recent network technologies (e.g. wireless, long-latency and frequently-disrupted links) have been difficult to integrate into the Internet for this reason. This project explores two core techniques that enable better support for unusual links: explicit path queries and end-to-end adaptation. Internet support for explicit path queries would allow end-points to learn key properties of the links used for their communication. The i-Path system from Waseda University and AIST in Japan provides the foundation for this path query mechanism. New end-to-end adaptation mechanisms would allow end-points to adapt their behavior to the capabilities or quirks of the communication path. In particular, the project is modifying two end-point systems to react to path query results: 1) TCP congestion control and retransmission and 2) multimedia streaming applications. This effort is expected to show how such systems should adapt to the path properties, such as latency, bandwidth, loss rate, router buffering and in-network compression support. The broader impact of this work comes from showing that explicit path querying is critical for simplifying the addition of new technologies to the Internet. By lowering the bar for supporting link new technologies, this research enables a number of systems that will have significant social impact, such as sensors for elderly homecare, and delay-tolerant links to underdeveloped regions.","title":"Accommodating Network Evolution and Heterogeneity by Improving Network Transparency","awardID":"1032226","effectiveDate":"2010-06-01","expirationDate":"2012-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":[458795],"PO":["564993"]},"163879":{"abstract":"While game theory has traditionally been used as a thinking tool to analyze small stylized versions of real situations, this project is developing operational tools for analyzing real large-scale settings in full detail.

This places the burden of adaptation on people rather than on technology, and forces users either to struggle with off-the-shelf input devices or to procure specialized assistive devices that are expensive, hard to acquire, and infused with social stigmas. Recent approaches like universal design, inclusive design, and design for all acknowledge this problem, but promote an unachievable \"one size fits all\" ideal. Universal solutions are not the answer! Rather, the answer is the opposite, that is to say highly individualized user interfaces aware of and adapted to users' motor abilities. Such interfaces can enable people to use cheap readily-available everyday input devices like mice, touch pads, and trackballs when controlling desktop software. Creating software that matches users' abilities is the focus of the PI's concept of ability-based design, and this research extends the PI's prior work on ability-based design with new software tools for advancing this nascent methodology. These tools will focus on measuring and modeling target acquisition and text entry, two fundamentals of computer input that demand fine motor control, making them key challenges for people with motor impairments. The work will consist of multiple stages. The PI will investigate standard and custom psychomotor movement models for people with motor impairments. He will create and validate a Mouse Perturber tool that injects kinetic noise into an unimpaired movement stream to create simulated motor-impaired performance, making early-stage testing of ability-based prototypes easier. And he will create an Input Observer tool that can rigorously quantify users' performance \"in the wild,\" which requires the inferring of intention outside directed laboratory tasks. He will then develop CAMA, a tool for motor-ability assessment that uses off-the-shelf input devices, and TASK, a tool for quickly creating task models from real user interfaces. Finally, he will integrate CAMA and TASK into a package for assistive technology providers to perform assessment, prediction, and the creation of accessible \"proxy targets.\" Project outcomes will include a scientific investigation of standard and custom psychomotor movement models for people with motor disabilities, discovery of how to rigorously measure target acquisition and text entry behavior outside the lab, the invention and validation of a simulation tool for motor-impaired performance, and the creation, validation, and deployment of a low-cost computer-based motor-ability assessment tool for use in a University of Washington assistive technology clinic.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This research will enable people with certain types of disabilities to enjoy more usable software matched to their abilities.

As an integral part of this research, the PI plans to organize an undergraduate summer workshop that brings informatics and computer science students together with computer users with disabilities to collectively brainstorm new access solutions.

A bottleneck in advancement in this direction is complexity. Complexity is established by the natural scale of the system and by the interaction of the physical devices with logic-based control, which create a large number of system behaviors.

By exploiting partial order structures on the set of states and inputs, this method provides an efficient alternative to enumeration approaches and exhaustive searches, which are common practice in embedded programming.

Because many of these formalisms share important formal and linguistic properties (most prominently, mild context-sensitivity and lexicalization), there are many potential synergies, computational, theoretical and psychological, that can be gotten by considering ideas that stem from work outside of particular formalism. Moreover, though theoreticians, computationalists, and psychologists are concerned with solving different problems, ideas that derive from one community often turn out to have a significant consequences for the others. <br\/><br\/>The goal of this NSF-sponsored workshop, which will take place at Yale University on June 10-12, 2010, is to foster both of these types of connections: across the formalism divide and the theoretical-computational-psycho divide. The Tree-Adjoining Grammar community has a history of exploring these connections, and this workshop aims to expand the community of researchers involved in such cross-pollination even further. The workshop will bring together researchers from the Tree-Adjoining Grammar, Minimalism, Categorial Grammar, Dependency Grammar, HPSG, and LFG communities to look at the similarities and differences of the formalisms, with the goals of developing shared, broad-coverage grammars, transferring parsing and machine learning algorithms from one formalism to another. and gaining new insights into the properties of different formalisms and their capacity for linguistic and psycholinguistic explanation. <br\/><br\/>This award provides support crucial to attract to the workshop not only prominent researchers, who will give invited presentations and tutorial lectures, but also, and perhaps even more importantly, PhD students.

The PI has coined the term \"outeraction\" to refer to the communicative processes used by people to manage future interactions (interactions about future interactions). Yet while outeraction is often primarily conducted through mobile communication, existing mobile applications provide limited or ineffective outeraction-support. This results in people investing a lot of effort into coordinating everyday activities using unstructured serial communication between relevant parties, thereby wasting a significant amount of time. The PI argues that the potential for the ever increasing adoption of \"smart phones\" to transform everyday social coordination through the systematic development of mobile outeraction-support systems is hampered, because to date outeraction-support system building has lacked a firm foundation. There are few conceptual frameworks, little empirical knowledge of user requirements and attitudes, and the efficacy of system designs has not been established. Thus, despite more than 20 years of CSCW research into coordination processes, researchers have yet to instantiate a mobile outeraction-support system that demonstrates a systematic understanding of the overall design space and provides outeraction-support by complementing existing group norms for coordination. The broad goal of this EAGER is to lay the foundation, through the instantiation of innovative software that embodies lessons learned from studies into everyday social coordination practices, for future work that will significantly expand our knowledge of how to design mobile outeraction-support systems. A particular focus will be to address people's desire for a shared view of the status of the activity planning process (e.g., knowing who can come to an event at a particular time). As part of the research plan, the PI will conduct a series of laboratory and field studies in which he will explore issues such as the importance of reachablity and locatablity of actors and resources to the social activity coordination and negotiation process, the extent to which negotiations \/ conversations regarding key components of a social activity (its 'what', 'where', 'when', 'why', and 'how') can be scaffolded or require open discourse between actors, and the types of group interaction management (floor) controls individuals often use to organize social activities (current event management software often assumes a single event organizer and provides floor controls that match that assumption, even though everyday experience suggests that social coordination is often far more democratic and ad hoc). Each of the studies will be associated with extensive software application development, which will exploit and build upon the hardware resources made available at the PI's institution through the NSF-sponsored SmartCampus mobile social computing system testbed.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Using computer technology to improve people's ability to engage in social activities of interest and coordinate with others is a simple way to increase our social connectivity. This is important, because individuals embedded in richly connected social environments are better able to handle personal setbacks such as financial failures and illness, and to provide social support for others. Therefore, developing mechanisms for the deployment of mobile outeraction-support systems, so that we are able to more effectively coordinate with one another, is important for society as a whole.","title":"EAGER: Transforming Everyday Social Activity Coordination Through Mobile Outeraction-Support Systems","awardID":"1041476","effectiveDate":"2010-06-15","expirationDate":"2012-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["538322"],"PO":["565227"]},"163717":{"abstract":"Detection, identification, and tracking of CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive) plumes can be accomplished by combining the modalities of sensor and cyber networks.

The cyber network provides storage and computational resources to analyze and infer where the plume originated, the trajectory of its movement, and the prediction of its future movement. The challenges in realizing such a sensor cyber network include intelligent sensing (intelligent sensor selection and coverage) and the capability to deal with uncertainties (uncertainty in measurement as well as in modeling). This project proposes to leverage the convergence between the sensor and the cyber networks to achieve these goals. In particular, the plan is to carry out three synergistic research tasks: 1) network formation by sensor selection, placement, and coverage; 2) sensor tasking protocol with temporal\/spatial uncertainty management; 3) protocols for reliable sensor-cyber communication supporting the above two tasks. The PIs will prototype the research results and integrate the prototypes for different components to build the sensor cyber network for plume detection, identification and tracking.

The central problem however, is how timing parameters for partial synchrony should be modeled, measured, and denominated.<br\/><br\/>Since its inception some 25 years ago, the prevailing paradigm of chronometry-based models has invoked real-time as a formal basis for modeling temporal bounds on message delays and process speeds. Unfortunately, such models are intrinsically limited (and even flawed) as descriptions of empirical distributed systems, because the characteristic property of partial synchrony is not chronometric timeliness, but rather chronological fairness.<br\/><br\/>This project is developing a fundamental theory of partial synchrony based on the notion of chronological fairness. The key technical innovation is that system failures can be detected in executions that are unfair, rather than untimely. This approach leads to greater generality because many untimely executions are still fair. Theoretical results codify a hierarchy of fairness properties, including technical limitations, expressivity, and reducibility to oracular models. Practical results extract fairness models from empirical systems. An integrated critique of chronometric models helps to initiate a broader shift in research trends to focus on fairness-based paradigms of partial synchrony.","title":"AF: Medium: A Fair Prescription for Partial Synchrony","awardID":"0964696","effectiveDate":"2010-06-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7796","name":"ALGORITHMIC FOUNDATIONS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7934","name":"PARAL\/DISTRIBUTED ALGORITHMS"}}],"PIcoPI":[438784,438785],"PO":["565251"]},"163719":{"abstract":"Emerging trends suggest that a significant share of Internet traffic will be due to real-time streaming applications.

Therefore, this project studies modeling paradigms and systems design for utilizing end-user resources for real-time streaming in a peer-to-peer (P2P) fashion.

It has been incubating in academia and is now emerging in industry. This research asks this question: How can the performance and practical use of static analysis tools be improved ? The goal of the research is to find ways to improve the performance of static analysis tools, as well as the quality-control processes that use them.

A wide variety of projects will be studied, including both commercial and open-source. The resulting data will be analyzed using statistical modeling to determine the factors that influence the success of static analysis tools in preventing field failures. Some field failures may have no associated static analysis warnings. This research will identify and characterize these failures, paving the way for new static analysis research.
