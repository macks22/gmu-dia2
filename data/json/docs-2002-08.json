Colorado at Boulder<br\/><br\/>Title: ITR: Research on Recruiting Middle School Minority and Majority Girls into a High School IT Magnet<br\/><br\/>The overarching goal of this ITR-and ITWF-funded project is to increase the participation of women and minorities in the critical professional careers in information technology. Increased participation in information technology (IT) by women and minorities will lead to broader perspectives from which IT products and services are researched, developed, and supported; increased social equity; and greater size and diversity in the IT professional workforce. Prior research shows that middle school is a critical juncture for girls, since it is at middle school when girls begin to make choices more heavily influenced by stereotypical career choices and other culture-based beliefs than their genuine interests. This project is an extensive, triangulated study examining the recruiting messages and methods that persuade middle school girls to enroll in a public computer magnet high school. The magnet offers three information technology tracks and recruits from 22 middle schools in a diverse district serving 71,000 children (55% Hispanic, 21% white, 20% African-American, 3% Asian, 1% Native American). <br\/><br\/>The project takes a communicative approach to the study of recruiting, in which recruiting is considered an act of persuasion. This permits a focus on: the content of messages and how they affect particular audiences (and not others) in particular social contexts; the individual characteristics of the recruiter; and the interactive processes among the recruiter, the recruited, and the social\/cultural setting. Since persuasion is a culturally situated accomplishment and therefore will vary by group, data will be gathered, analyzed, and reported according to demographic information. The University of Colorado-Boulder's principal campus-wide academic initiative, the Alliance for Technology, Learning, and Society (ATLAS), provides much of the structure for this project. ATLAS developed an IT certificate program open to all undergraduates (Technology, Arts, and Media certificate) which is attracting a surprisingly high percentage of women. Part of the recruiting research enlists the help of these students and the TAM curriculum. The results of the research will be widely disseminated through conference presentations, publications, and an information web site with special attention to reaching audiences that make policy decisions and can effect real change.","title":"ITR: Research on Recruiting Middle School Minority and Majority Girls into a High School IT Magnet","awardID":"0220130","effectiveDate":"2002-08-01","expirationDate":"2007-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1713","name":"WORKFORCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["510094","244465"],"PO":["564181"]},"75828":{"abstract":"This award supports an integrated research and education program that is centered on computing motion strategies in geometry-intensive applications.

The core of this research program is rooted in robot motion planning, and it is built on a broader unified mathematical framework that incorporates concepts from optimal control theory, computational geometry, statistical decision theory, and dynamic game theory. This leads to the proposed investigation of three core algorithmic issues: 1) searching high-dimensional spaces that have algebraic and differential constraints, 2)responding to unpredictable changes and on-line information, and 3) solving sensor-based tasks and processing incomplete information. The focus is significantly broader than traditional path planning. The core research is guided by efforts in several applications, such as mobile robotics with active sensing, virtual prototyping-hazardous environments. These research efforts are incorporated into an education plan that: 1)builds an interdisciplinary group of graduate students who are carefully guided through the education and research process, ii) introduces undergraduates to research, particularly through mobile robotics and graphical simulation projects, iii) takes steps towards an interdisiplinary curriculum in geometric algorithms, and iv) helps those from disadvantaged backgrounds to realize their potential and excel in their careers.","title":"REU: CAREER: Motion Strategy Algorithms for Geometry-Intensive Applications","awardID":"0225380","effectiveDate":"2002-08-15","expirationDate":"2004-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6840","name":"ROBOTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["553248"],"PO":["234178"]},"70834":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>SEL - 0204277<br\/>Gerhard Fischer<br\/>U of Colorad @ Boulder<br\/><br\/>Title: A Social-Technical Approach to the Evolutionary Construction of Reusable Software Component Repositories PIs: Gerhard Fischer and Yunwen Ye <br\/>Although software reuse improves both the quality and productivity of software development, systematic reuse has not yet met its expected success due to difficulties in creating and maintaining reuse repositories and enabling software developers to build new systems with components from the reuse repository. The two issues are in a deadlock: if software developers are unable to reuse, the investments on reuse cannot be justified; if companies are unwilling to invest in reuse, software developers have little to reuse. This project takes a social-technical approach to address both issues. It will develop reuse-conducive environments based on the Seeding, Evolutionary Growth, and Reseeding (SER) model to guide thedevelopment and evolution of reuse repositories. It will instantiate the conceptual framework for reuse by creating a set of tools to support each phase of the SER model: SEEDER, BROKER, ENHANCER, and RESEEDER. This research will create a new understanding of the social, cognitive, and technical issues in software reuse, and explore new approaches and develop innovative tools to support reuse.

Particular research focus will include hierarchical optical switching, optical multicasting, and optimal topology reconfiguration. For hierarchical optical switching, the generalized optical switch architecture with multiple levels will be developed where the advantages of both optics and electronics will be exploited. For example, a hybrid switch architecture will include wavebands (bands of wavelengths) being switched all-optically, while wavelength and sub-wavelength connections may be switched with optical-electrical-optical (OEO) switches. Results from this investigation will provide guidelines on where to strategically place resources such as hierarchical optical switches. This project will also design optical multicasting switch architectures and develop mathematical models and efficient algorithms for supporting light-trees in a network with hierarchical optical switching. The research team will develop new efficient models for network operators as well as will design new algorithms for protecting light-trees using various schemes such as link protection and shared protection. In particular, the signaling protocols for set up, maintenance, and termination of light-tree based connections will be designed and studied by simulation. Finally, in the part of the research related to the virtual topology design, the reconfigurations of WDM networks will be studied so that the bandwidth upgrades are taken into account, e.g. instead of fully taking down a lightly-loaded lightpath or adding a maximum-capacity lightpath, an existing lightpath can be upgraded when a fraction of its free capacity is needed. In particular, traffic fluctuations, such as within the global optical network over the time zones, can create another dynamism, i.e., traffic intensity peak rates. In this context, the research team will study different virtual topology-design methods to obtain a better understanding of this and similar problems related to dynamic traffic fluctuations.","title":"Next-Generation Optical WDM Mesh Networks","awardID":"0207864","effectiveDate":"2002-08-01","expirationDate":"2006-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["518063"],"PO":["565090"]},"70807":{"abstract":"ABSTRACT<br\/>Jonathan I Maletic<br\/>Kent State U<br\/>0204175<br\/>A Framework to Combine Semantic and Structural Information for Static Analysis<br\/>Jonathan I.

A large class of applications access XML data through XPath expressions and need to make routine decisions based on a simple test: whether one XPath expressions is contained in another, meaning that the answer to the first is always is subset of the answer to the second. Examples of such applications include query optimization, query rewriting, semantic caching, XML-based content routing. Despite its apparent simplicity, the containment problem turns out to be surprisingly difficult to analyze when XPath expressions include wild-cards, descendant axes, and predicates. Previous work has focused on only toy fragments of XPath for which the containment problem is in PTIME, but these simple results fail for more realistic fragments. This project studies the containment problem for a large fragment of XPath. During initial investigations for the project it was established that the containment problem for XPath expressions that contain wild-cards, descendant axes, and filters is co-NP hard, suggesting that a complete and efficient containment algorithm is impossible to find. In light of that, several algorithms will be designed in order to explore the tradeoff between efficiency and completeness. One goal of the project is to design a complete algorithm that always returns the correct answer, runs in exponential time in general, but runs efficiently on special instances of XPath expressions. Another goal is to design a heuristic algorithm that always runs efficiently, but that may return false negatives in certain cases. Both algorithms will be analyzed formally, in order to provide a full insight into what performance or precision guarantees they offer. The most promising algorithm will be implemented and made available in the public domain.","title":"Containment, Equivalence, and Related Problems for XPath Expressions","awardID":"0140493","effectiveDate":"2002-08-15","expirationDate":"2005-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6855","name":"INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGE"}}],"PIcoPI":["531543"],"PO":["469867"]},"79690":{"abstract":"Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming more complex and market demand continues to pressure designers to produce new ICs in a shorter amount of time.

In a brief period it has reached a certain level of maturity as a well-defined mathematical subject with a strong interdisciplinary character. Wavelets have certainly begun to make an impact in many areas, including signal processing, data and image compression. However, wavelet application to the solution of diffcult partial differential equations (PDE) arising in different areas of physics and engineering has been very limited. The objectives of this CAREER proposal are manifold. The first objective concerns the advancement of the state of the art of wavelet-based numerical algorithms. The second involves the application of the method to challenging engineering problems, which currently are difficult to solve using conventional numerical algorithms. The final aim of this project is in education and dissemination of the use of wavelets in large scale scientific computing. More specifically, our educational goals are (a) to develop a comprehensive graduate\/upper undergraduate level course on the use of wavelet-based numerical algorithms for solving partial differential equations, (b) to develop and disseminate ``easy-to-follow\" wavelet-based codes, and (c) to write a textbook ``Wavelets and Numerical Solution of PDEs.\" The project will consist of three parts: (1) algorithmic development, (2) high- performance computing applications, and (3) course and textbook development. In the first part of the project we plan to improve and further develop the dynamically adaptive second generation wavelet collocation (DASGWC) algorithm in these two areas: (a) extension of the method to complex geometries and (b) adaptation of the algorithm for efficient use on massively parallel computers. At the same time, we plan to apply the further improved second-generation wavelet collocation algorithm to the following two classes of problems: (a) fluid-structure interaction and (b) micro-scale heat transfer. These problems are chosen with an eye to testing the strength of the wavelet method and to evaluating the degree in which it can really shine over conventional numerical methods. Finally, we will develop a course and a textbook on high- performance algorithms with particular emphasis on wavelet-based adaptive methods and their implementation in modern computational environments. We will also maintain a web site where we will post some of the rudimentary wavelet codes for solving PDEs, homework assignments, and other relevant material. We feel that such a service would be of immense educational value to the graduate students in engineering and science, since very few universities offer courses in scientific computing using wavelets.","title":"CAREER: Dynamically Adaptive Wavelet-Based Algorithms for Numerical Simulations of Complex Multi-Scale Phenomena","awardID":"0242457","effectiveDate":"2002-08-01","expirationDate":"2008-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4080","name":"ADVANCED COMP RESEARCH PROGRAM"}}],"PIcoPI":["525383"],"PO":["565272"]},"76292":{"abstract":"EIA- 0228162<br\/>Lynette Hirschman<br\/>Mitre Corporation<br\/><br\/>Title: BioLINK Biological Language, Information and Knowledge<br\/><br\/>The BioLINK workshop will focus on the interconnections in biology among literature, information (in databases), and knowledge (in ontologies).

The widespread use necessitates the development of new engineering tech-niques that can ensure their timely and assured development, accurate monitoring during operation, and robust control, to ensure safety and reliability. This project develops an integrated model-based approach to embedded system development that includes the plant, its environment, and the embed-ded computing system. The models provide a common framework for design and run-time analyses of system stability, liveliness, safety, security, and real-time supervisory control. Models can also form the basis for generating the hardware and software components of the embedded systems, and de-fining their run-time configurations. This generative aspect of modeling is a very relevant and distin-guishing property of the model-based development process. Further, the ability to analyze system behavior at run-time forms the basis for methodologies designed to accommodate deviations caused by disturbances and unexpected changes in the environment. The goal is to ensure that the system and its surroundings are not harmed when aberrant situations occur.<br\/><br\/>The project will develop technologies for run-time analysis of embedded systems that alleviate some of the complexities of modeling and analysis of systems with large mode spaces. Specifically, effec-tive methodologies that address run-time dynamic analysis issues are addressed. This includes three primary tasks:<br\/>Developing a new concept called the dynamic hybrid automaton (DHA) for embedded sys-tems models with large mode spaces. A DHA is simply a hybrid automaton, which can be constructed incrementally, on-the-fly, at run-time, as system behavior evolves. It is based on formal compositional modeling techniques in the hybrid automata framework that ensure model construction grows linearly (as opposed to exponentially) as a function of the number of switching elements in the hybrid model.<br\/> Tracking system behavior using hybrid observers developed from the hybrid automata mod-els. This involves techniques for updating the models of the observer on-line when a mode change is detected while tracking the plant behavior. Research challenges focus on model and tracking procedures that minimize mistracking at mode transition boundaries, and devel-oping code generation systems that allow for incremental recalculation of the observer mod-els while satisfying hard time bounds on the generation process, and<br\/> Synthesizing supervisory controllers on-line in response to mode changes, some of which may be attributed to disturbances and unexpected changes in the environment. A new con-cept, the Active Controller Model (ACM), is proposed. The ACM is a dynamic data structure that explicitly represents the currently active supervisory controller (SVC), together with its generator and actuator. The SVC can be implemented as a generic procedure that uses the ACM as its \"knowledge base\" to compute what control actions to take. When the plant model changes, the ACM is updated to address the new situation. This will involve a number of in-novative research tasks, such as developing an expressive language to describe control ob-jectives, definition and incremental update procedures for the ACM models, and \"anytime\" re-source-bound algorithms for synthesizing supervisory controller code on-line. Robust super-visory controllers will extend the concept of adaptive control into the hybrid-systems domain, and adjust to configuration changes in the plant and environment. <br\/><br\/>The success of all three components of this project is very heavily dependent on handling computa-tional complexity issues in incremental model generation, code generation for the hybrid observer, and on-line supervisory controller synthesis based on desired objectives for the plant. Therefore, complexity studies of the synthesis and code generation algorithms is an important component of the project. The goals are ambitious, but the success of these methods will offer new flexibility in embed-ded applications while addressing issues of reliability and safety during run-time operation.","title":"Dynamic Modeling, Analysis, and Synthesis of Embedded Hybrid Systems","awardID":"0208799","effectiveDate":"2002-08-01","expirationDate":"2005-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2801","name":"EMBEDDED & HYBRID SYSTEMS(EHS)"}}],"PIcoPI":["536406","553600","491916"],"PO":["561889"]},"75381":{"abstract":"This workshop will investigate the research issues and future associated with the new field of ubiquitous computing, which is centered on a vision of a world populated by networks of cheap and easily accessible computing devices.

As features on the die continue to shrink, control of the physical parameters, such as the feature size of transistors, their doping levels, and oxide thickness, will become increasingly difficult to control, resulting in dramatic increased uncertainty in the electrical characteristics of individual devices. Also, the close proximity of devices to each other will give rise to significant interference from elements surrounding a device, due to inductive and capacitive coupling, and due to environmental factors, such as power supply and temperature fluctuations. The increase in the number of uncertainties, as well as their severity will result in a general loss of predictability in nanometer-CMOS design and will threaten the ability to produce robust designs. <br\/><br\/>In this project, we are developing a statistical framework for analysis and optimization of system performance, power, and functional integrity, as well as their newly emerging trade-offs in nanometer design. In the presence of variations due to process fluctuations and environmental interferences, signals are inherently stochastic as are the basic measures of design quality, such as delay and power. The research is therefore investigating the development of stochastic models for performance metrics that capture their dependence on the various sources of uncertainty. The new design methodology will focus on robustness as a new measure of design quality, including delay, power consumption and measures of functional integrity, and will allow these design objectives to be constrained at prescribed levels of confidence. Furthermore, the research team is considering new methods for simultaneous optimization of performance, energy, and functional integrity that effectively exploit new trade-offs and interactions between these objectives in nanometer design.","title":"ITR: Methodologies for Robust Design of Information Systems under Multiple Sources of Uncertainty","awardID":"0205227","effectiveDate":"2002-08-01","expirationDate":"2008-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["525996","508418","517834","517835"],"PO":["562984"]},"72071":{"abstract":"The access control model plays a central role in most of computer<br\/>security.

The chief device constraints are memory and power, and embedded applications require a wide range of Quality of Service (QoS) properties. A serious problem with systems software for embedded systems is that it is not yet suitable for reuse in different situations. Commercial and research systems software typically falls short in one or more of four ways. First, the software is derived from a larger base or from high-level abstractions such as patterns, and does not scale down far enough. Second, the software offers a point solution, with hard coded constraints on both the systems software infrastructure and the embedded device's characteristics. Third, different QoS levels are not offered or are very limited. Fourth, power conservation is not usually considered.<br\/>The goal of this two-year research project is to develop a scientific foundation to overcome the limitations outlined above. This research addresses fundamental questions in four areas: baseline architectural constraints, QoS properties and their compositions, network-wide composition, and software engineering. As a byproduct, a new systems software framework with new and more configurable systems mechanisms is in development to quantify and validate the answers to these fundamental questions.<br\/>The project's research on baseline architectural constraints ascertains necessary conditions to achieve small memory and constrained resource usage (ignoring QoS) at a fine granularity, exploring the fundamental tradeoffs in systems software mechanisms and functionality that enable this. This baseline is then extended for multiple QoS properties, including new combinations of lightweight QoS mechanisms, given the fundamental QoS costs, alternative composition strategies, and tradeoffs among them. Research on network-wide composition investigates the fundamental interactions in networks of devices, including techniques to predict and regulate the effect of a given node's behavior on global system properties. The work on software engineering investigates ways to utilize aspects, patterns, and tools in composing middleware for embedded systems. The long- range goal is that application code can be auto-generated in a fine-grained manner so that it does not contain overly general or unnecessary functionality.<br\/>QoS mechanisms are being developed to address various issues. For example, computer security encompasses many concepts (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, authorization) each of which can be provided at multiple levels or strengths of service. Likewise, many fault tolerance mechanisms exist. This project extends the understanding of how multiple mechanisms from multiple QoS properties (e.g., security, fault tolerance, real-time behavior) can be composed.<br\/>The impact of this research, if successful, is broad. First, it will enable embedded systems applications to be more easily programmed, more robust, and more easily verified. The multi-property QoS analysis and mechanisms from this project will be transitioned through integration into the GridStat research effort, led by the PI under NIST's Critical Infrastructure Protection research program. GridStat is middleware that must deliver status information to the power grid. Exploiting multiple QoS, properties, namely security, timeliness, and fault tolerance, can support in better control and monitoring of the electric power grid, a critical (and vulnerable) infrastructure.","title":"Configurable and Composable Systems Mechanisms Supporting Multi-Property Quality of Service for Memory and Power Constrained Embedded Systems","awardID":"0209211","effectiveDate":"2002-08-01","expirationDate":"2004-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2801","name":"EMBEDDED & HYBRID SYSTEMS(EHS)"}}],"PIcoPI":["267628","452195"],"PO":["561889"]},"74382":{"abstract":"EIA-0218341<br\/>Mark Saffman <br\/>University of Wisconsin-Madison<br\/><br\/>Single-Photon and single atom sources for quantum informaiton processing<br\/><br\/>This research project is demonstrating new ways of engineering single photon and single atom sources for a range of applications in quantum information science. The experimental approach starts with several thousand Rb atoms that are trapped at ultrahigh densities in a far-off-resonance optical beam.

Using additional near-resonant laser beams atoms are selectively ejected from the trap depending on their internal state.

By using entanglement between atoms in ground and excited internal states a single-photon source is being created that has a diffraction limited, steerable emission pattern.

There has been significant progress in designing energy-efficient physical layer algorithms and hardware architectures. But, the goal of this project is to investigate energy optimization and control policies at higher layers of the network protocol stack. Towards this objective a new layer called Control Layer is proposed. A rich set of mathematical tools and stochastic control algorithms are incorporated in this layer to predict, estimate, and control the time-varying parameters such as battery capacity, rate of transmission, error control, routing, transport protocols, and application requirements. This layer enables the other protocol layers to be energy-aware.<br\/><br\/>In summary, the proposed plan for this inter-disciplinary research project and the educational initiatives to integrate research with teaching at both undergraduate and graduate levels are as follows:<br\/><br\/>1) Energy-efficient link and MAC layer protocols for time-varying wireless links.

New probability based MAC protocols that attempt to schedule users such that energy is minimized.<br\/>2) Theoretical analysis of stochastic control algorithms that react to the bursty nature of traffic and link errors.

An example is the safety-critical real-time computer systems on board the Boeing 777, a digital fly-by-wire aircraft. To completely certify that safety-critical systems will operate as intended requires the validation and verification of both the software and the hardware. An additional challenge is the use of safety critical systems in harsh environments that produce electromagnetic interference (EMI) such as high intensity radiated fields (HIRF) or lightning.

To make sure that the theoretical foundations being developed are sound, a particular class of systems is considered: computer systems with error recovery, which control physical processes and mitigate the effects of common-mode faults. The external events are triggered with a certain probability by the presence of a harsh electromagnetic disturbance. The internal events are generated by the error recovery logic. This class of systems is hybrid since it includes the continuous-time dynamics of the process under control and of the electromagnetic environment, the discrete-time dynamics of the controller, and the models for the transitions. The models and tools being developed are enhancements of switched system models and analysis tools. Their capabilities are validated together and independently with a particular flight control system. The controller is being implemented using an architecture that has been evolving for the past 30 years: rollback recovery. This architecture has been widely used in digital process control systems and in real-time database transaction systems. In particular, a rollback error recovery architecture using dual-lock step processors is part of a prototype of a recoverable computer system (RCS) being investigated by a NASA-industry partnership to deal with transient or soft common-mode faults. The new models will be validated using data from NASA Langley Research Center's HIRF Laboratory via a Cooperative Research Agreement.

Facets use<br\/>domains as modeling semantics and are composed to describe components<br\/>and systems. Specifically, individual models are composed to define:<br\/>(i) multiple aspects of the same component; and (ii) heterogeneous,<br\/>multi-component systems. Projection functions and morphisms support<br\/>specification transformation and composition using category and<br\/>institution theoretic semantics.

Mobility impairments due to age, injury or disease cause a downward trend in their quality of life. Lack of independence and exercise can have dramatic results. Although various types of mobility aids exist in research labs and on the market, walkers are used more than any mobility aid except the cane. Our work is concerned with developing an intelligent walker to assist the elderly and increase the ease and safety of their daily travels. The benefits to the user include assistance avoiding dangerous situations (obstacles, drops, etc.) and help with navigation through cluttered environments. It is hoped that this assistance will provide the user with a feeling of safety and autonomy that will encourage them to move about more, incurring the benefits of walking and helping them to carry out the activities of daily living (ADLs). Our walker employs a shared control strategy in which both the user and the walker can provide control of the walker\"s heading. By dynamically shifting the balance between the degree of control provided by the walker and that provided by the user, our prototype can extend the time that a user can move independently on both a long term (as user abilities changes with age) and a short term (as user abilities change due to fatigue or medicinal cycles) basis. This point is critical because our work seeks to augment the abilities that people possess instead of replacing them. While wheelchairs and other self-powered mobility aids are viable solutions for some people, they are not a panacea.

The probability that two logic functions differ can be iteratively refined as additional pairs of Haar spectral coefficients with equal numeric value are calculated. The problem of representation of very large functions is addressed through the use of the partial Haar spectral diagram and the probabilistic aspect arises through the use of iteratively refining the error probability as more matching pairs of spectral coefficients are found.

This project is to investigate the interrupt latency problem in software design. Most microprocessor\/microcontroller systems contain sources of interrupt and interrupt service routines, which are software components executing in response to the assertion of an interrupt in hardware. Because the interrupt service routines execute on the same Central Processing Unit (CPU), they compete for the CPU and interfere with each other's latency requirements. Latency is defined as the delay between the assertion of the interrupt in hardware and the start of execution of the associated interrupt service routine. An important problem is whether a specific set of sources of interrupt and interrupt service routines can coexist in the same microprocessor\/microcontroller software load without causing interrupt latency violations. The investigators plan to use a recently developed framework of hybrid machines to solve this problem. They will model sources of interrupt and interrupt service routines as hybrid machines. The main task of this project is to develop models for common microprocessor\/microcontroller systems, efficient algorithms to check co-reachability in hybrid machines, efficient ways to represent hybrid machine models in programming languages such as C, and software tools that will help engineers to check interrupt latency violations in software and the how to eliminate the violations.<br\/><br\/>Scope: The two scientists have collaborated and published jointly in 1994 and in 1997 while Dr. Hadj-Alouane was employed at Dow Chemicals Company and at the University of Michigan respectively. The model they propose in this project may result in important changes in practice for software design. The project will allow for visits by Dr. Lin to Tunisia and will encourage a mutually beneficial international collaboration between the Wayne State University and the ENSI in Tunisia.

The truth is more complex. The IP-level structure of the Internet is composed from a large number of constituent networks, each of which differs in some or all of transmission technologies, routing protocols, administrative models, security policies, QoS capabilities, pricing mechanisms, and similar attributes. On top of this, a whole new structure of application-layer overlays and content distribution <br\/>networks, equally diverse in the sorts of ways mentioned above, is rapidly evolving. Virtually any horizontal slice through the current Internet structure reveals a loosely coupled federation of separately defined, operated, and managed entities, interconnected to varying degrees, and often differing drastically in internal requirements and implementation. Intuitively, it is natural to think of each of these entities as existing in a region of the network, with each region having coherent internal technology and policies, and each region <br\/>managing its interactions with other regions of the net according to some defined set of rules and policies.<br\/><br\/>The thesis of the present proposal is that this basic, general notion of a region is a powerful tool for managing the increasingly complex demands on the Internet and its successors, and thus should made into an explicit, first-class component of the network architecture. It is suggested that the many uses of the region concept share a well-defined set of core ideas and operations, and that it is therefore useful to separate the concept of \"region\" from any specific use of the concept and provide it as an independent, reusable abstraction. It is further suggested that the region abstraction can be implemented as a concrete software entity, and that doing so will provide protocol designers and implementers at all levels of the stack with logically structured, scalable, high-performance access to an important classof functionality.<br\/><br\/>The region is a generalization of a group and a bound in some space. The two defining concepts of a region are a set of contained members, which share some common invariants, and a boundary, which allows us to capture the notion of actions taken when entering and leaving the region. Furthermore, it is capable of self-adaptation to changes in its size or usage patterns, allowing the same abstraction to apply under widely differing demands on scalability, performance, and efficiency. Ideas are found useful in many places in networking <br\/>to address problems such as scaling, distribution, efficiency, heterogeneity, cost recovery, and many others.<br\/><br\/>It is proposed in this research to define and develop the region abstraction and explore its utility as a general mechanism in networking. The research will proceed through several phases of three interrelated activities. The first is the development and definition of the region abstraction itself, with focus on requirements, choice of capabilities, abstract operations, and related issues. The second is designing and building a prototype implementation of the region entity, with focus on appropriate algorithms and adaptation strategies. The third is to examine and validate the region concept through use in three example problems. <br\/>The examples serve two purposes, to explore the utility of having regions available and to further refine and improve the definition of a region. They are chosen specifically to stress different aspects of the region abstraction.<br\/><br\/>The intention is that the region is a neutral mechanism provided to address many problems, both within a single network layer and across layers. The research will lead to a better understanding of management of multiple layers and the impacts that one can have on another in a controlled way. The research is expected to lead to a framework for decision-making about adaptation to changes in size and usage patterns. Finally, the research is expected to provide a better understanding in each of the example areas of the problems that arise there and how to address them.","title":"Regions: A new architectural capability in networking","awardID":"0137403","effectiveDate":"2002-08-15","expirationDate":"2006-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["125800"],"PO":["292741"]},"71790":{"abstract":"With the dramatic increase in the amount of multimedia data, efficiency<br\/>considerations make it important to consider ways to keep the data in the compressed form for as much as possible, even when it is searched.

As part of the theoretical framework, a general methodology will be developed that will allow the power of the theory to be realized in the straightforward design of new and more efficient techniques.

It is therefore critical to build monitoring and early warning systems for hydrologic events that inventory water resources and accurately model its usage and its impact on communities across multiple scales. Droughts have long been associated with Great Plain's environments from the \"Dust Bowl\" years. Many drought indicators such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index and Standardized Precipitation Index have been developed to model the intensity (severity) of meteorological drought. However, drought is a complex process that also has hydrological, agricultural, and socioeconomic components. Hydrological drought indicators are often treated as point observations in watersheds, reservoirs, lakes, and streams and these indicators have not been extended to spatio-temporal drought regions, reflecting the natural landscape. We propose an integrated framework that views droughts through various windows that can provide higher resolution, better detect emergence and closure of events, as well as their spatio-temporal impacts. The framework is based on an innovative methodology called the Intelligent Joint Evolution of Data and Information (IJEDI) that evolves data and information at multiple temporal (windows) and spatial scales to derive support decisions. In this methodology, data and information are considered as raw materials and products, respectively, with which the concepts of Quality of Data (QoD) and Quality of Information (QoI) are computed. This research will develop an information science-based framework to model droughts as they evolve from meteorological episodes to agricultural and hydrologic events.","title":"ITR: Intelligent Joint Evolution of Data and Information:An Integrated Framework for Drought Monitoring and Mitigation","awardID":"0219970","effectiveDate":"2002-08-15","expirationDate":"2005-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":[194007,194008,"526198","521703",194011],"PO":["563751"]},"72143":{"abstract":"Recently a new generation of P2P systems, offering distributed hash<br\/>table (DHT) functionality, have been proposed.

It is predicted that the number of applications with embedded microprocessors which will be connected to our telephone and computer networks will increase dramatically over the next few years.

The main feature of the approach is the use of an animated humanoid avatar to provide strong expectations on body shape and motion. A temporal sequence of body silhouette images is collapsed using line projections into four two-dimensional patterns that can be analyzed using robust signal processing techniques. To identify activities, patterns generated from video of a person are matched against spatio-temporal prototypes generated from the humanoid avatar. A moment-based method for coarse temporal and spatial pattern alignment brings model and data patterns into registration, so that they can be compared to classify viewpoint and activity. The resulting coarse alignment predicts 2D body topology and occlusion in each video frame, which enables a 2D nonrigid shape matching method based on thin-plate splines to identify and delineate body parts in each image. The avatar data also predicts which body dimension measurements can be made most reliably in which image frames, leading to efficient and accurate recovery of 3D body shape, pose and motion. We initially plan to focus on observations of human gait. Gait analysis shares many of the same challenges as the general activity analysis problem, namely high degree of freedom articulated motion, occlusion of body parts from 2D viewpoints, and idiosyncratic performance by different individuals. At the same time, the periodic nature of the activity simplifies temporal alignment of model and data sequences, and improves overall resiliance to noisy data.

Over the past few years, the ability of image-based rendering (IBR) techniques to create photorealistic images of real scenes has generated great interest in building sensor systems that can capture environments from multiple viewpoints. At the same time, we have witnessed the advent of CMOS image sensors, which are inexpensive and easy to use because of their digital interface. Furthermore, because they are manufactured in a CMOS process, processing power can be placed on the sensors themselves. Finally, advances in semiconductor technology are making increasing computing power available for decreasing cost, power, and chip area. These trends raise the questions: What can we do with many inexpensive CMOS image sensors, equally inexpensive optics, and a lot of processing power? Can we use more cameras of lesser quality to enable more robust IBR algorithms? Can we use clusters of inexpensive imagers and processors to create virtual cameras that outperform real ones?<br\/><br\/>Each camera in the 128-camera array contains a CMOS image sensor, MPEG encoder, and programmable processor, in order to investigate these questions. The device is designed to record 128 synchronized video datasets through three PCs to a disk array. This project will explore applications of the array to scientific imaging and computer vision and graphics. Multi-camera systems can function in many ways. If the cameras are packed close together, then the system effectively functions as a single-center-of-projection synthetic camera, which can be configured to provide high performance along one or more imaging dimensions, such as resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range, depth of field, frame rate, or spectral sensitivity. For example, one configuration could produce high-resolution images 10,240 x 3,830 pixels, and another could generate 7,680 frames per second. Such capabilities are unprecedented for a video system, and they will have many scientific, engineering, and military uses. <br\/><br\/>If the cameras are placed farther apart, then the system functions as a multiple-center-of-projection camera, and the data it captures is called a light field.

Adaptive short-data-record designs appear as the natural next step <br\/>for a matured discipline that has extensively addressed the first two, (i) and (ii), design objectives in ideal setups (perfectly known or asymptotically estimated statistical properties). System adaptivity based on short data records is necessary for the development of practical adaptive receivers that exhibit superior signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) or bit-error-rate (BER) performance when they operate in rapidly changing communications environments that limit substantially <br\/>the input data support that is available for adaptation and redesign.<br\/><br\/>A novel line of research is identified and pursued in this project that lies in a multidisciplinary intersection of Estimation Theory, Communications Theory, and Mean-Square optimum linear filtering. Consider an arbitrary input signal vector space and a given information bearing signal vector to be recovered in the presence of multiuser or other forms of heavy interference. A key for the successful solution to the problem of adaptive receiver design under short data records is to employ receiver estimators with varying bias\/variance characteristics and to control effectively <br\/>these characteristics in a data-centric manner. In this project, the investigators develop a short-data-record adaptive filtering framework that involves (i) the tools for the generation<br\/>of a sequence of filter estimators with varying bias\/variance tradeoff, as well as (ii) the tools for selecting the most appropriate estimator in the sequence for a given input data<br\/>record. The Auxiliary-Vector (AV) filtering means developed by the investigators during the past few years as a state-of-the-art practical engineering solution to the problem of short-data-record <br\/>adaptive filtering is used as a benchmark case-study. The theoretical and practical implications of such a research framework are far reaching. Biased estimators and algorithms that<br\/>offer full control over the bias\/variance balance are rarely reported in the literature, if any in a communications applicable context. While the target applications of this work are all critical<br\/>communications problems, the pertinent theoretical developments may touch many aspects of multidisciplinary engineering that are hampered by the ``curse of dimensionality'' and could benefit from adaptive filtering and\/or adaptive system optimization through limited input data.","title":"ITR: Development of a Novel Short-Data-Record Adaptive Filtering Framework for Rapidly Changing Communications Environments","awardID":"0219903","effectiveDate":"2002-08-15","expirationDate":"2006-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["490699","490695"],"PO":["564898"]},"71165":{"abstract":"This research seeks to create a new global-scale information facility<br\/>on the Internet in which structured data, rather than raw text, is the<br\/>key element supported.

The research is organized into three majre emphases:<br\/><br\/>Code Safety Checks for Control Applications: This research seeks to exploit the structure of control applications and develop programming restrictions that do not hinder the development of legitimate control applications, but facilitate compiler based static checks for critical properties such as memory safety. The restrictions are specified in a language-independent manner. This is the first line of defense against code, data and process access faults and attacks. A prototype of a secure programming environment based on the LLVM compiler system is being developed that implements the above strategies and demonstrates their effectiveness for single plant control applications.<br\/><br\/>Advanced Safety Controllers against Semantic Faults and Attacks: This research is developing the Invariance Control Method for reliable switching control for safety controller designs. The focus is theory and procedures for systematically constructing safety controllers for online control software upgrade. The inter-dependency between compiler based protection, controller designs and runtime protections is a key concern. The inter-play is studied between programming restrictions, the expressiveness needed in the design of advanced controllers, and automatic generation of minimal and sufficient runtime assertions for dynamic behaviors that cannot be completely checked by static analysis.<br\/><br\/>Efficient Runtime Protections: Traditional runtime protections rely on the extensive use of the process abstraction and execution time monitoring. With code safety checks, it is now possible to develop threads that are logically protected from each other for most applications. The process abstraction will be used only for complex modules whose safety cannot be verified by compiler static analysis. The goal is a new generation of efficient and fault tolerant dynamic real time architectures that can capitalize on the integration between compiler static analysis, safety controller and runtime monitoring and recovery. <br\/><br\/>Experimentation focuses on the next generation Telelab demonstration facility, based on the new framework, that can measure the following: 1) the size of the stability envelope and the reduction of safety controller energy under the theory of invariance control; 2) the runtime efficiency gain in storage and in CPU usage resulted from the integration of complier support and runtime; 3) the robustness against faults and attacks of this new framework.","title":"Flexible and Survivable Embedded Systems","awardID":"0209202","effectiveDate":"2002-08-01","expirationDate":"2006-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2801","name":"EMBEDDED & HYBRID SYSTEMS(EHS)"}}],"PIcoPI":["474699","553686","542046"],"PO":["561889"]},"72089":{"abstract":"Networked information systems play an increasingly important role in critical infrastructures such as power generation and distribution, transportation, commerce, and national security. The continuing spate of security incidents reported by organizations such as CERT Coordination Center demonstrates that in spite of best efforts in securing systems, \"hacker\" attacks will penetrate even the best defense mechanisms. To cope with such attacks, new techniques need to be developed that can detect and respond to such attacks. Unfortunately, existing approaches focus primarily on after-the-fact detection of such attacks. Moreover, intrusion response relies primarily on human involvement. These two factors mean that fast-progressing attacks (e.g., programmed attacks) can effect significant damage before any protective response is launched. Recovery from such damage is labor-intensive, and will render the target system unavailable for hours if not days. This project will develop new approach that automates intrusion responses so that the target system can defend itself from serious damage due to attacks. It will build on the proposer's successful research in specification-based intrusion detection. Key technical components of this project include: specification language enhancements to express response actions, techniques for isolating compromised processes so that they do not interfere with the rest of the system, and deception techniques that can provide an illusion of success to attacker while protecting the target the system.","title":"A New Approach for Securing Systems Using Automated Adaptive Intrusion Response","awardID":"0208877","effectiveDate":"2002-08-01","expirationDate":"2007-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2802","name":"TRUSTED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["550275"],"PO":["521752"]},"76104":{"abstract":"The ACM Special Interest Group in Data Communications (SIGCOMM) will sponsor a one-day workshop on \"Computer Networking: Curriculum Designs and Educational Challenges,\" August 20, 2002, preceding the annual ACM Sigcomm 2002 conference in Pittsburgh, PA.

As network capacities increase, the bandwidth of these resources will become a performance bottleneck.<br\/><br\/>While many network interfaces continue to use special-purpose hardware, several programmable network interfaces exist. These programmable network interfaces are currently used to offload computations such as TCP\/IP checksum calculation from the CPU. Such optimizations provide substantial benefits, but they underutilize the flexibility of programmable network processors by using them only for fixed functionality that is already implemented efficiently in special-purpose hardware. A key deficiency is<br\/>that current network interfaces use storage primarily as buffer space for incoming and outgoing transmissions, thus retaining the logical semantics of a simple wire. In reality, however, a programmable network interface is a node in a heterogeneous multiprocessor system, where the CPU and main memory<br\/>form one node and the network processor and its local memory form another.<br\/><br\/>We propose to exploit the heterogeneous multiprocessing capability of a server with a programmable network interface through better utilization of both storage and computation. First, we intend to use some of the local memory on the network interface as a cache of frequently-served content.<br\/>This will substantially reduce the load on the local interconnect, the system memory, and the CPU for setting up DMA transfers. Second, we intend to explore ways to utilize the flexible computation provided by network processors in the network interface. This will further improve server performance by offloading demanding networking tasks from the CPU and also enable additional services beyond those offered today by our richer use of storage on the interface.<br\/><br\/>Finally, we will consider the impact of these proposals on network processor architectures. Network processors today have been designed primarily for routers and low-level packet processing. However, our proposals lead to substantially different workloads for programmable network interfaces in<br\/>servers, requiring systems with flexibility akin to modern high-performance microprocessors along with the packet processing efficiency of network processors. We plan to investigate various hybrid designs, as well as tighter coupling between the CPU and network processor.","title":"Operating System and Architectural Implications of Programmable Network Interfaces","awardID":"0209174","effectiveDate":"2002-08-01","expirationDate":"2006-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4715","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["551027","517389"],"PO":["562984"]},"74466":{"abstract":"This research project will develop improved mathematical representations of three-dimensional objects, for use across a variety of applications. Underlying model representations in computer graphics, computer-aided geometric design, engineering analysis, and medical visualization have historically been driven by different requirements. Thus, different algorithmic and computational foundations have evolved yielding two largely disparate formulations. Differences in model representations impede cross-pollination of valuable techniques, hinder model sharing, and limit cross-area applications. To attack this historically intractable problem, a unified mathematical representation that can work across a broad spectrum of applications will be developed, based on an extended, multidimensional, parametric tensor product B-spline hyper-volume. High dimensional NURBs (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) are used as a basis because of their ubiquity in practice, universality in modeling, good overall computational and interactive behavior, and extensive understanding. Distinguishing itself from the straightforward generalization, the extended representation will support a non-hyperrectangular domain (non-hexahedral for the trivariate) appropriate to the model, and include supplementary attributes, defined over a common multidimensional parametric domain. The attributes will model both functional characteristics and data represented as scalars or vectors.<br\/><br\/>Recent advances in several key technologies are creating demand for higher dimensional representations and corresponding visualization algorithms to design and analyze truly solid geometry, i.e., working in a design space of non-homogeneous materials manifesting multidimensional attributes. This calls for fundamental advances in our computing and visualization environments. One of the practical applications is designing optical lenses that achieve refracting power by smoothly varying the index of refraction and keeping a simple geometric shape. The combination of simple shape with no discontinuities in the index of refraction offers substantial optical and mechanical advantages over traditional multifarious lens systems.

In this proposal, the researcher focuses on the key goal of containing the effects of router misconfigurations, implementation bugs in routing protocols, and other insider faults that, if left unchecked, can cause widespread loss of connectivity. <br\/><br\/>Dependable communications are of clear importance as critical applications in the areas of aviation, <br\/>medical services, emergency services, utilities and defense become integrated with the Internet. Yet the Internet today cannot be depended on because the routing protocols that provide connectivity are themselves fragile. They take a bimodal approach to security: well-developed cryptographic techniques are used to authenticate trusted entities and protect the protocol from untrusted attackers, but no further checks are placed on the information provided by an entity once it has been authenticated. The result is that once an inadvertent error or attacker slips in, the scope of error is potentially unbounded. As one example of a well-known, spectacular failure, misconfiguration at a Virginia-based ISP caused most Internet backbone traffic to be misdirected for up to two hours in April 1997. Data from one study of Internet failures suggests that insider faults account for roughly five times more trouble tickets than malicious attacks, such as denial-of-service. <br\/>The researcher proposes to work towards the design of routing protocols that are able to efficiently tolerate the above kind of insider faults. Detecting and containing these faults is a challenging problem because traditional security techniques are often ineffective. For example, authentication can validate what entity sent which message, but not that the entity is behaving correctly. The key to his approach is to extend routing protocols with information that can be used by the participants to consistency-check the behavior of each other. This is a novel strategy that differs from most of the prior work, which is focused on adding security in the context of existing routing protocols. The researcher illustrates the approach in this proposal by describing his research on a robust congestion signaling protocol, where it was applied to substantial advantage in a related domain. <br\/><br\/>To begin this work, the researcher will conduct a measurement study of configuration errors in BGP, the routing protocol used across the backbone of the Internet. I have already started this task, and include some preliminary results in the proposal. Such a study is important because there is little data to quantify the kind, prevalence or impact of insider faults. Armed with these results, the researcher will design routing protocols that limit the loss of connectivity caused by common faults. the researchers philosophy is to first put aside deployment considerations to focus on what can be achieved as a more fundamental result with a clean-slate design, and then map the designs into the context of existing routing protocols. Specifically, he will reason about the minimal mechanism required to handle different kinds of faults, and evaluate the costs of that mechanism by using a combination of implementation, simulation, and comparison to alternatives in the literature. The researcher's approach is also to tackle the simplest, non-malicious insider faults first and work towards progressively more complex classes of faults, rather than beginning with the design of a .Byzantine robust. protocol. This has the advantages of both breaking a known, hard problem into pieces, and exposing the increased computational costs of tolerating more complex faults. <br\/><br\/>At all of the above stages, the researcher will cross-fertilize my research and education activities as described in the proposal. The researcher will bring his research into the classroom to enliven lectures, and bring students, their projects, and overlapping infrastructure such as the proposed animations back into his research. If successful, this work will deepen the understanding of dependable network communication and how routing protocols can efficiently contain faults. This in turn will lay a foundation for research and education on dependable distributed systems that rely on the composition of routing protocols with other components such as transport protocols and name resolution.","title":"CAREER: Dependable Network Communication","awardID":"0133495","effectiveDate":"2002-08-15","expirationDate":"2008-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["543394"],"PO":["565090"]},"72531":{"abstract":"This proposal was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 01-157, category NIRT.

First, there is no quantitative analysis of the optimality of its prescriptions for agent behavior in teamwork. Second, there is no analysis of the complexity of the general teamwork problem or specific team coordination decisions. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel framework, the COMmunicative Multiagent Team Decision Problem (COM-MTDP). COM-MTDP is based on the decision-theoretic work in economic team theory, but with significant extensions to introduce dynamics and interagent communication. As a result, at its core, COM-MTDP is driven by communicating partially observable markov decision processes (POMDPs). The projected impact of the development of COM-MTDP will be a new, general framework for theoretical and empirical analysis of teamwork. Thus, rather than simply providing teamwork heuristics, researchers could analyze the computational complexities of the optimal team problem, and analyze the complexity-optimality tradeoffs in proposed team coordination heuristics and implementations. Such analysis would lead to improved, robust, general team coordination algorithms that explicitly reason about such tradeoffs.

However, a typical human transaction is not paranoid, specifically between trusted parties. A similar notion of trust exists for system level transactions such as an e-commerce application. Trust obviates the need for computationally expensive security techniques.<br\/><br\/>Trust has traditionally been defined at system and\/or transaction level. The proposed research develops a much lower level definition of trust --specifically a program's self-assessment of its own trustworthiness. This definition of trust captures any deviations from the expected norm for the program flow behavior. Each point in program can be reached through a set of control paths, one of which is instantiated by a specific set of input. In a compromised program, however, an entirely new control path leads to the exploited program point. Such departures from the norm lower the program's trust value. An affirmation of a norm control path can raise the program's trust. When the trust value falls below a certain transaction defined threshold, the program can raise an exception to invoke a system level intrusion detection utility. The compiler is responsible to construct a set of valid, expected paths for each program point. The processor microarchitecture is responsible for interpreting and verifying the compiler generated set of valid control paths against the instantiated control paths. This research will develop compiler technology for the analysis and specification of valid control paths. The required microarchitecture support for this activity will also be explored. The expected impact of this research will be to provide a robust trust value from the program components of a transaction, which in turn makes the system level trust reflect the system state more accurately. This should allow for an easier integration of trust paradigm with the traditional security techniques.","title":"Trust Emanates from Within: A Micro-architectural and Compiler Support Framework for Trust","awardID":"0209078","effectiveDate":"2002-08-15","expirationDate":"2005-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2802","name":"TRUSTED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["409197"],"PO":["521752"]},"74555":{"abstract":"This collaborative research project aims at advancing information<br\/>technologies related to the preservation, retrieval, and dissemination<br\/>of digital imagery for Asian art and cultural heritages.

Tong Zhou<br\/>Georgia Tech Research Corp<br\/><br\/>A major challenge in wireless communications is that the channel changes, sometimes rapidly; thus channel state information needs to be acquired frequently before the symbol recovery stage. Two prevalent approaches for channel estimation are training based and self-recovering (i.e., blind) ones. Pilot symbol assisted modulation (PSAM) is a popular training method, in which known pilots are periodically inserted into the symbol stream prior to transmission. These pilot symbols occupy time slots and impose a recurring transmission overhead. Blind approaches on the other hand, are completely data-driven with no loss of information rate but a significant increase in complexity. For fast fading channels, blind algorithms may require too many data to converge or converge too slowly to be practical.<br\/><br\/>This research investigates a class of superimposed training algorithms that combine the best of both worlds. Instead of inserting pilots as in PSAM, known periodic pilots are superimposed onto the symbol stream, prior to waveform modulation. The channel estimation algorithm may appear to be blind, but is superior to blind approaches because simple first-order, and no more than second-order statistical methods, are used for channel estimation. The superimposed training approach can also be viewed as a watermarking technique with the pilot sequence serving as the marker. It is shown to be applicable to a variety of wireless channels: frequency selective, time selective, and doubly selective fading channels, as well as nonlinear channels. Issues investigated include trade-offs among bit error rate, transmission power, information rate and capacity, as well as optimization of pilot strength, transmission power allocation, and the effect of the added pilots on nonlinear power amp!<br\/>lifiers.","title":"ITR: Superimposed Training for Wireless Fading Channels","awardID":"0218778","effectiveDate":"2002-08-15","expirationDate":"2006-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":["201076"],"PO":["564898"]},"74467":{"abstract":"An existing real-time virtual reality database, created since 1997 and currently available only on a supercomputer at UCLA, will be converted to a format that can operate on the Internet.

In these hybrid devices, organic molecules with large electric dipole moments chemisorb onto an inorganic substrate, forming an organized, close-packed dipole sheet.

In addition Fourier analysis to develop lower bounds for shallow quantum circuits and information-theoretic bounds on the process of sampling from the quantum Fourier transform are being studied. In particular, the quantum Fourier transform over non-Abelian groups, and hidden subgroup and hidden subspace problems for such groups is being investigated. This is closely related to Graph Isomorphism, and explore tractable special cases while showing it is hard for a Shor-type algorithm in general.","title":"Collaborative Research: Quantum Monte Carlo Algorithms and Quantum Circuit Complexity","awardID":"0218563","effectiveDate":"2002-08-01","expirationDate":"2005-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1708","name":"QuBIC"}}],"PIcoPI":["531365"],"PO":["565223"]},"72004":{"abstract":"Miller, Eric<br\/>Northeastern U<br\/><br\/>The objective of this work is the creation of a unified approach to characterizing the internal structure of a medium given diffuse wavefield data collected at the boundaries.

Despite the ubiquity of these problems, researchers have typically treated them in application-specific ways due to differences in the physical scale, materials under consideration, and sensing systems.

Second, they design inversion methods that, unlike traditional approaches, do not require precise knowledge of the background structure of the medium.

During the course of this project, data estimation and summarization techniques will be developed for datasets with different modalities: point datasets, datasets containing objects with spatial extents, and stream datsets. The approach is specifically based on the use of histograms in different contexts. One of the main problems of applying estimation techniques in a database management system is the unknown characteristic of the distribution of the data that will populate a given DBMS. In fact, in order for such a technique to be useful, the estimation technique should be effective for different kinds of data distributions and query patterns. This is because a DBMS is used for a variety of applications resulting in a wide spectrum of data that populates the database. A new estimation technique called the golden estimator has been identified that employs cumulative probability distributions for creating histograms and captures the underlying data distribution. This technique can also be used to adapt to changes in the query patterns. For objects with spatial extents, this project will lead to histograms derived from Euler's formulation for graphs. For stream datasets, a variety of approaches will be explored that are amenable to maintain histograms dynamically.

The project synthesizes these two disciplines by establishing a curriculum that will combine the latest developments in high performance computing with computational nano-technology. A three-year curriculum consists of five elements: (1) nano-materials <br\/>manufacture and characterization; (2) high performance computing and molecular simulation; (3) wet laboratory experiments for manufacture and testing of nano-structured materials; (4) design of nano-devices with the help of the National Nanofabrication Users<br\/>Network (NNUN); and (5) lectures from invited guest speakers in nano-technology. The computational science materials are packaged as portable modules that can be applied to other scientific disciplines, such as computational fluid dynamics and bio-informatics. In the context of computational science, the project has several goals: (1) It inculcates a sufficient level of interest in performance and an appreciation for the associated issues, so that students will develop the habit of incorporating performance issues into every aspect of software design, and especially in initial design phases; (2) Students will learn about the fundamental issues of performance, especially parallel performance, thereby creating the ability to improve and evaluate software optimization.

This implies that the overall clock skew needs to be kept under 5ps across the chip in order to control the amount of clock skew to be within 10% of the total clock cycle. This problem will be further exacerbated by the steep increase in process variations in future processing technologies beyond 50nm generations.

The numerous applications of such a capability have driven a considerable amount of research into the problem of extracting structure and motion from image data. While progress has been made most of the research to date has concentrated on the use of conventional camera technology. The proposed research aims to explore novel ways to obtain image data. Optics will be used to manipulate the field of view of a conventional lens such that the estimation of motion and structure is accurate and robust. The first step of this research is to study the mapping from scene rays to image pixels to determine what type of mapping is optimal. Next, mirrors, lenses, and other optical devices will be used to build sensors that realize these mappings. To take advantage of these new sensors, novel computational techniques will also be developed. This research will result in a set of new imaging systems for three dimensional modeling and will be useful to scientists and engineers in a variety of fields including digital imaging, computer graphics, human-computer interaction, and robotics.","title":"ITR: Novel Imaging Devices for Motion Estimation","awardID":"0219078","effectiveDate":"2002-08-15","expirationDate":"2006-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1686","name":"ITR SMALL GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":[193526],"PO":["317663"]},"72104":{"abstract":"Denial of service attacks flood a web-site with so many requests that it can no longer respond. Computers connected to the Internet are vulnerable to being used unwittingly in mounting a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on a victim web-site. Past countermeasures based on software patches or re-compilation are often ignored by users, leaving many systems vulnerable. This research first proposes a classification of the various denial of service attacks and countermeasures, then defines architectural solutions in the core (non-optional) hardware and software of future machines. <br\/><br\/>The vulnerabilities of computers, which allow DDoS attack networks to be set up, are studied. Low overhead architectural features in the core hardware of computers are investigated which hinder attack networks from being set up in the first place, or detect and prevent the execution of potentially hostile code. Malicious parties often employ buffer overflow attacks to gain entry to a computer by corrupting procedure return addresses. This research investigates features like a secure return address stack (SRAS) in the processor architecture as a new defense against such buffer overflow exploits. The proposed research approach is unique in providing defenses in the client platforms rather than only in the servers or routers, and in building more trusted architecture in the core hardware, rather than only in software layers. Since application code need not be changed nor re-compiled, both legacy and future software can enjoy the security benefits of hardware architectural solutions. Since DDoS attacks pose a serious threat to the availability of critical Internet services, this research can contribute to the overall security of the Internet while increasing the trust that owners may have in their interconnected information appliances.","title":"Architectural Solutions for Preventing Distributed Denial of Service Attacks","awardID":"0208946","effectiveDate":"2002-08-01","expirationDate":"2005-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2802","name":"TRUSTED COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"08","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES          ","abbr":"BIO"},"div":{"id":"0801","name":"Division of ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY","abbr":"DEB"},"pgm":{"id":"4715","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["518483"],"PO":["521752"]},"74414":{"abstract":"EIA-218568<br\/>Bhubaneswar Mishra<br\/>New York University<br\/><br\/>Mathematical and Algorithmic Analysis of Natural and Artificial DNA Sequences<br\/><br\/>The PI is developing tools that play an important role in understanding the properties of both natural and artificial genomes and thus, elucidates how such DNA evolves under natural and artificial conditions (in vitro or in vivo).

In particular, power-law and Zipf-like distributions appear to be inherent to the Internet (file size, popularity of web documents, degrees of routers). These findings are raising the questions of (i) whether effective and valid mathematical tools for modeling and predicting network traffic can be developed and (ii) whether classical QoS engineering methods, based on the exponential distribution and its variants, can still be useful, if appropriately adapted. This project aims at providing positive, constructive answers to these questions, through the development of tractable, end-to-end QoS engineering solutions, applicable to current and future networks.<br\/> Specifcally, this project will focus on the development of a new QoS methodology, tailored<br\/>for multiple time-scale traffic, termed Stochastically Bounded Burstiness (SBB) calculus. This<br\/>methodology provides robust statistical bounds on various performance measures, such as delay, at each node of a network. The SBB calculus applies to very general network settings and leads to high utilization of network resources. This project proposes to address a number of fundamental research issues towards a possible implementation of the SBB calculus into practical QoS architectures, such as, but not limited to, DiffServ. These issues are related to (i) traffic characterization and measurements (ii) policing (iii) admission control and QoS routing and (iv) network topology (the SBB calculus currently applies only to acyclic networks). In addition, the applicability of this methodology to new types of networks, such as small ad-hoc networks, will be investigated, in a collaborative effort with Nokia.<br\/> Next, this project proposes to elaborate an innovative framework for the modeling and the<br\/>analysis of power-law distributions, such as the Pareto distribution.

The main area of investigation is the<br\/>information theoretic content of the transmitted signals, i.e. a study of how<br\/>many bits of information need to be transmitted between the different components<br\/>in order to make the physical system meet its specifications. For instance,<br\/>autonomous robotic systems are normally relaying on a variety of heterogeneous<br\/>sensors, and the question then becomes, which of the sensors are needed? And<br\/>furthermore, is it possible to compress the data in a systematic way, e.g. using<br\/>virtual sensors, so that information that is not essential to the current task,<br\/>or mode of operation, can be discarded?<br\/><br\/>Since the sensory data needed for accomplishing a certain task depends both on<br\/>the control law, the dynamics of the system, and the complexity of the task,<br\/>information theory provides a tool for treating questions concerning sensor and<br\/>actuator selection and control mode design in a unified way. This project is<br\/>focused on the following two enabling areas of research:<br\/>1. Modeling of the information theoretic content of the symbolic, computer<br\/>generated inputs used for controlling continuous, mechanical devices.<br\/>2. Selection of embedded sensors and actuators for a multi-agent, robotic<br\/>system. This selection is done so that the control system meets its<br\/>specifications in the presence of bandwidth constraints, i.e. so the robots<br\/>maintain formation while avoiding obstacles in the environment.<br\/><br\/>In this project computer generated, or linguistic control commands are modeled<br\/>as strings of mode descriptions that can be read by trigger based hybrid<br\/>systems. In other words, models for software based control of physical,<br\/>continuous devices are developed in such a way that the actual control signals<br\/>have a clear information theoretic content in terms of code lengths, thus<br\/>connecting the field of multi-modal control with that of information theory.<br\/>This model enables the investigation of component integration issues. Since each<br\/>sensor or actuator contributes to the total number of bits needed for coding the<br\/>control signals, by minimizing the code lengths subject to the constraint that<br\/>the system should behave in a satisfactory way, a natural measure of what<br\/>components are needed in the current mode of operation is derived. Furthermore,<br\/>the explicit focus on code lengths has immediate implication on coding theory,<br\/>i.e. a theory for how the information shared between different embedded<br\/>components should be represented is a direct consequence of this research.<br\/><br\/>The information theoretic approach to control theory under investigation in this<br\/>project has a number of potential applications outside the field of embedded<br\/>control. For instance, in teleoperated robotics the control signals are<br\/>transmitted over communication channels in which the presence of channel noise<br\/>makes it preferable to transmit instructions that are as short as possible. A<br\/>related problem arises in the area of minimum attention control, where an<br\/>attention functional is defined as a measure of the control variability.","title":"Communications in Embedded Control Systems","awardID":"0207411","effectiveDate":"2002-08-15","expirationDate":"2005-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"2801","name":"EMBEDDED & HYBRID SYSTEMS(EHS)"}}],"PIcoPI":["553540"],"PO":["561889"]},"74613":{"abstract":"Data storage systems represent one of the pillars supporting<br\/>the modern information age.

The bulk of the infrastructure consists of a cluster of \"blade\" servers. Since blade servers consume less power and allow finer control of power states than traditional servers, they are considered ideal for power and energy conservation research. The infrastructure supports two research studies in:<br\/>Strategies for conserving power and energy in cluster-based Internet servers, such as high-capacity WWW, database, or file servers<br\/>Computation and data servers in the context of a tamper-resistant and fault-tolerant sensor network.<br\/>The former project involves servers that support most WWW data\/hosting centers, Internet companies, and a large number of teaching and research institutions, but consume significant amounts of power and energy. Conserving these resources is critical to reduce the installation and operation costs of these clusters. Conserving power and energy without degrading performance (or at least without degrading excessively) constitutes the challenge. The cluster blades proposed enable designs and experiments with techniques that can schedule the demand for resources, permitting transitioning from active to low-power model without relevant performance penalty. The project experiments with heterogeneous servers comprising combination of blades and traditional, power-hungry servers. The latter project designs the sensor network to identify, monitor, and track objects or subjects within a physical space. This overall space is divided into subspaces, where each subspace has its own server (or small cluster of servers), and all servers are connected via a network. The design allows local and global processing and evaluation of sensor data.

The cluster of blades enables the study of energy behavior of the critical server tasks in this environment, as well as experiment with techniques that can reduce the energy consumption of these tasks without noticeably degrading their performance and functionality.<br\/>On the educational side, the blades and the systems will be exploited developing operating systems, distributed computing, and compiler courses.

As this growth continues, the Internet will be expected to support an increasing number of high-speed real-time applications, such as Internet telephony, video conferencing, and video distribution, which not only require significant bandwidth, but also have quality of service requirements with respect to delay and reliability of transmitted data.<br\/> Recent advances in optical transmission technology and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems have enabled the development of advanced communication systems which are capable of providing large amounts of bandwidth in the core of emerging telecommunications networks. Similar advances in optical switching technologies will enable the deployment of highly flexible all-optical networks in the near future. Existing optical switching technology allows for the creation of networks in which all-optical circuit-switched connections can be established end-to-end. As optical switch technology evolves, networks in which packets are switched optically at each node will become possible, offering an even greater degree of flexibility. Through the intelligent design of switch architectures and dynamic protocols, these photonic packet-switched networks have the potential to fulfill the diverse requirements of emerging broadband applications. This proposal outlines a career development plan for research and education in the area of photonic packet switching.<br\/> The research plan will investigate the feasibility and suitability of photonic packet-switched networks for supporting the traffic requirements of emerging Internet applications. Emphasis will be placed on the design and evaluation of protocols and architectures for improving photonic packet network performance, while also addressing the unique physical-layer properties of optical networks. The specific objectives of the research project will be to 1) investigate protocols for resolving contention and providing differentiated levels of service in photonic packet-switched networks, 2) investigate new techniques for contention resolution in optical burst-switched networks, 3) investigate static and dynamic approaches for avoiding contention and for reducing congestion in photonic packet-switched networks, and 4) develop an integrated framework for evaluating the performance of these networks on both the physical layer and network<br\/>layer in terms of metrics such as delay, packet loss, and signal quality. This research will provide a foundation for the deployment of high-speed photonic packet-switched networks, and will identify key design parameters and trade-offs associated with the implementation of such networks.<br\/> The education plan will focus on 1) developing new networking and telecommunications curriculum at both the undergraduate and graduate level, 2) organizing activities such as seminars and workshops to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from the university to surrounding industry, 3) developing new methods for providing education over the Internet, and 4) developing an outreach program to encourage under-represented minorities to seek careers in science and engineering.","title":"CAREER: Design and Analysis of Photonic Packet-Switched Networks","awardID":"0133899","effectiveDate":"2002-08-01","expirationDate":"2007-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["542048"],"PO":["565090"]},"70840":{"abstract":"This project will investigate the problem of providing better access <br\/>to web information and services to a rapidly growing user population. <br\/>The goal is to take the next step toward scalability by performing a <br\/>systematic study of architecture, problems, and performance issues <br\/>in content distribution networks.

Even linear time algorithms may be much too slow on truly massive data. Similarly, even using linear space<br\/>to store the data may be unreasonable when input data that is generated is far too voluminous. Applications abound where these constraints are natural. For example, data stores that archive web pages on the Internet, all telephone call records or molecular sequences are massive, and even linear time algorithms to process them prove slow. Data sources such as network traffic measurements are voluminous and rarely get archived; instead, it is desirable to process them as they are generated to obtain suitable sublinear space representations. Two approaches to building sublinear algorithms are sampling and streaming. In sampling, algorithms examine a (small) subset of input and solve problems of interest in sublinear time, typically to some provable approximation. While sampling has been studied in Probability and Statistics for decades, truly sublinear algorithms for sophisticated tasks such as clustering and building fourier representations have only recently been obtained. The algorithms should have solid theoretical foundations, and should be amenable to analysis using rigorous theoretical tools. However, some of the algorithms will be also implemented and subjected to experimental evaluation.

However, whether this diversity is actually maintained by mechanisms that directly promote coexistence or rather is lost very slowly from systems is unclear. Many mechanisms have been proposed that could promote the indefinite coexistence of species on both local and regional scales. These mechanisms of coexistence are only present when vital rates (survival, growth, reproduction) vary with the environment and when individual species have different responses to the same environment change. The alternative is that species do not differ in their responses to the environment and are slowly being lost through a random process called \"ecological drift\" in which the population size of one species relative to another is determined by the unpredictability inherent in survival, growth, and reproduction. This process is akin to \"random genetic drift\" in which random evolutionary changes among the relative abundances of so-called neutral genes occur due to unpredictability in the process of inheritance.<br\/><br\/> This project will elaborate recent models of ecological drift by incorporating mechanisms of coexistence into these \"neutral\" ecological models. Like the neutral models, development of the new theory will take advantage of analogies between the ecological mechanisms that determine species diversity patterns and the evolutionary processes that determine genetic diversity. The goal of the research is to develop a set of predictions that incorporates both ecological drift and various coexistence mechanisms that operate on local and regional scales. These predictions will be statistically compared with existing data on community diversity across local and regional scales.

The overall goal of this project is to contribute to a redesigned engineering curriculum that better matches the practice of engineering in the 21st century. The curriculum focuses on (1) visualization and hands-on manipulation, (2) computer-assisted design and virtual reality, (3) interactive learning, (4) critical thinking, (5) creative problem solving, and (6) problem-based learning. These objectives are achieved through the redesign of existing courses and through the creation of a new interdisciplinary course. The project directly addresses the connection of engineering with the changing needs of industry and society in merging technology areas by educating future engineers in the 'office of the future' environment. This instructional environment (VizClass) includes tele-conferencing capabilities, interactive whiteboards, spatial tracking and semi-immersive visualization operating within a completely wireless environment. The VizClass system uses readily deployable, cost effective components, such that other academic institutions may easily replicate it. The hardware configuration leverages existing technology where possible and introduces system components for the real-time control and the middleware required for fusing numerical solvers with visualization tools and hardware components. Components of the environment include a series of interactive projection display boards (white boards) and a semi-immersive projection table or wall display controlled by a dedicated visualization server. Digital whiteboards, with touch sensitive input surfaces, enable more accurate tracking of user input. Active white board screens providing either an input or output workspace are linked via a high-speed (large storage capacity) server. This in turn is connected to a numerical solver. The solver receives feedback from the input or 'working' screen in the form chosen by the user. If the input-mode is of type equation, the solver manipulates the equations and outputs the solution as either a 2- or 3-dimensional visual object to the selected output device in either mono- or stereoscopic form, respectively. Visual output can be a distorted or contoured mesh (with, for example stresses, strains or heat distribution), or figures annotating important engineering parameters. The advantage of teaching in this environment is the near-real time visual feedback articulating results of the solved equations utilizing the finite element method approach as applied to structural engineering, mechanics or electronics problems. The VizClass is equipped with a wireless network, giving collaborators and students instant access to all available on-line resources.","title":"CRCD: Expanding Engineering Thinking: Interactive Visualization of Numerical Models","awardID":"0203528","effectiveDate":"2002-08-01","expirationDate":"2007-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1709","name":"CISE EDUCAT RES & CURRIC DEVEL"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0705","name":"Division of ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND CENT","abbr":"EEC"},"pgm":{"id":"1340","name":"ENGINEERING EDUCATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["444397","563526","423906","557605","535531"],"PO":["551712"]},"72745":{"abstract":"This recommendation memo provides support and justification for funding of IIS-0211679.

Farm computing, private virtual machines, computational grids, and peer to peer technologies are examples of di.erent paradigms that have evolved to support di.erent application domains. However, despite their common underlying theme of sharing resources across computer networks, systems implementing these technologies tend to preclude interoperability and, in some cases, require substantial middleware to orchestrate resource aggregation. This project adopts a provider-centric view of resource sharing, emphasizes lightweight software infrastructures that maintain minimal state, and facilitates straightforward interfacing to current and emerging distributed computing standards. Through a reconfigurable, component-based approach, the proposed framework will attempt to provide support for multiple distributed computing paradigms in a unified setting. <br\/><br\/>The provider perspective adopted in this project envisions resource owners hosting a software backplane onto which owners, clients, or third-party resellers may load components or component suites that deliver value added services. Complete control over usage, security, and protection of resources is retained by the owner. Components may implement primitive functions such as message transport or mathematical transforms, or may be aggregated to emulate concurrent computing environments, or may ofer portal interfaces to complex backend application services. Providers of primitive resources or components may publish their availability using either standard mechanisms, framework-supplied schemes, or private directories; clients discover, lookup, and use these services<br\/>subject to usage and security constraints.<br\/><br\/>In the conduct of this project, fundamental issues concerning commonalities and dualities in distributed systems, secure resource sharing, and software reconfiguration will be explored, and will likely contribute new and useful findings to the field.

Based on the results of initial studies, predictive models of planner performance will be developed that translate problem and domain features to estimates of how much time would be needed by a given planner to solve the problem. The models, in turn, will be operationalized in the metaplanner. There are three steps to the work: 1) collect and develop applications and realistic domains to assemble a challenging benchmark set of problems; 2) modeling the performance of several state of the art planners, and 3) developing a metaplanner which is directed by the models to select a planner to solve problems in a particular domain. <br\/><br\/>Planning underlies any complex human endeavor, from organizing a busy life to operating a large airline or testing large software systems.

Future desired services will range from the traditional voice and paging services to interactive multimedia, including high speed data communications. To support multiple bit-rate transmissions, direct sequence (DS) code division multiple access (CDMA) technology appears as an appealing solution due to the inherent merits of CDMA modulation. In DS spreading, the spreading sequence which will be adopted for next generation wireless systems will be aperiodic with period much longer than the bit duration. Employment of long codes bestows several benefits on the communication system. First, it increases the immunity of the system to multiuser interference (MUI) on the average because of less correlation of signature waveforms of different bits from different users. This leads to improved system performance. Secondly, spreading by long codes can uniformly distribute the signal bandwidth over the available spectrum, thus improving the bandwidth efficiency.

The PI and Co-PIs explore alternative approaches to HCI including immersive interfaces, virtual reality and ubiquitous computing as well as alternative input modes, such as voice, gesture, and eye tracking. They have also experimented with using objects in the environment as input devices (tangible interfaces) and giving those objects intelligence about where they are in relation to others (smart objects). This proposal describes a way to address the need to expand the pool of HCI practitioners through curricular changes integrating the PI's and others' research. This project involves the development of a sequence of courses for both computer science and math\/science education students that teach them how to 1) utilize new interface technologies, 2) apply those skills in multidisciplinary teams, and 3) evaluate their resulting projects in public settings. The computer science and math\/science education students collaborate to develop educational tools designed to get K-12 students interested in math and science. The new courses are taught at two public universities, Brooklyn College (CUNY) and Stony Brook University (SUNY), where they reach students and future\/current teachers from both the suburbs and the inner city. In addition, the PI plan two teacher workshops at Stony Brook's Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching, and the installation of the projects in two museums: the New York Hall of Science, and the Goudreau Museum of Mathematics in Art and Science. This combined research curriculum development effort is expected to yield several benefits. (1) The work may impact a broad range of people, including a large number of students in groups that are underrepresented in math and science in college classrooms, public museums, and public schools, (2) This multidisciplinary program will facilitate and support collaboration between computer science students and math\/science education students (who are generally practicing teachers). These undergraduate students will learn about state-of-the-art research advances in the area of computer-human interfaces, and how those interfaces can be used to enhance education, apply these technologies to educational applications in a collaborative effort, and participate in research evaluating their applications in real-world settings, (3) Student projects, installed at the Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching, the New York Hall of Science, and the Goudreau Museum of Mathematics in Art and Science, will provide learning opportunities and inspiration to a wider audience including both students and educators, (4) Two workshops, held at the Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching, will help to further disseminate the findings of this project among the community of educators (5) A new textbook, with supplementary materials available online, will enable others to teach these courses at their institutions. Educational applications utilizing innovative computer interfaces may then become the tools of an even greater pool of educators and students.","title":"CRCD: Innovative Approaches to Computer-Human Interfaces","awardID":"0203333","effectiveDate":"2002-08-15","expirationDate":"2007-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1709","name":"CISE EDUCAT RES & CURRIC DEVEL"}}],"PIcoPI":["546620","477225"],"PO":["551712"]},"70579":{"abstract":"0203396<br\/>Marek Kimmel<br\/>William Marsh Rice University<br\/>\"Bioinformatics: From Sequence to Expression and Structure. An Inovative Research-Oriented Course\"<br\/><br\/>The primary goal of this project is to teach advanced students how to investigate cutting-edge problems in computational biology. The project involves developing and disseminating an innovative course based directly upon leading multidisciplinary research. Graduates who know how to identify and work on solving leading research problems gain the significant benefit of being able to apply bio-informatics to a broad range of problems. In addition to being immersed in a burgeoning research sector, graduates of this program, who have free access to the newest knowledge and skills in the field as it evolves, may enjoy a competitive advantage in the workforce. To produce students capable of leading independent research, the project focuses on three educational outcomes: 1. Students develop meta-cognitive knowledge of scientific and mathematical problem solving in this field, 2. They acquire an integrated knowledge base of leading bio-informatics models and research methods for genomic and post-genomic research, and finally, 3. Students improve at working both as individuals and in multidisciplinary teams. To reach these objectives, the project presents a course in bio-informatics, on a senior undergraduate or graduate level, which integrates cutting-edge research-related content with novel and unique means of teaching, evaluation and dissemination. The long-term goal of the course is related to prospective professional careers of students. The cutting-edge bio-informatics research in industry and academia already is shifting from the DNA sequence level to exploration of gene expression and interaction and bio-molecular interactions. Students enrolled in the proposed course will develop a high level understanding of bio-informatics research and computational biology.","title":"CRCD: From Sequence to Expression and Structure: An Innovative Research-Oriented Course","awardID":"0203396","effectiveDate":"2002-08-15","expirationDate":"2007-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1709","name":"CISE EDUCAT RES & CURRIC DEVEL"}}],"PIcoPI":["517840","193837","557516","225441"],"PO":["551712"]},"74638":{"abstract":"Advances in earth sciences have spurred a large growth in spatial-<br\/>temporal databases with multidimensional attributes.

This context demands a capability to identify promising supply chain partners and adapt existing relationships in response to dynamic conditions. One major impediment is the multiplicity of considerations that bear on supply chain decisions. For example, a material supply contract might specify price, quantity, delivery time and mode, quality, warranty, and many other features. Most of today's auction systems support one-dimensional negotiations where price and quantity are the only features determined dynamically. This project aims to support negotiation over many attributes in dynamic, multilevel supply chains. To this end, it will develop flexible languages for expressing multiattribute offers, general two-sided matching mechanisms supporting both iterative and one-shot negotiation, and real-time decision support based on summarized assessments of production states. The new techniques will be validated using an agent-based supply chain simulation testbed, as well as analytical models. The resulting methods will enable a future where companies routinely form and adapt supply chain relationships for a broad range of productive activities. The systemic ability to respond dynamically to changing conditions can ultimately lower costs, while delivering greater value through increased customization and responsiveness to novel opportunities.","title":"ITR: Multiattribute Negotiation for Dynamic Supply Chains","awardID":"0205435","effectiveDate":"2002-08-01","expirationDate":"2008-07-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"1687","name":"ITR MEDIUM (GROUP) GRANTS"}}],"PIcoPI":[184113,"563733","553879",184116],"PO":["564456"]}}
