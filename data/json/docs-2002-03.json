The capture will take place in a realistic office scenario, as required for a transcription application. The research is geared towards developing a patient-centered care system that would allow patients and family members to access office visit information. The system will have a speech interface to a computer for disease management feedback between patient and physician. The main goal consists of developing a meeting transcription system that incorporates microphone array algorithms for sound capture from multiple talkers and speaker identification. The microphone array builds on the past research by the PI for incorporating room response information into array algorithms. The array output will be adaptively determined such that it is robust in environmentally changing rooms and for talker positions not initially calibrated. The transcription research, concerned with parsing dialog to distinguish multiple talkers at a meeting (which may not be stored at the database), will be tested using the physician's office dialog. Speaker identification will involve incorporating phonetic knowledge along with keyword content information and talker location to improve the tagging of multiple talkers. Performance will be measured with respect to speech recognition results.","title":"ADVANCE Fellows Award: Transcription System for Real-World Environments with Applications to Healthcare","awardID":"0137720","effectiveDate":"2002-03-01","expirationDate":"2005-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"6845","name":"HUMAN COMPUTER INTER PROGRAM"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1681","name":"ADVANCE - FELLOWS"}}],"PIcoPI":["531894",176952],"PO":["564181"]},"67481":{"abstract":"Proposal Title: PECASE: Computational social choice theory: strategic agents and iterative mechanisms<br\/>Institution: Brown University<br\/><br\/>This proposal aims to advance the state of the art of automated strategic reasoning through research and teaching at the intersection of computer science and economics.

It seeks to accomplish these objectives using the following approach.<br\/> -This project proposes the development and performance evaluation of mechanisms for the support of high<br\/>priority users over public broadband TCP\/IP networks (i.e., \"the Internet\"). Support for these types of users will enhance Internet service provider (ISP) revenue opportunities as well as support activities of importance to society, such as military, national security, and emergency response operations. -Impacts will be made on the lives of students through the development of innovative internship and<br\/>entrepreneurial training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. New courses and curricula will also be developed to teach principles and new knowledge gained from this project's research work. Students will actively participate in this research, including undergraduates and those from underrepresented groups.<br\/> - This academic career will only be successful if it passionately pursues research which goes beyond technology development to make a difference in the lives of people. This work provides the PI a vehicle and opportunity to build an academic career that pursues such a passion.<br\/> It is important to note that the research focus of this project will be on priority users, more than on the traffic they generate or the services they are seeking to use. Priority users may or may not expect high quality of service (e.g.,low delay, high data rates) or applications that place high demands on the network (e.g., interactive video). Without fail, however, all priority users will expect network services to be available to them and to perform reliably, regardless of the state of the network or the context in which it is operating (e.g., after a natural disaster). National security\/emergency preparedness users are of particular interest because they frequently need to perform their activities when it is most difficult for networks to support them due to failures and overloaded traffic.<br\/>The primary requirements for priority users are as follows.<br\/> - Availability - Immediate access to network resources whenever needed.<br\/> -Dependability - Ability to carry out and complete a communication session, no matter what is happening in the network or social context.<br\/> -Stability - Priority users must be able to trust the technologies they use, even as those technologies evolve.<br\/> In addition, packet-level quality of service and preferential treatment may be important to some priority users, but all priority users expect the above three primary requirements to be met.<br\/> This work proposes four project tasks that are staged over five years. The first three tasks will develop mechanisms for supporting high priority users in best effort, connection-oriented, and connectionless (i.e., Differentiated Services) environments. Task 4 will assess performance expectations across multiple types of networks on a full end-to-end path. These four tasks are as follows.<br\/> -Task 1 - Endpoint Traffic Control for Best Effort Environments - Mechanisms will be developed for end users to control the performance they receive in best effort networks. This is accomplished using forwarding hosts which serve as intermediate destinations for traffic. The presence of multiple forwarding hosts gives end users choices of paths over which to test and send traffic.<br\/> -Task 2 - Integrated Routing and Connection Admission Control - Connection admission control (CAC) is very useful in connection-oriented environments to limit the amount of traffic from low priority users. New CAC functions will be developed through simulation experiments that integrate efficiently with dynamic routing.<br\/> -Task 3 - Priority Treatment in Diff-Serv Domains - In Differentiated Services domains, traffic is handled in an aggregated, connectionless manner. New traffic identification techniques, per domain behaviors, traffic engineering guidelines, and service level agreement templates will be developed to specifically address the requirements of high priority users in such environments.<br\/> -Task 4 - End-to-end Priority Treatment - The ultimate research mission of this project is finally accomplished in Task 4, where priority users will be able to have their network activities supported end-to-end through new mechanisms to understand and influence performance in the different types of networks along a data path.","title":"CAREER: Priority Users and Applications on the Internet","awardID":"0133605","effectiveDate":"2002-03-01","expirationDate":"2008-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":[174854],"PO":["565090"]},"67353":{"abstract":"Metcalfe's law states that the \"value\" of a network increases with the square of the number of users.<br\/>However, for most applications, as the number of participants increases, performance degrades, and<br\/>so too does the value of application to the user. Centralized service and application architectures<br\/>are most at risk for not maintaining performance with an increasing user base. Centralized sites can<br\/>represent a processing bottleneck, a single point of failure, or single point ofattack. Furthermore,<br\/>a single server cannot mitigate for client's poor network conditions in third-party domains. Repli-<br\/>cating and distributing servers is one solution for solving the problems of centralized architectures.<br\/> Peer-to-peer services take distribution even further by using collaborative clients who are pre-<br\/>pared and expected to perform some or all the functions of servers. As new clients bring new load<br\/>to the systems, they also bring new resources. Thus, peer-to-peer, collaborative services can be a<br\/>powerful paradigm: if on average clients bring enough or more than enough resources to balance<br\/>the load and cost they incur, then peer-to-peer services can increase in value and performance with<br\/>the number of participants.<br\/> The primary purpose of this proposal is to make fundamental advances in the understanding and<br\/>design of applications and services that make use of replication and collaboration in a peer-to-peer<br\/>environment. Opportunities for the application of peer-to-peer techniques in new disciplines seem<br\/>limitless. I propose to examine several applications that are only possible, or achieve their best<br\/>performance, using peer-to-peer architectures and not centralized architectures. These include the<br\/>novel peer-to-peer applications of anonymity, secure ad-hoc routing, mobility-based transport for<br\/>wearable computers, cheat-proof serverless gaming, and distributed information retrieval.<br\/> There are commonalities to all the numerous peer-to-peer applications we will study: the ex-<br\/>istence of heterogeneous peer resources, redundancy of offered services at peers, and replication of<br\/>application data and content. By addressing these issues, the researcher will make important advances in discovery and understanding of peer-to-peer networking and by applying those results to a diverse set<br\/>of problem areas, the researcher's work will make a broader impact in in fields as diverse as security (privacy, availability, and secure routing), mobile computing, wearable computing, multimedia and gaming,<br\/>and distributed information retrieval.<br\/> The major theme of the researcher's proposed educational activities is the involvement of undergraduates<br\/>in original research. The goal of the educational proposal is to prepare undergraduate students<br\/>for graduate school by providing them with an early opportunity toperform research. It consists<br\/>of an integrated plan of publishable undergraduate research projects, new course curriculum, the<br\/>development of practical lab exercises in networking and network security, distance learning, and<br\/>minority outreach.<br\/> By focusing the research of undergraduates on the themes of this proposal, the researcher is ensuring a<br\/>number of benefits. First, that the impact of this educational component is tightly integrated with<br\/>my research objectives. Second, by coordinating efforts with the director of the Northeast Alliance<br\/>for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NEAGEP), the researcher will improve minority outreach in<br\/>the department by preparing and encouraging under-represented minority students to continue on<br\/>for doctoral programs at UMass and other universities. Third, the researcher will advance the department's<br\/>teaching mission by providing a new three-course curriculum of networking and security. Fourth,<br\/>the researcher will produce a standard set of practical laboratory exercises in networking and network security to be used at any university. Finally, the availability ofmy curriculum and practical exercises, as<br\/>well as UMass's existing Video Instruction Program and MANIC distance learning programs, will<br\/>increase the external impact of the curriculum.","title":"CAREER: Advances in Peer-to-Peer Networking","awardID":"0133055","effectiveDate":"2002-03-01","expirationDate":"2009-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"V979","name":"NSA-R4 TECH OPPORTUNITIES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["451830"],"PO":["565090"]},"67520":{"abstract":"This project will investigate how information technology is transforming financial markets and stock exchanges, which have historically introduced technological innovations that are later deployed in other markets, with the goal of understanding how other markets will be impacted by electronic trading systems.

Recently,<br\/>however, a number of new application domains are beginning to emerge that are not well-supported by<br\/>existing technologies, such as the ability to distribute dynamically generated or active content, to rapidly<br\/>deploy new and untrusted Internet services into existing infrastructure, and the ability to dynamically inject<br\/>network measurement code into an existing network experimentation infrastructure.<br\/> These new application domains all share several security and resource management requirements: safely<br\/>executing untrusted code, scaling to a large number (100s or 1000s) of protection domains per physical host, and supporting a large degree of multiplexing of physical host resources across many concurrently active protection domains. Although there have been many sandboxing technologies proposed in the past, none of them have the combination of water-tight isolation and the ability to scale to a large number of protection<br\/>domains required by these new applications.<br\/> The goal of this CAREER proposal is to enable this wide array of new networking and distributed<br\/>middleware applications by designing and implementing lightweight protection domains, technically focusing<br\/>on the notion of using virtual machine monitors (VMMs). A virtual machine monitor is a software layer<br\/>that runs immediately on top of the hardware\/software boundary, virtualizing all names exposed by that<br\/>boundary to give higher-level virtual machines the illusion of their own dedicated physical machine. Virtual<br\/>machines are known to have strong isolation, and they are known to support code migration. However,<br\/>existing virtual machines and guest operating systems are typically heavyweight, permitting only a small<br\/>number (3-10) to concurrently execute on a single physical machine. The first research challenge posed in<br\/>this proposal is designing and implementing mechanisms for building lightweight VMMs, virtual machines,<br\/>and guest operating systems, so that 100s or 1000s can concurrently execute. An ancillary challenge implied<br\/>by this is resource management across virtual machines: to fully isolate one VM from another, each VM's<br\/>resource usage (e.g., CPU consumption, I\/O rates, memory footprint) must be bounded by the VMM.<br\/> Once the researchers have successfully implemented lightweight virtual machines, they intend to heavily leverage this new mechanism to explore several new research topics, as well as revisiting a few existing ones. For example,they will use virtual machines as a sandboxing mechanism enabling web servers to dynamically inject new content-generation code into content delivery networks or web caching systems. As another example, they will use VMs to enable untrusted code authors to upload new Internet services into a virtual hosting platform. As a third example, the researchers plan on exploring the role of virtual machines as a resource container in cluster-of-workstations, in particular exploring the ability to dynamically alter relative resource consumption rates of virtual machines to create the effect of isolated \\virtual clusters\" within a single physical cluster.<br\/> For the educational component of the CAREER proposal, the researchs plan on exploring the use of their virtual machine monitor as a substrate for supporting novel projects in undergraduate and graduate advanced<br\/>operating systems courses, such as CSE451 and CSE551 at the University of Washington. A virtual machine<br\/>monitor is a natural place for supporting intricate debugging mechanisms, and hardware device emulation.<br\/>Having students augment the virtual machine monitor and use it to develop simple components of an<br\/>operating system will radically improve the students' understanding of OS issues, as they will be forced to<br\/>understand the interface between the OS and the hardware, as well as the structure of the OS itself. Finally,<br\/>this will also provide us with an opportunity to revise the OS course curriculum to include modern topics as<br\/>security, isolation, mobility, and OS support for embedded devices (which share characteristics of the virtual machines that we will emulate with our VMM).","title":"CAREER: Enabling New Networking Applications and Distributed Systems with Mobile, Lightweight Protection Domains","awardID":"0132817","effectiveDate":"2002-03-15","expirationDate":"2008-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["532591"],"PO":["565090"]},"67575":{"abstract":"The theory of automatic control has reached considerable maturity<br\/>in the last few decades.

Miller-Montana State University-Algorithms for real-time decoding and modulation of neural spike trains-A grand challenge in neuroscience is to understand the biological basis of information processing in nervous systems. Three major goals facing sensory neuroscientists are a) to understand how sensory information is encoded in the activity patterns of neural ensembles, b) to understand how those activity patterns are decoded by cells at the subsequent processing stages, and c) to understand how computations (e.g. visual pattern recognition or oriented motor responses) are carried out on that decoded information. Two major goals of the research proposed here are a) to develop a formal, general approach toward achieving those goals, and b) to test and refine that approach by characterizing the functional organization and neural encoding scheme of a simple sensory system. These goals will be achieved through the development of a data-driven model of the system. The model will be formulated in terms of information processing units and information channels, rather than in terms of individual neurons. That is, the functional units in the model will be operators that carry out specific, independent computations (or information transformation operations) at a specific processing stage in the test nervous system, and the channels through which information is passed between these functional units will correspond to information channels in the Shannon sense.","title":"Biological Information Technology Systems - BITS: Algorithms for Real-time Decoding and Modulation of Neural Spike Trains","awardID":"0129895","effectiveDate":"2002-03-01","expirationDate":"2007-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1705","name":"BIOLOGY & INFORMATION TECHNOLO"}}],"PIcoPI":["462213","520285","505393","534604"],"PO":["521045"]},"67358":{"abstract":"This proposal tackles fundamental problems in system design using a two-pronged approach including both queueing theory and kernel-level implementation.

Some of these methods have been very successful in practice, but their statistical properties are not fully understood. This hinders the further development of these techniques. The goal of the proposed research is to gain statistical insights into these techniques, and to develop new methodologies and improved algorithms. The specific techniques investigated are the support vector machine, the randomized trees, and the log density functional ANOVA model for continuous and mixed data. Several new techniques are introduced. The support vector machine for multi-category classification with arbitrary cost structures will be further developed. A new framework is proposed that connects the adaptive nearest neighbor estimation and the randomized trees. Through the use of the sparse grid method, a backfitting type algorithm is proposed for fitting the log density functional ANOVA model, with applications to graphical models for continuous and mixed data. These new techniques will be examined through theoretical investigation and empirical evaluation. The investigator will develop a graduate level course on flexible methods for regression, classification, and density estimation, and their applications. Part of the proposed research will be incorporated into the course material.<br\/><br\/>Regression, classification, and density estimation are the standard problems in statistics. Traditional methods typically employ strong distributional assumptions. With the vast computing power of today, it becomes possible to develop and implement more flexible methods, and a host of new techniques emerged, both in statistics and other related areas. Many of these are computationally intensive, and their statistical properties have not been wellunderstood. A clear understanding of these methods is crucial for their further development and statistical education. The proposed research develops valuable insights into flexible statistical methods of current research interest. The techniques developed in the research provides new and useful tools to efficient data analysis, and can be applied to many problems in medical, social, economical, environmental and biological sciences. An important aspect of the current statistical education is the teaching of flexible statistical methods that take advantage of the computing power we have today, and their application in different scientific and industrial areas. The insights and new techniques developed in the proposed research will be incorporated into graduate level courses, and benefit the training of graduate students.","title":"Career: Research and Education of Flexible Methods for Statistical Modeling and Prediction","awardID":"0134987","effectiveDate":"2002-03-01","expirationDate":"2007-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0304","name":"Division of MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES","abbr":"DMS"},"pgm":{"id":"1269","name":"STATISTICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"2860","name":"THEORY OF COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["375111"],"PO":["336837"]},"72312":{"abstract":"EIA-0209761<br\/>Roberts, Fred S<br\/>Rutgers University<br\/><br\/>Special Projects: Mathematical Sciences Methods for the Study of Deliberate Release of Biological Agents and their Consequences<br\/><br\/>This effort will fund an interdisciplinary workshop to investigate the potential uses of methods of the mathematical sciences (math, computer sciences, statistics, operations research) to fight bioterrorism.

Existing solutions to provide mobility, anycast and multicast at the IP layer, and to provide web caching and server load balancing at the application layer, are based on indirection. In particular, these solutions assume a physical or logical indirection point that redirects the traffic to the destination(s). For instance, mobile IP assumes a home agent that hides the end-host mobility, while IP multicast assumes a logical indirection point (address) that hides the number of receivers and their locations. Unfortunately, the fact that IP does not provide efficient support for indirection makes it difficult and complex to deploy these solutions.<br\/>The proposed research addresses this problem by developing a novel network architecture around the in-direction principle. In particular, the researcher proposes to replace the point-to-point communication abstraction used in today's networks with a rendezvous-based communication abstraction: instead of explicitly sending a packet to a destination, each packet is associated with an identifier, which is then used by the receiver to get the packet. This level of indirection decouples the sender and the receiver behaviors. The fact that the receiver is moving or that there are multiple receivers getting the same packet is transparent to the sender. Similarly, the fact that the sender is moving or that there are multiple senders sending packets with the same identifier is transparent to the receiver. This decoupling allows rendezvous-based networks to provide natural support for mobility, anycast and multicast. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, the researcher proposes to build and deploy an overlay network, called Associative Overlay Network (AON), that implements the rendezvous-based communication abstraction.<br\/>The main goal of this research is twofold. First, the researcher aims to demonstrate the power and the flexibility of AON by showing that it can support the basic communication abstractions (e.g., multicast, anycast), and that it can greatly simplify the deployment of distributed applications such as service composition and reliable multicast. Second, the researcher plans to demonstrate that AON allows a scalable and efficient implementation, while offering performance similar to the overlay network systems designed around the traditional point-to-point communication abstraction. The researcher's solution leverages the previous work on the Chord lookup system [40], which is used as a building block to implement AON. This proposal discusses several possible approaches to achieve the goals of scalability, efficiency, and robustness, and formulates the main open problems. Among these problems are providing load balancing across AON nodes, supporting large scale multicast groups, and protecting against distributed denial of service attacks.<br\/>The proposed research will make significant contributions to network architectures. The rendezvous-based communication is a fundamental departure from the point-to-point communication abstraction implemented by today's Internet. The researcher hopes that this change will trigger new and exciting research in computer networks similar to the way that tuple space abstraction did in distributed systems. We plan to deploy AON locally on the Millenium testbed and on the Internet-2 testbed, making it possible for other research groups to experiment with AON and implement applications on top of it.<br\/><br\/>This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in May 2004.","title":"PECASE: Associative Overlay Networks","awardID":"0133811","effectiveDate":"2002-03-01","expirationDate":"2007-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4095","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS IN NET RESEAR"}}],"PIcoPI":["508219"],"PO":["565090"]},"67519":{"abstract":"This project investigates two important elements in intelligent multiagent systems: decision making and learning.
