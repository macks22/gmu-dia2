{"153692":{"abstract":"Cryptography often fails to impact practice because it is insensitive to the requirements and reality of the systems that implement and underlie it. This research aims to change this. Issues considered include legacy (changing the complex computer systems that make up today's world is expensive and error-prone, so assessing the security of existing methods can be more important than providing new ones), malware (system penetration is widespread, exposing the keys that cryptography relies on for security) and the realities of randomness (it lacks in practice the quality expected in theory, dooming many cryptographic schemes). Work to be done includes assessment of the security of SSL encryption in the face of widespread system compromise, technically known as selective opening; analysis of the PKCS#1 standard for password-based key derivation; design of hedged encryption schemes that retain as much security as possible when the randomness they are fed is of poor quality; and the study and design of cryptography secure against related-key attacks. The impact of this work is higher assurance for existing, deployed cryptography currently used by millions, and new cryptography that is well-placed to transition into real systems.","title":"TC:Small: Systems-Sensitive Cryptography","awardID":"0915675","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2013-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["521666"],"PO":["565264"]},"157652":{"abstract":"The objective of this research is to develop abstractions by which the controlled process and computation state in a cyber-physical system can both be expressed in a form that is useful for decision-making across real-time task scheduling and control actuation domains.

Similarly, control strategies can be adjusted so as to be responsive to computational state. Unmanned aircraft will be used as vehicles to demonstrate our approach.<br\/>The intellectual merit of this research is that it takes disparate fields, control and computation, and builds formal abstractions in both the computation-to-control and control-to-computation directions. These abstractions are grounded in terms of physical reality (e.g., time, fuel, energy) and encapsulate in a form comprehensible and meaningful to each domain, the relevant attributes of the other domain. <br\/>This research is important because cyber-physical systems are playing an increasing role in all walks of life. It will allow design approaches to be systematic and efficient rather than ad hoc. It is based on a large body of our prior work that has begun to successfully bridge the representational and algorithmic gap that separates the control and computer science & engineering communities. Dissemination of results will be by means of courses in our universities, instructional materials, research and tutorial publications and industry collaboration (e.g., General Motors R&D).

At the same time, high chip temperature drastically increases leakage power, which is becoming a major component in the overall power consumption in today?s sub-micron IC circuits.

In spite of the tremendous technological advances in hybrid networks over the last few years, few routing protocols have been provided particularly to fully exploit the dual-faceted nature of hybrid networks. For reliable routing, routing schemes depend on reputation system to choose trustworthy relay nodes. However, most traditional reputation systems are not sufficiently effective and efficient. This project is devoted to the research of highly efficient and reliable routing to increase the capacity of hybrid wireless networks by synergistically leveraging the dual-faceted nature of ad-hoc and infrastructure networks. The project has four components: (1) Distributed three-hop routing mechanism (DTR). DTR avoids the fundamental problems in the previous routing approaches; (2) Integrated global reputation and account management system (GRAM). GRAM relies on a hierarchical structure for efficient global reputation information collection and query; (3) Locality-aware P2P-based infrastructure (LP2P). LP2P is innovatively constructed and integrated into the hybrid network for efficient operation of DTR and GRAM; (4) Theoretical framework and analysis. A theoretical framework will be established to investigate the impact of different factors on the proposed mechanisms, and on the network capacity and performance. Understanding and insight gained as a result of this project will be disseminated through technology transfer to industry partners, in addition to publication and software release channels.

In order to achieve this objective, the research is exploring a new mathematical theory of splines over shapes of arbitrarily complicated topology and geometry. The flexible and effective construction of splines defined over an arbitrary manifold has immediate impact for computer-aided geometric design, visual information processing, and computer graphics. Moreover, this theory-centered research will enable a more accurate, more efficient, and easier-to-use software system for processing geometric and scientific datasets. The research is demonstrating that splines are a powerful data modeling, analysis, and simulation tool that not only continue to be applicable to geometric and shape modeling, but also have important extensions to a general data modeling and analysis framework.<br\/><br\/>Traditionally, splines have their mathematical root in approximation theory. Continuous representations such as splines can enable compact representation, analysis (especially quantitative analysis), simulation, and digital prototyping. In order to bridge the large gap between conventional spline formulations and the strong demand to accurately and efficiently model acquired datasets towards quantitative analysis and finite element simulation, our research effort centers on the unexplored mathematical theory of manifold splines that will extend popular spline schemes to effectively represent objects over arbitrary topology. In particular, we are conducting a comprehensive study of new theoretical foundations that can transform the spline-centric representations to the accurate and effective modeling of surfaces of arbitrary topology.","title":"EAGER: Exploring Spline Theory for Shapes of Arbitrary Topology","awardID":"0949467","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2012-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7453","name":"GRAPHICS & VISUALIZATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["416071"],"PO":["532791"]},"153484":{"abstract":"Speech recognizers all include a component for predicting, based on the past context, what words are likely to appear next. Today these components, known as language models, operate at the symbol level, abstracted away from the details of how and when the words are spoken.

Inspired by psychological research suggesting that dialog and language behaviors are the result of multiple simultaneously active cognitive processes, the working assumption is that the words likely to be spoken at a given time depend, probabilistically, on the elapsed time since various reference points: for example since the speaker began talking, since the speaker's last disfluency, since the listener's last back-channel, etc. Statistical analyses of large corpora of human-human spoken dialogs, with machine learning methods, are revealing patterns and regularities which are being used to build language models with improved predictive power.<br\/><br\/>These language models implicitly represent some aspects of dialog dynamics, with the potential to lead to an integrated understanding of the nature of dialog as a human ability.

The chamber offers an electromagnetically quiet room for detecting extremely weak emissions and accurate antenna pattern and impedance measurements. The facility covers a wide frequency range and attenuation of incident plane-waves. Coupling effects on array scale models are necessary to be able to optimize critical signal processing algorithms. Optimizing antenna array performance requires radiation patterns and mutual coupling between elements. The chamber enables antenna-pattern measurements using both far-field and spherical near-field scanning techniques over the entire frequency range. Thus, the work involves designing and developing a radar and sensor technology for observation of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (systems sensitive to sound) and image the coastal regions where rapid melting due to climate change is most evident. This ultra sensitive sounding and imaging radars enable radio frequency (RF) and microwave emission measurements 40 dB below the thermal noise and operates over a large frequency range from 100MHz up to 18 GHz, with attenuation of plane waves by about 100dB at the proposed chamber boundaries.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Beyond the potential contribution to ice-sheet modeling, glaciology, and the overall international polar research community, the facility is likely to have significant impact on education. It enables new coursework in emerging and increasingly critical EMC\/EMI field incorporating laboratory exercises into courses. Hence, the project provides educational and training opportunities for students at all levels in an EPSCoR state, provides business opportunities for businesses in the area, and clearly addresses international needs.","title":"MRI: Development of an Anechoic Chamber and Instrumentation for Remote Sensing of Polar Regions and Transportation Interdisciplinary Research and Education","awardID":"0923443","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2014-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1189","name":"MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":["428275","522541",415555,"538990","522544"],"PO":["557609"]},"151043":{"abstract":"The rewriting model of computation is simple, yet general and flexible.

First, the protocol will produce an end-to-end independently verifiable (E2E) election outcome; that is, the verifiability properties of the protocol will apply not to the outputs of individual voting system components, but to the final system output: the tally, and its relationship to the system inputs: the votes. Second, the protocol will be incoercible; that is, a voter will be unable to provide convincing evidence to a coercer (wishing to force or bribe the voter to vote in a certain manner) of how the voter voted. <br\/><br\/>Existing E2E protocols are paper-based and hence difficult to administer. This research draws on cryptographic primitives (implicit and explicit in the paper-based protocols) to develop an electronic protocol. It defines and rigorously proves protocol properties, using the techniques of cryptographic proofs. The protocols are implemented to obtain testable prototypes, and made available to the community through an open-source software release. Preliminary results about the usability of the prototypes are also obtained. An electronic E2E protocol is anticipated to have significant impact on deployed voting systems; election officials have repeatedly requested electronic protocols over those that are paper-based, as the former are easier to administer and to make accessible to voters with differing needs.","title":"EAGER: Electronic End-to-End Independently Verifiable (E2E) Voting Systems","awardID":"0937267","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2012-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["496577"],"PO":["565264"]},"158303":{"abstract":"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).<br\/><br\/>Golden 0934721<br\/>University of Utah<br\/><br\/>Funds are provided to develop methods of electromagnetically monitoring the internal state of sea ice, the thermal evolution of its microstructure, and the transport processes it controls. The PIs will conduct fundamental mathematical studies, as well as field experiments in the Arctic and Antarctic, directed at recovering microstructual profiles and their evolution at critical phases in the seasonal cycle of the ice pack. They will develop in situ tomographic methods to obtain the complex permittivity profile o sea ice at low frequency, and mathematical techniques to use this data to reconstruct the evolution of the spectral measure of the composite microstructure, which contains detailed information about brine geometry and connectedness. They will investigate the critical behavior of this measure near the percolation threshold, where fluid flow turns on or off. Our work will yield novel spectral representations for fluid and thermal transport coefficients, and characterizations of the spectral measure as a free energy minimizer, as in statistical mechanics. They will analyze the thermal evolution of the distribution of eigenvalue spacings for the spectral measure as a powerful way of characterizing the order\/disorder transition in the brine microstructure of sea ice, as motivated by the theory of random matrices.

An autonomic system mimics the human body's autonomic nervous system that regulates homeostatic functions without conscious intelligent control, and provides facilities for self-management in large-scale complex heterogeneous systems. The proposal argues that with the rapid growth of wireless networking and cognitive radios, combined with the demand for seamless ubiquitous services, autonomic computing faces interesting challenges and opportunities. It examines various algorithms for self-management, and illustrates their applicability in the large wireless networks providing ubiquitous services. These include methods of stabilizing streaming applications in a wireless network, stabilization of distributed applications containing selfish agents, and designing gracefully degradable systems.

While smart environments offer many societal benefits, they also introduce new and complex challenges for wireless network design. A typical home may be equipped with hundreds or thousands of wireless sensors that aid in ensuring the health, safety, and productivity of its residents. If these sensors are continuously operating in full-alert mode, they will expend a great deal of energy and bandwidth. The result is an expensive infrastructure that requires constant maintenance to replace batteries and ensure quality-of-service. The goal of this project is to imbue such wireless sensor networks with cognitive capabilities and context awareness that will allow them to act in a more intelligent manner. The principal investigators (PIs) will use machine learning techniques to recognize activities that are being performed in the smart environment. This context information will then be conveyed to the network to allow sensor nodes to intelligently decide when to sleep, when to wake up, and how to route information. By transforming sensor networks into activity-aware sensor networks, the researchers hypothesize that they will greatly reduce energy and bandwidth consumption. <br\/><br\/>The contributions of this project include: 1) enhance existing algorithms to recognize activities that are incomplete, interleaved, or performed in parallel by multiple residents, 2) design and implement an algorithm that will allow each sensor to intelligently decide sampling rates and sleep\/wake times, and 3) test the algorithms in simulation and in two physical smart environment testbeds.

Tarski's seminal result on decidability of the theory of reals showed that nonlinear constraints can be symbolically solved. However, the currently available solvers are not designed for the features--scalability, expressiveness, and extensibility--that are required in practice.<br\/><br\/>This project develops a symbolic reasoning engine that is simultaneously efficient and expressive, and that includes nonlinear reasoning over the theory of reals. The approach is based on integrating the theory of real closed fields with existing theories supported by Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers. SMT solvers are general-purpose, widely used, symbolic solvers, but they currently lack support for reasoning over nonlinear arithmetic. Motivated by the application to verification of hybrid dynamical systems, this project explores an approach for reasoning in the theory of reals that can trade completeness for efficiency and can be integrated within existing SMT solvers.<br\/><br\/>The availability of nonlinear reasoning in SMT solvers will make it easier, especially for users not skilled in symbolic methods, to routinely build applications that use symbolic reasoning.

Spontaneity and embodiment are key components of creative work in the arts, particularly in the ideation and exploration phases, but have been poorly supported in software. There is good evidence that their inclusion in computer tools has the potential to significantly increase creativity. In order to test this hypothesis, novel new computational tools will be developed for interactive sketching and animation. Two applications will be targeted: One, a system for free-form drawing and animation, allows users to interactively sculpt 3D images by moving tracked markers through space. These drawings can then be immediately animated by grabbing handles that are automatically fit to them and dragging these with 3D gestures. The second application will provide a more narrowly defined task: controlling the style of a walking animation. The user will be able to do this by making spatial gestures to define the parameters in a walking model. Both of these applications will be designed and evaluated to support spontaneity and embodiment. <br\/><br\/>This work benefits society through the discovery of new insights into creativity and by the creation of new computer artifacts that support creative production. Members of the performance community will be included in the research, leading to cross-fertilization with a group not normally involved in technology development.

It has become commonplace to search the Internet for source code in the course of a software development project. Locating the right component for as-is reuse or a reference example at the right time can have significant impact on the how the project progresses. There are a number of critical decision points in the search process, when the matches returned are eliminated or selected. These judgments require a form of program comprehension, though one that not been studied previously. Current research in program comprehension has been concerned with how software developers form mental models of how a single body of source code works in order to perform a maintenance task. Program comprehension in the context of Internet-scale code search involves discerning the characteristics of a candidate piece of code without becoming entangled in the internals.<br\/><br\/>Internet-scale code search is exploratory, iterative, and open-ended, so both relevance and suitability judgments are made throughout the process. Relevance judgments are made by software developers while identifying promising candidates among the available matches. These decisions are rapid, taking only a few seconds, and use relatively little information. Suitability judgments are made when determining whether a promising candidate is appropriate for the software project. These decisions are slower and typically involve a careful cost-benefit analysis. In this project, both types of judgments will be studied with the aim of creating better tools for Internet-scale code search. By understanding how developers decide between options, the cues that they use to comprehend the match, and the kinds of errors that they make, it is possible to present matches so they can find the desired source code more quickly and accurately. The research will have three components: laboratory experiments to study relevance and suitability judgments in a controlled setting; field studies to examine the search process in context; and refinements to an existing research platform, the Sourcerer code search engine. The evaluation criterion for this project is whether the new knowledge, techniques, and prototypes have reduced errors in relevance and suitability judgments during Internet-scale code search for opportunistic software development.<br\/><br\/>The expected outcomes of the research are: an understanding of the program comprehension that occurs in the context of Internet-scale code search; a model of the search and comprehension process; a characterization of the cues that are used in relevance and suitability judgments; and prototype search tools that support this process. These results could have far-reaching impact, because opportunistic software development and open source reuse have become widely adopted strategies. These practices allow software developers to leverage a global supply chain for software components and knowledge that they can use to implement new product and service ideas to keep up with societal, economic, and corporate demands. Accurate and rapid relevance and suitability judgments are essential for the successful application of these strategies. The educational components of this project will prepare students for the very different world of software development that is currently coming into being.","title":"CAREER: Program Comprehension in Internet-Scale Code Search for Open Source Reuse in Opportunistic Software Development","awardID":"0846034","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2014-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["457014"],"PO":["564456"]},"163079":{"abstract":"The Third Annual IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine provides an open, interactive forum to promote multi- and interdisciplinary research and education in bioinformatics, computing science and biomedicine, facilitating development of new ideas for bridging gaps.

The current information infrastructure is profoundly insecure in no small part due to the oblivious risk-seeking behaviors of nontechnical individuals online. The methods in this research are a combination of risk communication with intelligent interaction design. While the theory of risk communication has been embraced in computer security, its use is embryonic. The tools of intelligent interaction have not been adopted to assist individuals in making risk decisions appropriate to their contexts. By combining these approaches to specific online risks the research will enable individuals to make informed security choices. Note that this work specifically focuses work on the identified human individual as opposed to the commonly abstracted rational self-optimizing user. The core elements of the research are: 1) understanding the individual?s risk perception, 2) using that perception for effective risk communication, 3) ensuring the interruptions and communications are appropriate to the workflow at hand, and 4) providing risk mitigation that is automated and seamless. The innovative methods carry a high risk, but also a high payoff in potentially enabling the wide use of many discrete security tools. In this research, the knowledge-based approach to identification of technical risk will be integrated with a human-centered approach to the perception of risk to enable mitigation that is automated and contextually aware.<br\/><br\/>Using the results of our research, individuals will choose to take informed risks based on their on tasks, workflows and context. In contrast, today individuals are interrupted with decontextualized, narrative-free, inappropriately timed, and often technologically incomprehensible suggestions for risk mitigation. Consequently, people innocently take risks they have no way of knowing how to avoid. To enable the nontechnical individual, this research project will embed a novel approach to simplifying the use of security measures. The proposed translucent design is enabled by this combination of reasoning about risk to interrupt the individual only when necessary, using workflow to build a coherent narrative that focuses on the risks and how to mitigate them in context, and combining the appropriate mitigating actions into simple customized macros.","title":"Collaborative Research: Intelligent Interactions with Risk Communication for Risk Mitigation","awardID":"0943505","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2011-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[427568,427569],"PO":["565136"]},"159768":{"abstract":"This research entails: (1) CyberGRID Net - developing a research data collection and analysis tool integrated into an existing global virtual engineering team working environment, and (2) CyberGRID Networks - utilizing that tool to develop fundamental insights into how globally distributed engineering teams enact complex design work together and with affordances in the virtual environment.

Examples include areas such as distributed sensor networks, control of distributed autonomous agents, collision avoidance, distributed power systems, etc. Central to the study of such systems is the study of the behavior of random Lyapunov and Riccati recursions (the analogy is to traditional LTI systems where deterministic Lyapunov and Riccati recursions and equations play a prominent role). Unfortunately, to date, the tools for analyzing such systems are woefully lacking, ostensibly because the recursions are both nonlinear and random, and hence intractable if one wants to analyze them exactly. The methodology proposed in this work is to exploit tools from the theory of large random matrices to find the asymptotic eigendistribution of the matrices in the random Riccati recursions when the number of states in the system, n, is large. In many cases, the eigendistribution contains sufficient information about the overall behavior of the system. Stability can be inferred from the eigenanalysis. The mean of the eigenvalues is simply related to the mean of the trace (i.e., the mean-square-error of the system), whereas the support set of the eigendistribution says something about best- and worst-case performances of the system. Furthermore, a general philosophy of this approach is to identify and exhibit the universal behavior of the system, provided such a behavior does exist. Here, \"universal\" means behavior that does not depend on the microscopic details of the system (where losses occur, what the exact topology of the network or underlying distributions are), but rather on some simple macroscopic properties. A main idea of the approach is to replace a high-dimensional matrix-valued nonlinear and stochastic recursion by a scalar-valued deterministic functional recursion (involving an appropriate transform of the eigendistribution), which is much more amenable to analysis and computation.<br\/><br\/>The project will include course development and the recruitment of women and minority students to research.

There is every reason to believe that this development will continue in the near future, given the revolutionary changes to hardware and software in the World Wide Web, the Sensor Web, the network of hand-held and mobile devices, and the Smart Grid. The PIs argue that improvements in the science and technology for integrating and combining analytical processing and human-computer interaction are urgently needed, so that human decision making is not overwhelmed by the flood of raw data. With that goal in mind, in this project they will develop novel mathematical, computational, and visualization methods, such that analytical processing is done partly by the computer and partly by the human, with visualization playing a central role in the communication and collaboration between the two parties. Specifically, the PIs will explore ways to integrate mosaic-based visualization and analytical processing by means of graphical models that contain thousands or millions of random variables, so as to both improve analytical learning and monitoring by human decision makers. The PIs will create feature transformation and data synthesis techniques based on probabilistic graphical models including Bayesian networks, and emphasizing multi-objective abstraction and refinement. The domain-independent techniques to be developed will be applied to electrical power systems as a test bed. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: It is difficult for humans to reason under uncertainty, all the more so when they are under time pressure or stress and when there are massive amounts of data to cope with. Visualization of uncertainty has been shown to improve human performance, and there has been substantial progress in the areas of learning and reasoning using probabilistic graphical models, including Bayesian networks and Markov networks. By integrating uncertainty visualization and uncertainty processing, this research will dramatically compress the time it takes humans to make decisions under uncertainty in complex domains, will improve the quality of the decisions made, and will reduce the effort or cost associated with these analytical processes. The project's focus on electrical power system is due to the domain's importance in aerospace vehicles as well as to the urgency of creating a smart electrical grid in response to the climate change and energy crises.","title":"Visualization of Analytical Procsses","awardID":"0937044","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2013-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7703","name":"FOUNDATIONS VISUAL ANALYTICS"}}],"PIcoPI":[424165,424166,"563201"],"PO":["565227"]},"157657":{"abstract":"The goal of the proposed research is to identify ways to inexpensively provide specific information about energy consumption in buildings and facilitate conservation. Signal processing, machine learning, and data fusion techniques will be developed to extract actionable information from whole-building power meters and other available sensors. The main objectives are: (a) to create a framework for obtaining disaggregated, appliance-specific feedback about electricity consumption in a building by extracting high-value information from low-cost data sources; and (b) to investigate and develop data mining and machine learning algorithms for making use of appliance-specific electricity data, in order to provide users with recommendations on how to optimize their energy consumption and understand the effects of their energy-related decisions. A series of residential buildings in Pittsburgh, PA will serve as a test-bed for evaluating and validating our proposed approach. Blueroof Technologies, a non-profit corporation located in McKeesport, PA that researches, develops and provides affordable senior-citizen housing with integrated sensor networks and building automation systems, will provide access to their Research Cottages for this project. Similarly, Robert Bosch LLC, a leading global provider of consumer goods and building technology, will provide additional technical research assistance and expertise.<br\/><br\/>The main scientific merit of the project is the development of a framework for evaluating energy-use-disaggregation methods according to their value for promoting energy conservation. The resulting data sets will be large enough to produce significant conclusions about the feasibility and effectiveness of the technology, and allow for the development of new models about the trends and patterns of appliance usage in buildings. <br\/><br\/>Broader impacts of this research include providing a foundation for future cyber-physical systems by inexpensively obtaining real-time appliance-level data. Such data can be used to help reduce the energy consumption of buildings by revealing the relationship between users' behavior and electricity consumption in buildings. The proposed industry-university collaborative research effort with Bosch will ensure that the technology and scientific contributions are steered toward innovative solutions that are practical for adoption in the market. Furthermore, the project will have significant diversity contributions by attracting minority students through collaboration with the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, a land-grant, historically black college with a diverse student body. Finally, a series of planned industry seminars, workshops and the publication of journal articles will allow further dissemination of the work.","title":"GOALI\/CPS:Medium:A Framework for Enabling Energy-Aware Smart Facilities","awardID":"0930868","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2014-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7918","name":"CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS)"}}],"PIcoPI":["488866","451785",420734,420735,420736,420737],"PO":["565274"]},"169559":{"abstract":"As software systems have grown in size, complexity and cost, it has become increasingly difficult to deliver software bug-free to end users, which result in many software failures during production runs at the user site.

To achieve the ambitious goal, the proposed research tightly integrates innovations from multiple layers: (1) Low-overhead operating and run-time system support to capture the failure moment without imposing large overhead during normal execution. (2) A novel, extensible, customizable, human-like failure diagnosis protocol. (3) Novel program analysis techniques that are specifically designed for on-site failure diagnosis.

One may seek a phrase in a file that is being manipulated by a text editor, a sentence on the web via a search engine, or a genome in the human DNA sequence. This basic tool has been well researched and, indeed, is ubiquitous in data processing. <br\/><br\/>However, string matching and motif discovery algorithms (\"Stringology\") that have dealt with searches in general databases, have always assumed that the sought string is ordered. The research thrusts were in directions such as exact matching, approximate matching, or grappling with the challenge of coping with errors in the data. But always the order of the data was assumed to be iron-clad. <br\/><br\/>Nevertheless, some non-conforming problems have been gnawing at the walls of this assumption. Some of the areas where applications assume erroneous order of the data are: Text Editing, where errors such as swaps or transpositions, assume that the data has not been changed -- it has rather been rearranged; Computational Biology, where reversals or transpositions of genome subsequences are part of the evolutionary process; and Linguistics, where the task of lexical categorization is aided by considering sets of parts-of-speech in various orders. <br\/><br\/>The above application areas suggest that the wonderfully ordered world of pattern matching may be too rigid to handle new challenges. This project introduces a fundamentally new model of string matching, where the order of symbols in the input pattern may be perturbed, but the content remains unchanged. This model studies unordered pattern matching universes in order to supply the above mentioned application areas with appropriate computational tools. A theory of unordered matching will give a general framework for all the above problems. <br\/><br\/>This project considers permuted Stringology as a line leading from fully ordered data all the way to data with no order at all. The ordered side has been historically amply researched. The specific technical goals of the project are: <br\/><br\/>1. To develop a theory and framework for permuted Stringology. <br\/>2. To identify the types of unordered problems that are more difficult than ordered Stringology, the conditions that make them harder, and the reason why. <br\/>3. To define the term ``Similarity'' in unordered clusters. <br\/>4. To define the world of ``almost ordered sequences'', and to compare it with unordered and ordered sequences. <br\/>5. To design tools that will be key elements in the solution for the proposed problems, and will be shared by more than one algorithm. The list of problems includes Indexing, Dictionary and Approximations. <br\/><br\/>This project's aim is to study the fundamental problems arising from a model of pattern matching with rearrangement. The immediate benefit to the field is a totally new, yet very basic, research direction that seems to defy the state-of-the-art toolkit. The historical tools of pattern matching, such as dynamic programming, FFT, sub-word trees, renaming, encodings, and embeddings do not seem suitable to handle these problems. New algorithmic tools and data structures are required. In fact, this direction already bore unexpected interesting fruits -- the solution of an open problem in graph theory posed by the mathematician Cayley in 1849! Techniques such as non-standard convolutions, group testing, and graph theoretic algorithms, have been necessary to solve some of the problems thus far. <br\/><br\/>Since this project defines a new model, there are many directions to explore. It is expected that this project will mark the beginning of intensive research in a new paradigm.","title":"AF: Medium: Collaborative Research: The Role of Order in Search","awardID":"0904246","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2014-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7926","name":"ALGORITHMS"}}],"PIcoPI":[401676],"PO":["565251"]},"150793":{"abstract":"As we move through our visual environment, the pattern of light that enters our eyes is strongly shaped by the properties of objects within the environment, their motion relative to each other, and our own motion relative to the external world.

The current information infrastructure is profoundly insecure in no small part due to the oblivious risk-seeking behaviors of nontechnical individuals online. The methods in this research are a combination of risk communication with intelligent interaction design. While the theory of risk communication has been embraced in computer security, its use is embryonic. The tools of intelligent interaction have not been adopted to assist individuals in making risk decisions appropriate to their contexts. By combining these approaches to specific online risks the research will enable individuals to make informed security choices. Note that this work specifically focuses work on the identified human individual as opposed to the commonly abstracted rational self-optimizing user. The core elements of the research are: 1) understanding the individual?s risk perception, 2) using that perception for effective risk communication, 3) ensuring the interruptions and communications are appropriate to the workflow at hand, and 4) providing risk mitigation that is automated and seamless. The innovative methods carry a high risk, but also a high payoff in potentially enabling the wide use of many discrete security tools. In this research, the knowledge-based approach to identification of technical risk will be integrated with a human-centered approach to the perception of risk to enable mitigation that is automated and contextually aware.<br\/><br\/>Using the results of our research, individuals will choose to take informed risks based on their on tasks, workflows and context.

Consequently, people innocently take risks they have no way of knowing how to avoid. To enable the nontechnical individual, this research project will embed a novel approach to simplifying the use of security measures. The proposed translucent design is enabled by this combination of reasoning about risk to interrupt the individual only when necessary, using workflow to build a coherent narrative that focuses on the risks and how to mitigate them in context, and combining the appropriate mitigating actions into simple customized macros.","title":"Collaborative Research: Intelligent Interactions with Risk Communication for Risk Mitigation","awardID":"0943382","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2011-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["537066"],"PO":["550147"]},"148925":{"abstract":"This project's goal is to acquire and develop an instrumented datacenter testbed spanning the three sites of the NSF Center for Autonomic Computing (CAC)-the University of Florida (UF), the University of Arizona (UA) and Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey (RU).

Annual energy and administration costs of today's datacenters amount to billions of dollars; high energy consumption also translates into excessive heat dissipation, which, in turn, increases cooling costs and increases servers' failure rates. The proposed testbed will enable a fundamental understanding of the operations of data centers and the autonomic control and management of their resources and services. The design of the underlying infrastructure reflects the natural heterogeneity, dynamism and distribution of real-world datacenters, and includes embedded instrumentation at all levels, including the platform, virtualization, middleware and application layers. Its scale and geographical distribution enables studies of challenges faced by datacenter applications, services, middleware and architectures related to both \"scale-up\" (increases in the capacity of individual servers) and \"scale-out\" (increases in the number of servers in the system). This testbed will enable fundamental and far-reaching research focused on cross-layer autonomics for managing and optimizing large-scale datacenters. The participant sites will contribute complementary expertise-UA at the resource level, UF at the virtualization layer, and RU in the area of services and applications. The collaboration between the university sites will bring coherence across ongoing separate research efforts and have a transformative impact on the modeling, formulation and solution of datacenter management problems, which have so far been considered mostly in terms of individual layers. <br\/>The testbed will also provide a critical infrastructure for education at multiple levels, including providing students with hands-on experience via course projects, enable development of new advanced multi-university and cross-disciplinary courses, as well as multi-site group projects focused on end-to-end autonomics, which will use the proposed testbed.

Because it was designed for throughput-oriented batch processing, Hadoop currently does not provide low-latency disk access necessary for real-time search. A distributed in-memory object caching architecture provides a potential solution to this problem.<br\/><br\/>To achieve broader impact, the results of this research will be implemented in Ivory, an open-source toolkit for distributed information retrieval built from the ground up with cluster architectures in mind. The availability of this toolkit will help sustain activities in the emerging area of \"cloud computing\".

Visualization, or the use of interactive graphics to support data analysis and understanding, has become an integral part and critical component of many application areas. VisWeek consists of three main events: IEEE Visualization (Vis), IEEE Information Visualization (InfoVis), and the IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology Symposium (VAST). IEEE Vis is the oldest of the three venues of VisWeek, and will celebrate its 20th anniversary this year. Its traditional focus has been on a wide range of topics in scientific and medical visualization. InfoVis centers around helping people explore or explain abstract data through interactive software that exploits the capabilities of the human perceptual system, focusing on cognitively useful spatial mappings of abstract datasets that are not inherently spatial, and accompanying the mappings with interaction techniques that allow people to intuitively explore the data. VAST, the youngest event, was founded in 2006 to address the growing interest in the science of analytical reasoning supported by highly interactive visual interfaces; its focus is on visual analytics tools and techniques to synthesize information into knowledge, derive insight from massive, dynamic, and often conflicting data; detect the expected and discover the unexpected, provide timely, defensible, and understandable assessments, and communicate assessments effectively for action. IEEE VisWeek is the premier forum for visualization advances in science and engineering for academia, government, and industry, bringing together about 800 researchers and practitioners from around the world with a shared interest in techniques, tools, and technology. The papers published in the special conference issue of IEEE Transactions of Visualization and Computer Graphics are rigorously refereed and widely cited.<br\/><br\/>The Doctoral Colloquium at IEEE VisWeek 2009 will bring together approximately 12 dissertation stage doctoral students in the field of visualization, from the United States and abroad, who will come together on Saturday, October 10, for a day of discussions and interaction with 6 faculty researchers, with follow-up events that will take place during the conference?s technical program. A primary goal of the colloquium is to allow students to discuss their research directions in a supportive atmosphere with a panel of distinguished leaders and with their peers, who will provide helpful feedback and fresh perspectives. The colloquium also supports community building, by connecting beginning and advanced researchers so as to build a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues across the world. Student research will be disseminated via posters during the VisWeek 2009 technical program, and via extended abstracts published in the VisWeek 2009 Extended Abstracts. Feedback about the Doctoral Colloquium will be provided to future conference committees. The PI has affirmed that in managing this event he and his colleagues will try explicitly to identify and include the broadest possible group of highly qualified participants, and that they will ensure that NSF funds are used chiefly to support participation by students enrolled in graduate programs in the United States.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The VisWeek Doctoral Colloquium has taken place annually at the Visualization conference since 2006, and has helped launch the careers of a number of outstanding young Vis researchers. It brings together the best of the next generation of visualization researchers, and allows them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers, which plays a major role in their enculturation into the profession. Since the students and faculty are a diverse group on several dimensions (nationality, scientific discipline, research specialization), the students' horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development.","title":"VisWeek 2009 Doctoral Colloquium","awardID":"0944249","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2010-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7453","name":"GRAPHICS & VISUALIZATION"}}],"PIcoPI":["486115"],"PO":["565227"]},"162687":{"abstract":"This collaborative workshop is being organized by Dr. Azer Bestavros, Boston University, and Dr. Magdy Nagi, Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Egypt, in order to identify opportunities for US-Middle East cooperation on networking infrastructures, technologies, and applications.

The global nature of this shared infrastructure poses important research and development challenges that must be addressed, including appropriate mechanisms for pooling resources and for designing regional testbeds and experimental infrastructures related to future generation networks.<br\/><br\/>Networking Technologies for Emerging Wireless and Ad-Hoc Applications: The wide penetration of smart devices in the Middle East region presents opportunities for the development of novel services and applications. Such services and applications may have significant economic impacts, as well as impacts on quality of life and emergency response. <br\/><br\/>Networking Support for Scalable and Secure Distributed Information Systems: Increasingly, networking researchers have been concerned with problems that go beyond traditional communication needs (e.g., transport and routing) to include network measurement and characterization, network security and privacy, information discovery, management, and mining in emerging social networks, among others. Localization (including multi-lingual and transliteration issues) will be addressed. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: The workshop will be organized as a peer-to-peer meeting of researchers from the US and the Middle East, with an emphasis on activities designed to facilitate tangible outcomes, including expanding existing collaborations, stimulating new research partnerships, and identifying priority areas for future research.

Due to limited human experience and capability, this manual design process severely impedes the design process of routing. The objective of this project is to bring a revolutionary change to this design process by building a highly flexible architecture, called Orchestra, for the automatic assembling and testing of a great variety of routing designs. Orchestra stores a large set of reusable \"genes\". Each gene is a small piece of computer code that implements a particular design for a small component of a routing system. The correctness of the \"genes\" and their mutual compatibility are automatically verified. Orchestra assembles various routing systems from verified \"genes\" and then tests them in both simulation and real environment. Based on the performance of the assembled protocols, Orchestra uses evolutionary algorithms to switch and tune designs of routing components to eventually identify the best design for a network setting.<br\/><br\/>Orchestra will greatly ease a network engineer's burden of implementing and evaluating an entire routing system. It can efficiently explore a much larger design space for routing systems than any single network engineer can. New areas for routing designs that are not explored by humans can be automatically discovered by Orchestra. The large collection of component designs in Orchestra will also provide a common platform for comparing and evaluating different design choices as well as serving education purposes.","title":"NeTs: An open architecture for the evolutionary design of routing protocols","awardID":"0916873","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2011-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":["494757","540088","521677"],"PO":["557315"]},"153778":{"abstract":"Collaboration, when it works, optimizes the contributions of individuals, often resulting in better decisions, outcomes, and experiences than individuals working alone.

CGs enable the modeling and analysis of the dynamics that result when rational, selfish parties interact in an attempt to minimize the individual costs they incur to secure the shared cloud resources necessary to support their application QoS or SLA requirements. CGs offer an attractive alternative to approaches that require such parties to trust cloud providers (who may have conflicting incentives), or those that expect such parties to be altruistic or to accept best-effort approaches that do not guarantee performance isolation. In addition to developing the analytical underpinnings of CGs and variants thereof, this project involves the implementation and experimental evaluation of some of these variants for cloud infrastructures, paving the way for the development of a revolutionary distributed resource management alternative for autonomic, self-organizing systems, in which the adoption of a global optimization approach (centralized or distributed) would be neither practical nor justifiable.

Ubiquitous users without preexisting trust relationships have posed a challenge of cooperative resource sharing. These facts necessitate that the issues of resource management (resMgt) and trust management (trustMgt) be addressed in order to ensure the successful deployment of LSDS. However, these two issues are typically addressed separately, despite the significant interdependencies between them: resMgt needs trustMgt to provide a cooperative environment for resource sharing, and in turn facilitates trustMgt to evaluate node multi-faceted trustworthiness in providing various resources. This proposal is aimed at integrating resMgt and trustMgt through the development of a distributed software architecture. The proposed project is built on two key innovations. (1) Lightweight multi-resource management. Unlike most previous multi-resource management approaches that depend on multiple infrastructures and incurring high overhead, or one infrastructure but causing bottlenecks, the project involves a single hierarchically integrated infrastructure without bottlenecks. (2) Integrated multi-faceted trust management. Unlike most previous trustMgt approaches that may not provide correct guidance for resource selection by assigning a node a single trust value for providing all resources, the project offers multi-faceted trust evaluation across multiple resources. Furthermore, it facilitates interaction between trustMgt and resMgt.","title":"CSR-DMSS, SM, Harmony: Efficient Integrated Resource\/Trust Management in Large-Scale Distributed Systems","awardID":"1025649","effectiveDate":"2009-10-28","expirationDate":"2011-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7371","name":"CYBER TRUST"}}],"PIcoPI":["563519"],"PO":["535244"]},"150964":{"abstract":"Networks are a natural, powerful, and versatile tool representing the structure of complex systems and have been widely used in many disciplines, ranging from sociology to physics to biology.

One may seek a phrase in a file that is being manipulated by a text editor, a sentence on the web via a search engine, or a genome in the human DNA sequence. This basic tool has been well researched and, indeed, is ubiquitous in data processing.<br\/><br\/>However, string matching and motif discovery algorithms (\"Stringology\") that have dealt with searches in general databases, have always assumed that the sought string is ordered. The research thrusts were in directions such as exact matching, approximate matching, or grappling with the challenge of coping with errors in the data. But always the order of the data was assumed to be iron-clad.<br\/><br\/>Nevertheless, some non-conforming problems have been gnawing at the walls of this assumption. Some of the areas where applications assume erroneous order of the data are: Text Editing, where errors such as swaps or transpositions, assume that the data has not been changed -- it has rather been rearranged; Computational Biology, where reversals or transpositions of genome subsequences are part of the evolutionary process; and Linguistics, where the task of lexical categorization is aided by considering sets of parts-of-speech in various orders.<br\/><br\/>The above application areas suggest that the wonderfully ordered world of pattern matching may be too rigid to handle new challenges. This project introduces a fundamentally new model of string matching, where the order of symbols in the input pattern may be perturbed, but the content remains unchanged. This model studies unordered pattern matching universes in order to supply the above mentioned application areas with appropriate computational tools. A theory of unordered matching will give a general framework for all the above problems.<br\/><br\/>This project considers permuted Stringology as a line leading from fully ordered data all the way to data with no order at all. The ordered side has been historically amply researched. The specific technical goals of the project are:<br\/><br\/>1. To develop a theory and framework for permuted Stringology.<br\/>2. To identify the types of unordered problems that are more difficult than ordered Stringology, the conditions that make them harder, and the reason why.<br\/>3. To define the term ``Similarity'' in unordered clusters.<br\/>4. To define the world of ``almost ordered sequences'', and to compare it with unordered and ordered sequences.<br\/>5. To design tools that will be key elements in the solution for the proposed problems, and will be shared by more than one algorithm. The list of problems includes Indexing, Dictionary and Approximations.<br\/><br\/>This project's aim is to study the fundamental problems arising from a model of pattern matching with rearrangement. The immediate benefit to the field is a totally new, yet very basic, research direction that seems to defy the state-of-the-art toolkit. The historical tools of pattern matching, such as dynamic programming, FFT, sub-word trees, renaming, encodings, and embeddings do not seem suitable to handle these problems. New algorithmic tools and data structures are required. In fact, this direction already bore unexpected interesting fruits -- the solution of an open problem in graph theory posed by the mathematician Cayley in 1849! Techniques such as non-standard convolutions, group testing, and graph theoretic algorithms, have been necessary to solve some of the problems thus far.<br\/><br\/>Since this project defines a new model, there are many directions to explore. It is expected that this project will mark the beginning of intensive research in a new paradigm.","title":"AF: Medium: Collaborative Research: The Role of Order in Search","awardID":"0904581","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2014-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7926","name":"ALGORITHMS"}}],"PIcoPI":[401872],"PO":["565251"]},"170557":{"abstract":"Many technological innovations are designed to increase operator safety by simplifying tasks and user demands in safety-critical situations. However, operators may actually adapt to these systems in unexpected ways that may counteract the intended outcome. In this research, the PI will develop a statistical methodology for predicting operator adaptation to prolonged system use. The test bed application providing the concrete framework for development of the methodology will derive from the driving domain, where a number of safety based systems have already been installed. Driving involves complex interactions between the driver, the vehicle, and the environment, and any breakdowns in these interactions can undermine driving safety. The objective will be achieved through five major components: development of a representative model of operators' adaptive behavior as influenced by technology; quantification of the initiating factors of operator adaptation on system safety by comparing the responses from a field operation test of short term adaptive cruise control (ACC) users with an on-road study of long-term ACC users; acquisition of an understanding how mediating factors and perceptions influence adaptive behavior using surveys distributed to drivers who have used ACC for extended periods; identification of the safety critical situations where adaptive behavior may have negative consequences using a driving simulator study designed to capture collision likely events; and development of a predictive model of adaptation that results from prolonged system use with time-based regression models. The intellectual merit of this project centers on the integration of theory and data to advance our knowledge of adaptive strategies and how that influences system use in unintended ways. The research will extend prior work of the PI and demonstrate why objective and subjective measures are needed to further understand how a person's behavior changes as they interact with intelligent systems. To understand how and why people adapt to information provided by innovative technologies that are continually changing, an understanding of the user's intentions and motivations is needed; the PI plans to fill this gap with time-dependent analyses which have traditionally been limited in human-factors research. Project outcomes will advance our knowledge of the adaptive behavior process, such that those behaviors that counteract the intended benefits of safety systems can be predicted and therefore allow for more robust, effective, and efficient systems to be designed.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: Systems that account for the changing strategies of drivers will be more effective in reducing the number of crashes and fatalities in the world. This research will connect the range of applications for analytical techniques used across engineering, econometrics, statistics, and epidemiology. The research activities will be integrated into two graduate courses developed by the PI that focus on designing systems centered on human performance, and analytical methods in human factors engineering, and the PI further plans a variety of outreach activities intended for K-12 students as well as teenage drivers.","title":"CAREER: Modeling the effect of operators' adaptive behavior on system safety","awardID":"1027609","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2013-12-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[456552],"PO":["565227"]},"160657":{"abstract":"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). <br\/><br\/><br\/>This project will explore alternative parallelization techniques for very largescale data intensive<br\/>applications on emerging new parallel architectures, including distributed memory computer<br\/>clusters using multicore and GPGPU processors.

Knowledge of prevalent connectivity patterns will also shed light on the developmental constraints and learning rules under which the network might be operating. <br\/><br\/>Recent developments open new possibilities for collaborative efforts to tackle this basic problem. First, advances in two-photon imaging and photostimulation methods make it possible to observe the simultaneous activity of large ensembles of neurons, while stimulating neurons in arbitrary spatiotemporal patterns. Second, new statistical methods for extracting action potential timing information from calcium imaging data, and for modeling the response properties of small collections of neurons, are now efficient enough that they may be implemented on-line and scaled up to understand the function of large networks. <br\/><br\/>The investigators will combine these new experimental and analytical methods to estimate, for the first time, the connectivity diagram of large neocortical circuits, using two-photon calcium imaging of spontaneous and evoked activity in thalamocortical slices.

Object recognition technology is pervasive in a broad range of applications, such as safety and law enforcement, defense and security, autonomous navigation, industrial manufacturing, business process and e-commerce. The proposed transformative research provides a foundational framework for predicting the performance of object recognition algorithms based on probabilities and structural characteristics of the models and data. In contrast to previous work, the proposed research considers not only the data distortion factors but also the model similarity. The performance is explicitly modeled as a function of data distortion factors (feature uncertainty, occlusion and clutter) and model factors (similarity) so that one can ultimately characterize the probability distribution of performance rather than the empirical results on a specific dataset. The research will focus in three areas: 1) Developing the Bayesian formulation of performance prediction and bounds on performance. 2) Analyzing the effects of all of the assumptions made in the performance prediction approach; evaluating the effects of mathematical tractability, complexity and the gain in performance and validating different assumptions based on real data. 3) Generating results of the approach for practical applications. The development of scientific theory, prediction and computational models for recognition will result in the development of systematic approaches to the design of recognition systems that can reliably achieve predictable results in complex real-world, and contribute towards the science of computer-based object recognition.","title":"RI: Small: Performance Prediction and Validation for Object Recognition","awardID":"0915270","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2013-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":[408807,"553703"],"PO":["564316"]},"153819":{"abstract":"A long term goal motivating this project is the development of a universal computational engine to support reasoning across different applications of intelligent systems (e.g., planning and diagnosis).

Certain queries, which are generally intractable, become tractable on the compiled NNF forms. To implement a task like planning or diagnosis, all one needs to do is compile their knowledge base to the most succinct subset of NNF that provides polytime support for the queries required by the task. The project will focus in particular on algorithms for imposing various conditions on NNF compilations, using both top-down and bottom-up compilation techniques, to support a larger set of tractable forms.

DARPA reports very positive results from its competition wherein teams who developed fully automated automobiles, the automation attained by new methods in sensing and artificial intelligence, competed for prizes and glory. <br\/><br\/>The security challenge, the focus of this proposal, is to be run in conjunction with USENIX Security, 2009. Particularly challenging for a security challenge wherein a team has to defend itself against attacks, is the need for a clear, well-specified set of rules which unambiguously define criteria for success and for choosing a winner. <br\/><br\/>For this challenge, the task of the participant teams is to build a system such that the provided servers are self-defending and resilient against attacks. During the competition an automated scoring system will record the services that remain functional. At the same time, an automated attack system will perform disruptive attacks against the services.<br\/><br\/>Prizes, provided by private companies, will be awarded to the teams whose servers provide the highest service level but also above a minimal threshold.<br\/><br\/>Together with Nicholas Weaver (ICSI) and Anup Ghosh (GMU), the PI has created the infrastructure required to run the competition, including the attacking and scoring systems. <br\/><br\/>The funds requested would be used to reimburse the expenses of graduate and undergraduate students participating in the competition.

This collaborative project will quantify motion within natural scenes, record activity from populations of neurons in the early visual pathway in response to the motion, and develop models of motion representation across neuronal populations. The primary goals of the work are to fully characterize the biological representation of motion in natural scenes in the early stages of visual processing that sets the stage for cortical computation critical for visual perception, and to unify the biological findings with computational models of motion from the computer vision community. <br\/><br\/>The perception of visual motion is critical for both biological and computer vision systems. Motion reveals structure of the world including the relative and absolute depths of objects, surface boundaries between objects and information about ego-motion and the independent motion of other objects. The effects of visual motion on the relationship between spatially localized and global properties of the natural visual scene, and how this is represented by the early visual pathway of the brain, are largely unknown. <br\/><br\/>This project addresses the computation of local and global properties of natural visual scenes by both distributed neural systems and computer vision algorithms using a novel set of complex naturalistic stimuli in which ground truth properties of the scene are known, and all aspects of the scene, including its reflectance, surface properties, lighting and motion are under investigator control. A unified probabilistic modeling framework will be adopted, that ties together the computational and biological models of properties of the natural scene. Neural activity will be recorded from a large population of densely sampled single neurons from the visual thalamus. From the perspective of the computer vision community, an important challenge exists in inferring the motion of the external environment (or \"optical flow\") from sequences of 2D images. From the perspective of the neuroscience community, quantifying the distributed neural representation of luminance and motion in the early visual pathway will be a critical step in understanding how scene information is extracted and prepared for processing in higher visual centers. A team of investigators with experience in computer science, engineering, and neuroscience will develop a theoretical foundation and rich set of methods for the representation and recovery of local luminance, local motion boundaries and global motion by brains and machines.","title":"Collaborative Research: Neural and computational models of spatio-temporally varying natural scenes","awardID":"0904875","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2012-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7327","name":"CRCNS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["498150"],"PO":["564318"]},"161609":{"abstract":"Objective: The Workshop on the Frontiers of Controls, Games and Network Science will host participants from academia, industry and government.

Led by faculty in computer science, computer information systems, management information systems and mathematics, this project will create a cultural shift among faculty in multiple areas of study. Faculty from these varied departments are serving on the advisory committee for this planning project and have agreed to pilot threads that introduce computational thinking into their courses: physics, biology, education, graphic design, petroleum engineering and theater. <br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activities <br\/>At a small liberal arts institution, the dependence of each discipline on another is perhaps more pronounced than at larger institutions. Rather than creating discipline-specific computer curricula, professors in most other disciplines rely on the computer science department to offer courses that provide a strong base for computational learning. The expectation is that as students develop mastery within their disciplines, they will be able to integrate this knowledge with their computational skills, which will strengthen their ability to manage information, and enable them to transition to increasingly higher levels of discovery and comprehension. The intellectual merit of this CPATH project stems from its focus on revising basic computer courses to emphasize computational thinking, and integrating computational thinking as a method that informs learning across many disciplines. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts of the Proposed Activities <br\/>The broader impact of this CPATH planning project is evident in three elements: campus-wide involvement, community outreach, and piloting threads of computational thinking (CT) in non-computer courses. Faculty and staff from any discipline are invited to explore the concept of computational thinking by participating in workshops, attending presentations and\/or serving on a CT project advisory committee. Through creative road shows and summer learning opportunities, middle and high school students are being introduced to CT. An introduction to CT is being added to in-service math teachers? workshops at the college. Faculty in at least two and perhaps as many as six other disciplines are piloting efforts to introduce CT within their courses. The anticipated project outcomes include broadening fluency with computational thinking among faculty at Marietta College and among math teachers in the K-12 educational community; revision of two key computer courses to create a stronger alignment with computational thinking for first year computer students; and increasing excitement about and awareness of the myriad uses for computational thinking among K-12 youth.

Important aspects of this project is the identification of key CT skills and competencies critical at each point along the K through 14 education continuum; assessment tools for accurately measuring acquisition of CT skills; and the small-scale pilot of infusion strategies to test the promise of the model. <br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit <br\/>For over a decade, concern has continued to rise over the relative lack of enrollment and completion in STEM programs, particularly at the University level. All segments of education have tried in various ways to address the leaks in the STEM pipeline, but without significant success. This project is implementing a strategy that uses CT skills as both a solution for these long-standing problems and as a measure of the project's success, emphasizing the higher education success and output to industry. There are compelling challenges to address, including a cultural change rate that requires unprecedented agility on the part of education as it prepares for its input audience (students). At the earliest stages, education will need to adjust its curriculum, classroom pedagogy and pace to advance its students through this first section of the pipeline. With better prepared incoming students, the community college can do a more thorough job of moving STEM students into the course material and practical experiences which will help assure their sustained interest in the field. The interest of universities who receive inputs from community colleges is that students are prepared for the challenges of the next level of study, and are focused enough to complete their chosen program. Business and industry rightly expect candidates for their open positions who are work ready, and possess the CT skills (and others) that will make them a good investment. <br\/><br\/>Another portion of the pipeline that has been somewhat neglected is the end, where these long-term investments drop off the STEM grid. Businesses, educational institutions, and government agencies work hard to create intellectual capital in their employees, only to see them disappear with many potential years of productive work life still ahead of them. This commodity is quite expensive to replace, and may require years to accomplish. Businesses and other employers who have been part of the Sacramento Regional CPATH Team meetings agree that they have serious challenges with losing out on these investments just when they need them most. A goal of this project is to assist employers, through interaction within the project team, to address their retention needs through innovative approaches to optimizing these investments. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts <br\/>This project effectively engages CPATH partners in a collaborative development process that will endure long into the future as the technology landscape continues to change. The output of this collaboration will not only be a plan for infusion of CT skill to address the needs of an accelerating technological economy, but also to secure relationships which will support adaptation of this plan to address emerging needs. The project team is cooperating to be agile, effective and efficient in maintaining the integrity of the K through 14 pipeline for CT-skilled workers. This project has the potential to benefit a wide range of stakeholders to include the K-12, community college, and university systems within the greater Sacramento region as well as other portions of northern California (through dissemination strategies); information technology employers, and the residents of the region in general as broad transformation will lead to increased talent and economic competitiveness. It is significant that this project includes activities at the K-12, community college, and university levels, maximizing the reach of the project to include a large and highly diverse student population. The instructional models and new ways of thinking about computing that are expected to result from this project will lead to increased enrollment in computing programs in Los Rios and Sacramento State. This will help to increase the diversity of the computing workforce in the region.","title":"CPATH-1: Sacramento Regional CPATH Project II","awardID":"0939168","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2013-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7640","name":"CPATH"}}],"PIcoPI":["458623","564476"],"PO":["564181"]},"154060":{"abstract":"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111- 5).<br\/><br\/>Abstract (NSF 0917087):<br\/><br\/>Wireless networks operate under hostile conditions and often exhibit multi-scale stochastic dynamics.

Reaching students early in their undergraduate career ensures that students are prepared with the CT skills that they need to pursue graduate studies and that are highly desirable for future employment. Because CT skills will be so integral to the 21st century workplace, this project begins by developing two lower-level CT courses to be integrated into the general education curriculum for all BS degree students ? approximately 80% of the Carroll College student body. <br\/>To round out the college?s computational offerings, they are developing undergraduate minor and major programs in computational science. The computational courses developed through the proposed minor program will serve as a common area for collaboration among faculty from different fields. The major and minor programs will also allow students who have an interest in computational science to explore a variety of applications while learning the theory behind the techniques. Finally, the project team is integrating computational techniques into the student learning experience as a whole.

Security properties for many cryptographic techniques are based, provably, on simple computational assumptions (such as the hardness of factoring), with strong proofs. Symmetric cryptography algorithms such as blockciphers and hash functions are typically designed without the benefit of strong proofs of security. There is good reason for this: for these algorithms especially, speed is an essential concern, and provable security tends to be attached to heavy computational methods such as modular exponentiation. Nonetheless, symmetric cryptographic algorithms do seem to be secure, able to resist all known attacks. This project seeks to expand on our theoretical understanding of the structural design principles underlying popular symmetric algorithms, with a particular focus on how these structures are able to strengthen simple building blocks into secure algorithms.<br\/><br\/>The research is driven by four central principles: (1) Focus on structures -- by considering the structures used in practice that connect simple components, rather than the lowest-level constructions themselves, results will apply to a wide range of potential designs. (2) Minimize assumptions -- the research must be aggressive in modeling underlying components as weak, so as to understand how they are strengthened by the structures that use them. (3) Avoid asymptotics -- in practice, a security parameter must be chosen and fixed, and asymptotic guarantees of security are of little comfort. Favor precise analysis and avoid inherently asymptotic scenarios like assuming computational limitations. (4) Focus on positive results -- while negative results (that is, attacks) inform the development of positive solutions, this is an area in which negative results are already far more advanced than positive ones. The research focuses mainly on blockcipher design and hash function design and connections between them.","title":"CAREER: Principles of Design in Symmetric Cryptography","awardID":"0845662","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2010-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["454038"],"PO":["565264"]},"159265":{"abstract":"This CISE special project award funds the core operations of the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the National Academy of Sciences.

Financial markets are critical to the nation?s economic health; the current turmoil in the economy has been driven by instability in the country?s financial markets. The need to track, monitor, and analyze the large number of transactions in modern markets drives the use of cutting edge computer science and information technology in financial market regulation. Also, a large portion of American undergraduate students major or minor in fields related to business, public policy, and finance. This provides a large potential audience to learn the relevance and appeal of computational thinking. <br\/>This project is integrating computational thinking as an essential theme in teaching students in computing, business, public policy, economics, mathematics, and the social sciences about financial markets. The University at Albany is home to the Center for Financial Market Regulation and has the nation?s first undergraduate major and minor in Financial Market Regulation. These programs are the focus in the development of a new computational thinking curriculum. Over a two-year period, the researchers on this proposal are engaging government and industry regulators in developing a set of learning objectives that will drive the creation of problem-based undergraduate curricula ? first for courses in the financial market regulation programs, and then in other undergraduate programs across the campus, including computing. The end result of this work will be cases, modules, and courses that provide an attractive interdisciplinary learning environment in which students become interested and proficient in computational thinking and understand its importance to society. <br\/>Intellectual Merit. The various disciplines that contribute to financial market regulation are all mature fields, and are well represented as academic programs. A major innovation of this work is the explicit integration of the multidisciplinary partners using computational thinking as a central focus. This is possible due to the expertise that the personnel in this proposal bring from their research and educational experience in the component disciplines, working together in multidisciplinary teams, partnering with non-academic experts, and designing effective and enjoyable learning environments for students. In addition, this work is investigating how experts in the applied field of financial market regulation conceive of critical computational problems and the thinking skills most relevant to their solution. Finally, this work is examining the efficacy of problem-based learning curricula for the development of computational thinking in financial market regulation. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts. Recent events have shown that the nation?s economic health depends on developing effective regulatory, surveillance, and oversight systems for our financial markets. The industry has been divided into front-room operations staffed with sales, business, and legal professionals and back-room operations staffed with IT and other quantitative professionals, but now sees the need to integrate these multiple disciplines and acknowledges the need for computational thinking in all aspects of business strategy. The same holds true for industry and government regulators. Enabling students to learn about the role of computational thinking in the financial markets ? in particular its importance in regulation and oversight ? will promote a workforce that helps the United States build more effective regulatory and risk management systems that will grow our economy and provide a safe environment for investors. Further, this approach to fostering computational thinking in an applied context can serve as a model for similar programs in other domains, and help diversify the pool of students learning advanced computational thinking.","title":"CPATH-2: Learning Computational Thinking in Context: Using Problems and Cases in Financial Market Regulation","awardID":"0939137","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2013-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1709","name":"CISE EDUCAT RES & CURRIC DEVEL"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7640","name":"CPATH"}}],"PIcoPI":["551443","551444","551446",425216,425217],"PO":["564181"]},"148970":{"abstract":"The objective of this research is to develop and deploy a cluster testbed hosting multiple terabytes of collective memory.

The approach is to quantify the control degradation in terms of response time, thereby tying computer responsiveness to the controlled process performance and use such cost functions to effectively manage computational resources. Similarly, control strategies can be adjusted so as to be responsive to computational state. Unmanned aircraft will be used as vehicles to demonstrate our approach.<br\/>The intellectual merit of this research is that it takes disparate fields, control and computation, and builds formal abstractions in both the computation-to-control and control-to-computation directions. These abstractions are grounded in terms of physical reality (e.g., time, fuel, energy) and encapsulate in a form comprehensible and meaningful to each domain, the relevant attributes of the other domain. <br\/>This research is important because cyber-physical systems are playing an increasing role in all walks of life. It will allow design approaches to be systematic and efficient rather than ad hoc. It is based on a large body of our prior work that has begun to successfully bridge the representational and algorithmic gap that separates the control and computer science & engineering communities. Dissemination of results will be by means of courses in our universities, instructional materials, research and tutorial publications and industry collaboration (e.g., General Motors R&D).

This requires computational models for accurate estimation of how a driver perceives situations, plans actions, and reacts and interacts with the vehicle and its surround. The specific goal of the project is to develop computational frameworks to analyze attention shifts, using multimodal cues, in an environment where time and safety constraints are critical. Specific research objectives are: (1) Identification of body related indicators of attention switching. This involves utilizing statistical machine-learning algorithms to analyze previously collected ethnographic datasets and determine most useful indicators of attention shifts, including head and eye gaze, hands, feet, and other body motions. (2) Understanding the effect of external visual and audio saliency cues in the driving environment on attention shifts. This involves the analysis of how those multimodal cues affect attention shifts in time- and safety-critical situations, incorporating ?top-down? goal-oriented and ?bottom-up? distraction-based mechanisms. (3) Developing a hierarchical Bayesian model and computational framework for describing the relationship between body cues, external saliency, and driving task, in order to accurately estimate attention and attention shifts. In summary, the project provides a feasibility assessment of detecting how and why attention shifts occur in the vehicular environment with a multimodal sensor suite. Project findings will influence design of active safety systems to reduce crash risk on the roads.","title":"Understanding Attention Switching with Visual and Audio Cues in Time-Safety Critical Situations","awardID":"0958033","effectiveDate":"2009-10-01","expirationDate":"2011-09-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":[434470],"PO":["564316"]},"162480":{"abstract":"This research seeks to accelerate simulation of quantum circuits through symbolic and numerical techniques.

This research targets high-end computing (HEC) users, who manage billions of files generated by measurement devices, experimentation, or scientific workflows. The techniques and system developed are also applicable to general-purpose computing. <br\/><br\/>Realizing this goal requires advances in several areas. First, the project is designing and developing fast, scalable mechanisms to gather, maintain and index the large volume of metadata and provenance that HEC applications and users generate. This project is also exploring search algorithms that operate on graph structures, enabling users to find files \"near\" their current workspace.
