In the current incarnation of the MBone tools, a separate application handles each media (e.g.,for audio,for video, and for whiteboard) and together these tools comprise a flexible multi-party communication system that scales to roughly 1000 participants. This NSF CAREER proposal builds upon this previous work on the MBone tools with a new emphasis on massive scalability. A principal goal is to design new end-to-end protocols complemented by new network services that will facilitate multi-party communication systems that scale to millions of hosts. At this extreme, ``multicast for the masses''becomes a reality. If successful,the traditional infrastructures for mainstream mass media ---e.g., analog cable networks and over the air radio broadcasts ---can be replaced by integrated packet-switched networks running highly scalable multicast protocols. The proposed approach for achieving this thousand-fold improvement in scalability is multifaceted. Initially, the investigator will design minimal but powerful extensions to the IP Multicast service model that will provide end hosts with more flexible mechanisms for exploiting the underlying network topology. In the current Internet architecture, network topology is deliberately hidden. While this has led to robust protocols and robust networks, it places fundamental scaling restrictions on end-to-end multicast protocols. Instead, the proposed work will investigate whether a properly modified IP Multicast service model can enable new end-to-end protocols that scale to the extreme degree proposed herein. One particularly promising extension to IP Multicast is a new forwarding service called subtree multicast or subcast. Subcasts provide the topol ogically-aware network localization that end-to-end protocols require in order to scale gracefully. Whereas a normal multicast packet is sent to every receiver in a target multicast group, a subcast packet is sent only to a well-defined, localized subset of the group. Leveraging subtree multicast, the proposed work aims to overcome many of the scaling limitations in current end-to-end multicast protocols, and in particular, seeks a new, subcast-based design for the local recovery component of modern reliable multicast transport protocols. But, more generally, subcasts hold the promise to have far-reaching impact on a number of end-to-end multicast protocols (e.g., announce\/listen protocols like RTCP, session directory protocols, multicast address allocation schemes, congestion control probes as RLM, and distributed voting algorithms like SCUBA),and the proposed work will investigate the integration of subcasts into these existing protocols as well as new ones. Research prototypes based on subcast technology will be fielded in real, ``production'' environments and integrated to the extent possible into the proposed educational activities. To this end, the investigator will develop on-line curricula that utilizes an experimental webcast system to deliver course content over the network, for example, to students in their dormitories, homes, or offices. The resulting applications and tools will also be deployed in a ``distance-learning classroom'', currenty under development at U.C. Berkeley, which houses classes, seminars, and research group meetings. To realize this ambitious goal, the proposed project will integrate artifacts and infrastructure from the MASH multimedia networking project at U.C. Berkeley and other similar efforts in the network research community that are investigating and building new multicast applications and protocols.","title":"CAREER: Multicast for the Masses: Scaling the Internet Multicast Service","awardID":"9734515","effectiveDate":"1998-03-15","expirationDate":"2002-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["96209"],"PO":["565090"]},"28033":{"abstract":"This research addresses the problems of detection and recognition of deformable articulated shapes, such as people and animals, from real images.

Objects are represented in a tree-graph structure derived from a shape axis model. The information stored in the nodes include probabilities, used to specify likely geometric deformations of the object and of the imaging function. The tree-graph structure allows for a description of occlusions and articulations in terms of tree matching operations.

The goal of this project is to distribute logic within memory systems so that some computations can be performed in the memory system without transferring data to the processor. By fabricating field-programmable gate arrays and memory on the same chip, computations for fine-grained data manipulation can be distributed to the memory system at run time to speed up specific applications.A crucial research issue in such a design is the partitioning of computations between high-performance processors and the distributed logic. This project is investigating this partitioning on a range of appilications, including integer programming for compiler register allocation, filters for image and video editing, internet routing, graph matching for intrusion detection, and protein sequence matching. Educational plans include the updating of several existing courses in computer architecture, the development of new courses in reconfigurable computing, and the incorporation of undergraduate research into the project. Expected outcomes of this project include a methodology for designing reconfigurable memory systems and using them in computations, an infrastructure of simulation tools and hardware prototypes, students trained in applications-driven system design, and web-based educational software to support collaborative projects in computer architecture. ***","title":"CAREER: Care and Feeding of High-Performance Processors with Reconfigurable Memory Systems","awardID":"9733475","effectiveDate":"1998-03-15","expirationDate":"2004-02-29","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"4715","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["486140"],"PO":["113883"]},"26733":{"abstract":"This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's \"Connections to the Internet\" announcement, NSF 96-64.

Accurate characterization of these streams is essential to devising efficient resource allocation strategies that guarantee acceptable QoS without underutilizing network capacity. This project is focused on characterizing compressed video traffic and investigating resource allocation schemes for transporting video traffic over computer networks. New traffic models for VBR video streams will be developed under three strongly related compression algorithms: JPEG, MPEG-1, and MPEG-2. The modeling methodology will be based on the class of M\/G\/infinity processes, whose versatility will be exploited to capture various forms of traffic correlations. Video sources (single and aggregated) will be characterized at both an entry node and after being multiplexed with other streams (i.e., the departure traffic from a multiplexer). Models for the various layers in hierarchically encoded MPEG-2 video will be developed. The multiplexing performance under video models will be investigated. Corresponding resource allocation strategies for transporting video traffic over broadband networks will be developed. The impact of correlations persistence on the queueing performance under video traffic will be investigated. Several priority scheduling strategies at a multiplexer that is fed by several MPEG-2 input streams will be studied. In connection with the proposed research program, several educational goals will be pursued. New courses on broadband multimedia networks which integrate in their curricula several aspects of the PI's research agenda will be developed. The pedagogical approach in these courses will be a balanced mix of theory and practice and will combine classroom instruction with research-oriented semester projects, hence exposing students (graduate and senior undergraduate) to the intriguing realm of research. Team work will be strongly encouraged in course projects, as it prepares students to future work environments in industry. In an effort to outreach to industry, networking courses taught by the PI will be broadcast over the VideoCampus facility to several industrial sites in the area, allowing many interested engineers and managers to take these courses on their premises. The PI plans to organize a weekly seminar on various topics in networks research, which will feature presentations given by students, faculty, and invited speakers from industry and academia.","title":"CAREER: Traffic Characterization and Resource Allocation for Transporting Video Streams Over Broadband Networks","awardID":"9733143","effectiveDate":"1998-03-15","expirationDate":"2002-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["540507"],"PO":["234222"]},"24137":{"abstract":"This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's \"Connections to the Internet\" announcement, NSF 96-64.

However, provisioning network resources accurately is quite challenging in the real-world environment characterized by heterogeneous and highly bursty traffic streams which exhibit rate variations over multiple time scales. The goal of this research is to design accurate and robust admission control and resource management algorithms that scale to large internetworks. In particular, we plan to study the following three problems. First, in a shared public network, applications cannot be trusted to adhere to their specified traffic parameters and therefore must be policed. However, deterministic policing must not preclude statistical resource sharing, which is essential for efficient resource utilization. We are designing an accurate envelope-based resource allocation algorithm that enables the network to statistically multiplex traffic streams while simultaneously enforcing applications' specified traffic parameters. Second, many applications will be unable to specify their traffic parameters in advance so that the network must somehow reserve resources even for applications with unknown resource requirements. We are developing a measurement-based service that adaptively measures the envelope of the aggregate traffic flow to predict future resource requirements and performance parameters for such ill-characterized applications. Finally, internetworks are characterized by a large number of heterogeneous components so that a resource management scheme must scale to such realistic environments. We are devising end-to-end resource management techniques that exploit coarse-grained representation and allocation of network resources.","title":"CAREER: Accurate and Robust Admission Control in Integrated Services Networks","awardID":"9733610","effectiveDate":"1998-03-01","expirationDate":"2003-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["548310"],"PO":["194325"]},"26725":{"abstract":"This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's \"Connections to the Internet\" announcement, NSF 96-64.

Under this contract, the super-server grants a user a referral to where a copy of the requested file may be retrieved in exchange for her assurance to serve other users for a specified period of time. In this proposed project, we will investigate issues that must be resolved in order to make pseudo-serving an effective tool for dissipating flash-crowds on the Internet.

This series of meetings has become a regular event for the region, with different academic and industrial institutions hosting the meeting in rotation. The purpose of this meeting is to stimulate interest in and enhance understanding of the technical aspects of computer algebra, by providing a way for those in the region who are active or interested in becoming more active in computer algebra to meet with each other in an inexpensive and easily accessible way. This meeting is more informal than the annual ISSAC meetings, with ample time for unstructured interaction. Participation by the region's graduate students is particularly encouraged through special invitation to contribute to the poster sessions, and through travel support. Three invited lectures will anchor the meeting and will help attract participants. The invited talks and poster sessions contributed by the community will cover the breadth of computer algebra: algorithms, software, and applications.","title":"East Coast Computer Algebra Day, April 25, l998, U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, MD","awardID":"9807850","effectiveDate":"1998-03-15","expirationDate":"1999-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2865","name":"NUMERIC, SYMBOLIC & GEO COMPUT"}}],"PIcoPI":[80495,"563334"],"PO":["187585"]},"23915":{"abstract":"Project Homepage: http:\/\/www.cs.purdue.edu\/homes\/park\/nsf-ncr-9714707.html Abstract: Recent measurements of local area and wide area traffic have shown that network traffic is self-similar or fractal, i.e., the measured time series is bursty across several time scales. This phenomenon has been shown to be ubiquitous with potentially dire consequences to network performance due to the scale-invariant nature of burstiness. This project investigates effective traffic control algorithms, architectures, and mechanisms for facilitating efficient resource utilization while providing quality of service to real-time and best-effort traffic streams under self-similar traffic conditions. The project builds on recent work which characterizes the causal aspects of traffic self-similarity and shows that scale-invariant burstiness can be highly detrimental to network performance. In a nutshell, it is shown that self-similarity of traffic flow is an intrinsic property of networked client\/server systems which communicate files or objects of very large size with nonnegligible frequency. The latter is known, technically, as the heavy-tailed property of file or object size distributions which is evidenced in actual distributed systems including UNIX file systems. On the performance side, it is shown that conjoint provision of low delay and high throughput is adversely affected by self-similarity. We follow a three-pronged method of attack for managing self-similar traffic, the first two based on dynamic control of traffic flow, and the third being of a structural nature where resources are architected and apportioned under direct control. The first method, predictive feedback control, is geared toward exploiting the long-range correlation structure present in self-similar traffic for congestion control purposes. We identify the on-set of concentrated periods of either high or low traffic activity - a distinguishing characteristic of scale-invaria nt burstiness - and adjust the mode of congestion control appropriately from conservative to aggressive. Being able to predict the onset of persistent congestion or idleness from fine time scale observations and utilizing this information effectively are two key issues. The second method, adaptive forward error correction, is directed at supporting multimedia traffic with real-time constraints without engaging in expensive resource reservations. Retransmission of lost information is not a viable strategy for such traffic classes since lengthy round-trip latencies encountered in wide area network environments render retransmitted information useless to time-constrained applications. We formulate and analyze an adaptive packet-level forward error correction mechanism called AFEC where the degree of redundancy is controlled as a function of network state, increasing the level of redundancy when the network is bad and decreasing it when the network is well-behaved. The control problem is nontrivial due to the fact that increasing the level of redundancy too much can backfire, further aggrevating congestion and causing the probability of timely information recovery at the receiver to decrease. We investigate the conditions under which adaptive forward error correction is effective when traffic is self-similar. We identify two regimes - packet loss dominated connections and delay-dominated connections - the former being most conducive to AFEC-based traffic control whereas the latter is more subtle, admitting only a limited range of useful redundancy. The third method, structural resource allocation, seeks to identify the relative utility of the two principal network resource types - bandwidth and buffer capacity - with respect to their curtailing effects on self-similarity. We conjecture a highly skewed trade-off relationship between bandwidth and buffer capacity in favor of bandwidth whose quantitative form becomes important when computing res ource reservations for traffic streams with stringent quality of service requirements. A bandwidth-over-buffer capacity policy also impacts the first two methods in terms of predictability and packet loss dominatedness\/delay dominatedness. The three methods are expected to complement each other, each focusing on a different mode for quality of service provision under self-similar traffic conditions.","title":"Self-Similar Network Traffic and It's Control","awardID":"9714707","effectiveDate":"1998-03-01","expirationDate":"2002-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"4097","name":"NETWORKING RESEARCH"}}],"PIcoPI":["409715"],"PO":["234222"]}}
