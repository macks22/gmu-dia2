The work investigates and adapts wealth of techniques in traditional parallel computing for graph problems based on a performance model of the cloud and explore strategies for scheduling and load balancing applications on the cloud. These include centralized and distributed approaches for scheduling and work stealing and work sharing. Methodologies to evaluate the framework in executing applications that involve data intensive graph computations are being developed. The broader impact of this project includes addressing key challenges in the areas of application mapping and performance optimization. The research makes developing data intensive graph applications across public and private clouds easier. The developed software will be released as free and open source software to the community, making it possible for researchers and engineers in academia and industry to leverage this work and develop applications for the cloud. Graph problems and streaming applications arising in the area of energy informatics are considered to illustrate the techniques.","title":"CiC (RDDC) Parallelizing Large Scale Graph Problems on the Cloud","awardID":"1048311","effectiveDate":"2011-04-01","expirationDate":"2014-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}}],"PIcoPI":["563658",466860],"PO":["565272"]},"176187":{"abstract":"The Evolution Park provides a testbed for applying evolutionary computation to the development and control of autonomous robotic systems.

The fabricated bodies are coupled with electroactive polymer materials to produce artificial organisms capable of locomotion without motors. Specially instrumented aquatic environments allow robotic fish to be used as stimuli to elicit behavioral responses in living fish under conditions manipulated by the experimenter.

UMAP, the premier user modeling conference in the world, was formed in 2009 as a merger of the long-running and successful biennial conference series on User Modeling (UM, 1986-2007) and the Adaptive Hypermedia and Adaptive Web-Based Systems (AH, 2000-2008); the former provided a forum where academic and industrial researchers from the many fields involved in user modeling research (artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, education, linguistics, psychology, and information science) could exchange their complementary insights on user modeling issues, while the latter provided a forum for dissemination of adaptive technology for hypermedia and other web-based systems. User modeling has been found to significantly enhance the effectiveness and usability of software systems in a variety of areas. A user model is an explicit representation of properties of a particular user; a system that constructs and consults user models can adapt diverse aspects of its performance to individual users. Applications for user modeling range from electronic commerce and intelligent learning environments to health care and assistive technologies. Relevant platforms for user modeling include mobile and wearable systems, and smart environments, as well as individual desktop systems, groupware, adaptive hypermedia, and other web-based systems. More information about the conference is available at http:\/\/www.umap2011.org. <br\/><br\/>The UMAP 2011 Doctoral Consortium will provide a unique opportunity for PhD students partway through their dissertation research to receive valuable feedback from top researchers in the field. The event will be held in a special session that is open to all students, not only those accepted to present, as well as to regular conference attendees, and which is designed so as to provide a great educational opportunity for all attending students, a unique event where a community as a whole can engage in a discussion with students about emerging topics, expected rigor, evaluation approaches, etc. Each student participant will be allotted 15 minutes in which to present his\/her work (including a short demo if appropriate), with an additional 15 minutes allocated to questions and for discussion. Both during the question\/discussion period and in subsequent informal interactions, committee members and other conference participants will provide constructive comments on the student's work and attempt to address any aspects of the work on which s\/he has requested advice. Student papers will be published in the main proceedings of the conference. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Bringing young and creative researchers to UMAP 2011 will help advance an important and socially valuable research field. NSF funding will significantly impact the careers of the next generation of User Modeling researchers, by enabling a number of them to take part in an important event they would otherwise have to miss. The students will have an opportunity to gain wider exposure in the community for their innovative work, and to obtain feedback and guidance from senior members of the research community. Participation will help foster a sense of community among these young researchers, by allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior investigators at a critical stage in their professional development. In allocating NSF funds to participants, the organizers will give preference to students who are placed at a disadvantage due to the conference's location in Europe; they will strive for diversity among the selected students across a number of dimensions (gender, racial, ethnic, disabilities, institutional, etc.), and they will also take special steps to promote participation from institutions with relatively large numbers of students from under-represented groups.","title":"Supporting Students Attending the User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization 2011 Conference","awardID":"1135374","effectiveDate":"2011-04-15","expirationDate":"2012-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["496622"],"PO":["565227"]},"184130":{"abstract":"This award provides funding to support the travel of 13 US-based graduate students to attend the<br\/>23rd ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP 2011) which is held in Cascais, Portugal.","title":"Student Travel Support for the 23rd ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP 2011)","awardID":"1132046","effectiveDate":"2011-04-01","expirationDate":"2012-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["502415","309350"],"PO":["493916"]},"185373":{"abstract":"A hallmark of the scientific method has been that experiments should be described in enough detail that they can be repeated and perhaps generalized. This implies the possibility of repeating results on nominally equal configurations and then generalizing the results by replaying them on new data sets, and seeing how they vary with different parameters. In principle, this should be easier for computational experiments than for natural science experiments, because not only can computational processes be automated but also computational systems do not suffer from the \"biological variation\" that plagues the life sciences. Unfortunately, the state of the art falls far short of this goal. Most computational experiments are specified only informally in papers, where experimental results are briefly described in figure captions; the code that produced the results is seldom available; and configuration parameters change results in unforeseen ways. Because important scientific discoveries are often the result of sequences of smaller, less significant steps, the ability to publish results that are fully documented and reproducible is necessary for advancing science. While concern about repeatability and generalizability cuts across virtually all natural, computational, and social science fields, no single field has identified this concern as a target of a research effort.<br\/><br\/>This collaborative project between the University of Utah and New York University consists of tools and infrastructure that supports the process of sharing, testing and re-using scientific experiments and results by leveraging and extending the infrastructure provided by provenance-enabled scientific workflow systems. The project explores three key research questions: (1) How to package and publish compendia of scientific results that are reproducible and generalizable. (2) What are appropriate algorithms and interfaces for exploring, comparing, re-using the results or potentially discovering better approaches for a given problem? 3) How to aid reviewers to generate experiments that are most informative given a time\/resource limit.<br\/><br\/>An expected result of this work is a software infrastructure that allows authors to create workflows that encode the computational processes that derive the results (including data used, configuration parameters set, and underlying software), publish and connect these to publications where the results are reported. Testers (or reviewers) can repeat and validate results, ask questions anonymously, and modify experimental conditions. Researchers, who want to build upon previous works, are able to search, reproduce, compare and analyze experiments and results. The infrastructure supports scientists, in many disciplines, to derive, publish and share reproducible results. Results of this research, including developed software will be available via the project web site ( http:\/\/www.vistrails.org\/index.php\/RepeatabilityCentral).","title":"III: EAGER: Collaborative Research: A Community Experiment Platform for Reproducibility and Generalizability","awardID":"1139832","effectiveDate":"2011-04-01","expirationDate":"2013-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["521992"],"PO":["563751"]},"174032":{"abstract":"In the life sciences, today?s DNA sequencers can generate a terabyte (or 1 trillion bytes) of data in a minute.

A growing body of empirical and theoretical work points to the features used by traditional NLP systems as the culprit for domain-dependence and for the inability to generalize to previously unseen words. <br\/><br\/>This project is the first to systematically investigate representation-learning as a technique for improving performance on domain adaptation. It explores latent-variable language models ? including Factorial Hidden Markov Models, dependency parsing models, and deep architectures ? as techniques for extracting novel features from text. The resulting representations yield similar features for distributionally-similar words, thereby allowing generalization to words not seen during training of a classifier. The project also explores novel procedures for training a language model, which incorporate Web-scale ngram statistics as substitutes for standard statistics used in unsupervised training.<br\/><br\/>Language users are extraordinarily inventive, and new domains of discourse appear constantly, such as in specialized areas of science and technology. By building on top of the representations produced by this project, NLP systems can improve in accuracy on new domains and on Web text, bringing applications like the Semantic Web closer to reality. For resource-poor languages and domains, the project can help reduce the cost of annotating texts by reducing the need for broad coverage in the training texts.

The goal of such a service is to provide a SQL interface to many applications, storing data that today might be spread across hundreds or thousands of separate database management systems. This is attractive because the costs incurred by individual users in the form of software licensing, hardware, management, and energy can be substantially lowered because it will be possible to multiplex many different databases onto a smaller footprint. Moreover, the costs can be made proportional to actual usage, saving significant up-front investments by application developers. <br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit of CirrusDB relates to three key challenges in this area:<br\/><br\/>1) Multi-tenancy, in which the resource use of a complex set of database workloads are monitored and the databases are consolidated on to a minimum number of physical machines while ensuring performance isolation and live migration with no downtime. Unlike existing work on large-scale multi-tenancy, which has focused on co-locating tenants with similar schemas, CirrusDB attempts to co-locate tenants which have resource utilization profiles that will not exceed the capacity of the machine on which they are hosted.<br\/><br\/>2) Scalability in which the responsibility for query processing (and the corresponding data) is partitioned amongst multiple nodes in the service to achieve high throughput, using a novel graph partitioning strategy.<br\/><br\/>3) In which the DBaaS infrastructure executes SQL queries issued by applications over encrypted data, enabling complete SQL processing over fully private data. The key idea is to use the notion of \"adjustable security\" by encrypting the data in layers in a way that allows not just equality checks but also range queries, sorting operations, and joins to be executed efficiently.<br\/><br\/>CirrusDB will have broad impact in that it will result in database solutions that will a enable large, multi-node database service to be deployed both on a public cloud as well as in private data centers, providing multi-tenancy, scale-out using automatic partitioning, and privacy for SQL query execution. This will result in significantly lower administrative and capital costs required to run large-scale databases. CirrusDB will also reduce the barrier to entry for applications that use databases, because it will not be necessary to have in-house database expertise even when one needs high transactional performance.<br\/><br\/>For further information see the project web site at the URL: http:\/\/db.csail.mit.edu\/cirrusdb\/","title":"III: Medium: Scalable and Secure Database as a Service","awardID":"1065219","effectiveDate":"2011-04-01","expirationDate":"2015-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7364","name":"INFO INTEGRATION & INFORMATICS"}}],"PIcoPI":["525076","562012","508283"],"PO":["563727"]},"174033":{"abstract":"With the development of sequencing technologies, over 1,400 bacterial genomes have been sequenced and this number is rising exponentially.

The project aims to design, implement, and evaluate a practical, concrete system that allows clients to use cloud storage providers like Azure and S3 -- but without the clients having to trust, that is assume, that the providers always operate correctly. <br\/><br\/>Of course, reducing assumptions is generically good, but doing so is particularly relevant to cloud storage: for economic and operational reasons, data is increasingly migrating to storage service providers (SSPs), yet SSPs are complex black boxes that can experience software bugs, correlated manufacturing defects, misconfigured servers, operator error, malicious insiders, bankruptcy, fires, and more. <br\/><br\/>For these reasons, the project is building a system, called Padova, that tolerates scenarios in which all servers in the SSP fail, and the failures include malicious, buggy, or improbably unlucky behaviors. The approach is enforce a sensible ordering of updates at the client; this provides the foundation for safety and allows a client to gather updates from any node in the system, client or server, which in turn contributes to liveness and availability. Padova eliminates trust for safety and minimizes trust for liveness and availability.<br\/><br\/>This project makes cloud storage safer for existing customers and spur further adoption of cloud storage. This means more people paying less for computing, producing beneficial effects throughout the computational ecosystem. The educational benefits include graduate and undergraduate mentoring, the latter through UT's Turing Scholars program, which cultivates particularly talented undergraduates.","title":"CiC: FRCC: Cloud Storage with Minimal Trust","awardID":"1048269","effectiveDate":"2011-04-01","expirationDate":"2014-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"8010","name":"Computing in the Cloud"}}],"PIcoPI":[466839,466840,"470252"],"PO":["565272"]},"177247":{"abstract":"The Internet as an indispensable communication system in our society has its share in energy consumption. The underlying network infrastructure, however, lacks effective energy management solutions. Not only does the energy consumption cost financially and environmentally, it also has becoming a limiting factor in system performance. Today's networks are aggressively over-provisioned in design and load-balanced in operation for maximum performance resulting in routers and links consuming close to peak energy even when highly underutilized. This project exploits routing path redundancy and low link utilization to design smart routing schemes that allow links to sleep when the network traffic load is low, and wake them up to serve the traffic when the load is high, thus reducing energy consumption while preserving network performance. To achieve this, novel algorithms and protocols for power-aware network routing, traffic engineering, and topology in Internet Service Providers will be designed and evaluated. An energy-efficient network infrastructure will lead to a greener Internet and enable ISPs to reduce energy consumptions while still providing QoS at desired levels. In addition, ISPs will be able to deploy network infrastructure in energy-constrained environments, such as post-disaster recovery and under-developed areas. The tools and techniques developed in this project will provide the research community with a platform and direction for research in network energy management.","title":"NeTS: Medium: Green Net: Energy Management for Network Infrastructure","awardID":"1064963","effectiveDate":"2011-04-01","expirationDate":"2015-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":[475179,475180],"PO":["565303"]},"181691":{"abstract":"This proposal seeks funding for partial support of a series of three workshops designed to stimulate the use of new, emerging programming models and advanced high performance computing (HPC) architectures in a variety of computational science disciplines.

(The search and rescue phase has been terminated.) US and Japanese response teams will be deployed for victim and economic recovery decision-making while simultaneously collecting never-before-possible, ephemeral data. The Sendai disaster is unique in its large geographical and economic scale and types of damage. The geographical, damage, and economic scales drive the need for distributed decision-making, where experts will have to consult and work at a distance using remotely acquired data. Sendai also provides the first opportunity to create a corpus from multiple modalities of unmanned systems being used by the same agency. Of the 15 deployments since the first use of rescue robots at the 9-11 World Trade Center collapse, only two, Hurricanes Katrina and Haiti, used both sea and aerial vehicles; notwithstanding, these were controlled by different organizations for tasks by different agencies preventing a longitudinal survey of what works (or does not) for decision-makers and why and how assets should be coordinated.<br\/>Broader Impacts: <br\/>This proposal promises an immediate benefit to society by supporting life saving and economic recovery efforts in Japan through a participatory research paradigm. There are also long term benefits for future disasters since emergency response and unmanned systems are both formative domains and the data collected will advance the discovery and understanding of intelligent, human-centered systems in unpredictable situations.

However, current computational models of semantic learning and representation focus only on linguistic structure. This CAREER award explores how humans use multisensory perception and linguistic experience to organize semantic memory. Dr. Michael Jones at Indiana University will use specially designed web-based experiment protocols to collect large amounts of data about the perceptual structure of word referents. For example, a participant presented with a target word will be required to produce a list of verbal properties to describe the word (e.g., given DOG, a participant might produce \"has four legs, has fur, barks\" etc.). A second participant is then provided with only the list of properties and is required to guess what word is being described. Alternatively, the information to the second participant can be a drawing of what the target word represents to the first participant, who has configured predefined object components into a 2D or 3D display. By designing these experiments as internet based, Dr. Jones will collect very large amounts of data to design and test computer models of linguistic and perceptual integration during word learning. <br\/><br\/>The models resulting from this research may provide a better understanding of the learning disorders characterized by language deficiencies (e.g. many forms of autism) and age-related disorders characterized by semantic disorganization (e.g., dementias such as Alzheimer's Disease). The integration of perceptual and linguistic information could also lead to better applied algorithms for information search (e.g., Internet search engines) if the computer representation can be made to approximate the semantic representation of the human doing the searching.","title":"CAREER: Integrating Perceptual and Linguistic Information in Models of Semantic Representation","awardID":"1056744","effectiveDate":"2011-04-15","expirationDate":"2016-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0404","name":"Division of BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE SCI","abbr":"BCS"},"pgm":{"id":"1311","name":"LINGUISTICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0404","name":"Division of BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE SCI","abbr":"BCS"},"pgm":{"id":"7252","name":"PERCEPTION, ACTION & COGNITION"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["489674"],"PO":["563458"]},"174311":{"abstract":"Throughout the millenia, humans have used graphical symbols. 5000 years ago, in Mesopotamia, a system of symbols was codified into what was to become the world's first writing system. But in addition to writing systems, many symbol systems have been developed that, though they do communicate information, do not encode language. Such non-linguistic symbol systems include familiar examples such as mathematical symbology, European heraldry, or scouting merit badges, as well as less familiar ones such as Mesopotamian deity symbols or Dakota winter counts. Like writing, such systems are an important part of the cultures that created them.<br\/><br\/>Now suppose one has a symbol system whose interpretation is unknown. Short of deciphering it as a writing system, or otherwise providing a rigorous testable interpretation, are there any methods that can determine whether one is dealing with writing or a non-linguistic system? Some recent high-profile papers have indeed claimed to provide statistical evidence that a couple of ancient systems were linguistic. But, one problem with that work is that in order to determine which of two categories an unknown system belongs to, it is very useful to have a large set of examples of the two categories in question. In the case of writing systems, we now have many electronic corpora from hundreds of languages, both ancient and modern. But electronic corpora of non-linguistic systems are few.<br\/><br\/>This project will fill this void by developing and releasing to the public electronic corpora of a range of non-linguistic systems, including those named above as well as several others.

First, the hardware devices are restrictive, cumbersome, and expensive. Second, most techniques only record the kinematic information of the movement, rather than underlying dynamic properties or control mechanisms. Third, the current technique fails to capture the interaction between the subject and the environment. Without the information of contacts, reconstructing motion that consists of complex contact phenomena is nearly impossible. This project develops a new motion acquisition and reconstruction technique that solves all three problems aforementioned. The new technique combines the force sensors and a single video camera to reconstruct full-body poses, joint torques, and contact forces in an unconstrained setting. In contrast to expensive lab equipment, the proposed system consists of a pair of low-cost, non-intrusive force-sensing shoes and a single consumer-level video camera that can be used to acquire motions difficult to capture in the lab. This acquisition technology enables new design of motion controllers by leveraging a large amount of real-world contact data. The research also develops new data representations and novel algorithms for intelligent and efficient motion planning and evaluates the developed motion controllers by simulating a human figure performing challenging balanced activities in a novel and unpredicted environment. <br\/><br\/>The project is tightly integrated with education components in both Georgia Tech and Texas A&M.

Applications will be screened by the consortium chairs for fit to the topic area, state of development and quality of the research project.<br\/><br\/>Broader impacts: The OSS doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of researchers in open source software research, allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. Applications are encouraged from all doctoral students whose research is OSS-related, regardless of the fields in which they are earning their degrees. Participation is encouraged from a broad range of relevant disciplines and approaches, including (but not limited to) computer science, sociology, psychology, anthropology, information science, cognitive science, communication, and economics. While NSF funds will be used chiefly to support participation by students enrolled in graduate programs in the United States, some international participants may be supported as well in recognition of the fact that the OSS field embraces educational and cultural traditions that vary in different parts of the world. The organizers will try explicitly to identify and include the broadest possible group of highly qualified participants. As a consequence of these steps, the student and faculty participants will constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, which will help broaden the students' horizons to the future benefit of the field.","title":"Support for the Open Source Systems 2011 Doctoral Consortium","awardID":"1132151","effectiveDate":"2011-04-01","expirationDate":"2013-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[493835],"PO":["565342"]},"174039":{"abstract":"This research explores an alternative data processing architecture that<br\/>fundamentally improves computing efficiency to reduce costs and provide<br\/>enhanced data mining capabilities for cloud computing.

New software vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited daily, and even if software were bug-free, unaware users may install malware along with free screensavers or greeting cards they download online. Cleaning up after these inevitable compromises leads to days of wasted effort by users or system administrators, with no conclusive guarantee that all traces of the attack are gone, or that no legitimate changes are lost.<br\/><br\/>This research project automates recovery from intrusions by developing a system-wide undo mechanism, so that an administrator can undo an attacker's break-in attempt, along with all of its side-effects, while preserving all other legitimate operations. The key idea is to log all computations, such as processes or system calls, and the dependencies between them, so that if one operation needs to be undone, the system can both undo its direct effects, and recursively track down and re-execute other operations that may have been indirectly affected. Building on this basic approach, the project explores how computer systems must change to securely and efficiently provide system-wide undo, from operating system kernels, to programming languages, to applications and user interfaces.<br\/><br\/>If successful, this project will provide a principled approach to recovering from intrusions in computer systems.

Initial investigation by the PIs, who possess individual expertise in the two fields, has identified similarities in the interface concerns between the two communities (e.g., the number and size of buttons, the use of icons and graphics to communicate, and the need for multiple paths to information collection). The PIs will create and study interfaces that use and expand the interface design guidelines for both communities, bringing together domain experts to launch a new generation of interfaces that are less cognitively demanding and more widely usable by important user populations. To these ends, the team will employ two types of interventions: a prototype driven development effort and an analytic evaluation effort. The prototype driven development effort will seek to address needs of mobile communities and communities of users with cognitive disabilities through user focused interface design. The analytic evaluation effort will draw upon the opinions of experts in the fields of cognitive disabilities, mobile interfaces, cognitive science, human interruption, and health and wellness, to identify the most promising avenues for research and development.

Follow up contacts with past participants show that most of them do, and almost all who have graduated have enrolled in graduate school.<br\/><br\/>The intellectual merit and broader impact of the project are four-fold. First, it consists of the research results produced by the students. Their efforts contributed fresh ideas to ongoing large scale projects, or serve as seed ideas to start up new projects that are continued later by the same or other students. The second intellectual merit is of a pedagogical nature and consists of the lessons learned by the faculty in terms of successful recruiting, mentoring, and retention. Third, the program has a direct impact on the student participants especially when they enroll in graduate studies as a direct result of their participation. Most of the activities related to the program, from recruiting to the many special events open to the public have an indirect impact on a much larger number of students by raising their awareness of the nature of graduate studies and research careers. Finally, the mentors benefit from working with students in a structured setting.","title":"REU Site: Undergraduate Computer Research (UnCoRe)","awardID":"1062960","effectiveDate":"2011-04-01","expirationDate":"2015-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1139","name":"RSCH EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD SITES"}}],"PIcoPI":[474287,"554666"],"PO":["564588"]},"177928":{"abstract":"This proposal seeks support to increase the participation of US researchers to the Conference on the Foundations of Computational Mathematics (FoCM) which will be hosted by the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in Hungary between July 4-14, 2011.

Unique aspects of this REU site are: <br\/><br\/>- Interdisciplinary faculty mentors within one blended department;<br\/>- A successful model based on internal pilot programs held in the summers of 2009 and 2010;<br\/>-The on-site availability of cutting-edge research laboratories, including the NSF-supported MUGrid Project and Nexos Project, which were used during the pilot programs;<br\/>- Inclusion of pre-service math teachers in research opportunities.<br\/><br\/>Throughout science and engineering fields, the availability of cheap computer processing power is driving increased interest in large-scale problems that were previously thought to be intractable through traditional methods. This can include developing new computational methodologies, software and\/or systems, and new theoretical models. Predicting the movement of diseases, understanding the effects of large oil spills, forecasting consumer gas usage, and modeling the catastrophic effects of a volcanic eruption are just a few of the real problems that computers are being used to help solve. At the same time, ever smaller computing platforms have inserted computation into mobile, embedded, and ubiquitous realms of human experience that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. Energy consumption of both massive computing clusters and battery-operated appliances is of great concern, and complex computer systems can now be found at the heart of everything from medical devices to the phones in most Americans' pockets. For both of these kinds of computational systems -- the big and the small -- there is a great need for practitioners with a deep understanding of computer science, modeling and statistical methods who can work across disciplines to build real, robust, and cost-effective solutions. This REU Site will bring 24 undergraduates to Marquette University over the next three years to be mentored by our interdisciplinary faculty of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science in ways to approach the difficult computational problems that face our increasingly technological society.<br\/><br\/>Our mentor research expertise lies in all of these areas, as well as in how people learn in these fields, and how we prepare the next generation of students to explore computational sciences and mathematics. Each of the computational activities concerns students becoming involved in real applications using concepts described in the classroom. They will learn how to apply these abstract concepts to particular areas. Each application has been chosen so that it is accessible to undergraduates, yet is current and useful. Many research projects are smaller versions of potential Ph.D. dissertation topics, and each student works on their own portion of primary research. Our target audience is undergraduates of all levels majoring in mathematics, statistics, computer science, or related areas. The project includes a recruiting plan targeting a population of students with little or no access to research opportunities both within and outside of the immediate Milwaukee area. Underrepresented student populations will be targeted and encouraged to apply. Our mentor pool is highly diverse in both the academic and demographic senses, and we look forward to attracting some of the most talented students in the region and the nation for a summer of computational sciences.","title":"REU Site: Computation Across the Disciplines","awardID":"1063041","effectiveDate":"2011-04-01","expirationDate":"2014-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"03","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR MATHEMATICAL & PHYSICAL SCIEN","abbr":"MPS"},"div":{"id":"0304","name":"Division of MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES","abbr":"DMS"},"pgm":{"id":"7335","name":"WORKFORCE IN THE MATHEMAT SCI"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"1139","name":"RSCH EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD SITES"}}],"PIcoPI":["558335",474365],"PO":["564588"]},"180747":{"abstract":"This project will support students to attend the International conference on distributed systems (ICDCS) to be held in Minneapolis, MN in June 2011.

First, the hardware devices are restrictive, cumbersome, and expensive. Second, most techniques only record the kinematic information of the movement, rather than underlying dynamic properties or control mechanisms. Third, the current technique fails to capture the interaction between the subject and the environment. Without the information of contacts, reconstructing motion that consists of complex contact phenomena is nearly impossible. This project develops a new motion acquisition and reconstruction technique that solves all three problems aforementioned. The new technique combines the force sensors and a single video camera to reconstruct full-body poses, joint torques, and contact forces in an unconstrained setting. In contrast to expensive lab equipment, the proposed system consists of a pair of low-cost, non-intrusive force-sensing shoes and a single consumer-level video camera that can be used to acquire motions difficult to capture in the lab. This acquisition technology enables new design of motion controllers by leveraging a large amount of real-world contact data. The research also develops new data representations and novel algorithms for intelligent and efficient motion planning and evaluates the developed motion controllers by simulating a human figure performing challenging balanced activities in a novel and unpredicted environment. <br\/><br\/>The project is tightly integrated with education components in both Georgia Tech and Texas A&M.

Current state-of-the-art methods for recognizing large vocabularies of gestures have significant limitations that impact both system design and the user experience. Many methods assume the existence of a near-perfect hand detector\/tracker; that is a limiting assumption, which prevents deployment of these methods in complex real-world settings where such accuracy is unachievable. In the absence of perfect hand detectors, system design may involve a large investment in manual annotation of training videos (e.g., specifying hand locations), so as to provide sufficiently clean information to training modules. The user experience is affected by the limited accuracy and robustness of existing applications. In this research the PI will address these issues by explicitly designing recognition and indexing methods that require neither perfect hand detectors nor extensive manual annotations, thus making it substantially easier to deploy accurate and efficient gesture recognition systems in real-world settings. The PI will achieve these objectives through theoretical advances in the current state of the art in computer vision, pattern recognition, and database indexing. The unifying theme in the project is the integration of low-level tracking modules that produce imperfect output, with recognition and indexing methods that are designed to take as input this imperfect output from the tracking modules. Novel articulated tracking methods will be developed that utilize probabilistic graph models to provide fully automatic long-term tracking, while improving upon the excessive time complexity that probabilistic graph models currently incur. New methods will be designed for extracting and exploiting information from hand appearance. As these novel modeling and recognition methods will violate standard assumptions made by existing indexing methods, new indexing methods will be formulated which will improve the efficiency of search in large databases of dynamic gestures and static hand shapes within the proposed framework.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: Project outcomes will significantly improve the ability of sign language users around the world to search databases of sign language videos and to perform tasks such as looking up the meaning of an unknown sign or retrieving occurrences of a sign of interest in videos of continuous signing. These search tools will have an impact in educational settings, facilitating both learning a sign language and accessing arbitrary information available in a sign language. To these ends, the PI will make his software freely available to the public online. He will also work with experts in American Sign Language to implement key applications using his tools, which will be made available to Deaf students.

Tools that open up new creative areas for mass experimentation and collaboration are tremendously important both for the future of computing and the future of society at large. Equally important are tools that bridge the digital and physical worlds, and tools and activities that diversify computing. This project is situated at a powerful intersection. The PI will design and test toolkits and curricula that blend computing with paper and fabric, and thus enable diverse groups of people to build hybrid digital-physical systems. And she will conduct longitudinal studies of the real-world creative communities that develop around these tools. This work will contribute to the study of creativity support tools, ubiquitous computing, educational technology, and creative communities.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The PI expects project outcomes to broaden participation in computing, by providing new communities (including groups of women, economically disadvantaged urban youth, and senior citizens) with compelling incentives to engage in computer science and other STEM disciplines. The tools developed in this work will expand the culture of computing by providing examples of technology that looks and feels very different from the technology we're accustomed to. The PI will make her tools available both to educators and the general public in order to ensure that the research has long-term, real-world impact.","title":"CAREER: Material Computing for Everyone: Democratizing Creative Computing via Unexpected Materials and Cultures","awardID":"1053235","effectiveDate":"2011-04-01","expirationDate":"2016-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[469513],"PO":["565227"]},"176164":{"abstract":"Today's electric power grid is experiencing a significant transformation because of rapid developments in renewable energy and smart grid technologies. This transition inevitably demands significant transformative research on many rapidly arising issues while the operation, stability, and reliability of the existing power grid is not affected. <br\/>This project supports the acquisition of a modern real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation system to advance smart grid and renewable energy technologies. The project will model smart grid components in a multi-disciplinary manner and investigate the interoperability characteristics of renewable energy sources, energy storage systems, and \"smart\" loads within a smart microgrid framework. The project will result in advanced computational technologies efficient for simulation-based study of both long- and short-term dynamics of future ?mixed system? and ?mixed signal? power grid configurations. At the same time, the project will examine how to integrate energy and intelligent-agent-based computing and communication systems within a decentralized electric power grid.<br\/>The project will enhance the development of advanced technologies for the future smart power grid, reduce energy-related emissions, improve energy efficiency of all economic sectors, and strengthen the technological lead for the United States in the advanced computing and energy fields. The project will attract and retain more minority and female students to the computational energy system program and educate young engineers and scientists to meet the rapid developments in energy and cyber technology for the 21st century.","title":"II-New: Modern Computing Infrastructure for Research and Education of Future Smart and Renewable Energy Systems","awardID":"1059265","effectiveDate":"2011-04-01","expirationDate":"2014-03-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7359","name":"COMPUTING RES INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":[472085,"548563",472087,"524705",472089],"PO":["563661"]}}
