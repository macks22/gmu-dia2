{"159324":{"abstract":"Citizen Schools proposes to engage 5,700 disadvantaged middle school students in hands-on computing and related STEM projects across its 7-state network of after-school and extended learning programs. By working side-by-side with professionals and graduate students from information technology and other scientific fields, middle school students will realize a connection between their after-school computing apprenticeships and the college and career opportunities to which they can aspire. In the 11-week apprenticeship courses offered within existing Citizen Schools after-school programs, middle school students will create authentic projects that develop a combination of hard and soft skills. Students will build relationships with the adult volunteers who will lead their apprenticeship courses, and these volunteers will speak credibly to students, sharing with them career opportunities in the computing and STEM fields and discussing the academic preparation necessary to pursue them. As a result, disadvantaged middle school students will be more likely to enroll in challenging courses when they enter high school, to better prepare for college, and ultimately to pursue careers in computing and other scientific fields. The project will include four types of apprenticeships: Programming in Computer Game Design, Programming in Robotics, Web Design and Web Related Projects, and Apprenticeships in Astronomy, Solar Energy, Biotechnology, Engineering, and other STEM fields. The project will be evaluated based on pre-post assessments of students? interest in pursuing computing and STEM careers, their understanding of the educational requirements for entry and advancement in those fields, and their sense of efficacy in their ability to attain college admission and career opportunity.","title":"BCP-LSA: After-School Apprenticeships","awardID":"0940604","effectiveDate":"2010-02-01","expirationDate":"2013-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7482","name":"BROADENING PARTIC IN COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[425930,425931,425932],"PO":["560704"]},"166872":{"abstract":"This workshop is made possible due to the generous support of the Information and Intelligent Systems Directorate and the Office of International Science and Engineering of the National Science Foundation.<br\/><br\/>Research in Computational Linguistics (CL) and related fields is carried out in all of the Americas.

These variations include developmental stages, disease, and evolution. Molecular sequence and expression datasets have been used effectively to identify frequently mutated genes and the relative abundance\/lack of their products in cells carrying the phenotype of interest. While the role of contextual information, manifested in networks of biomolecular interactions is widely acknowledged, lack of high-quality data has impeded the development and use of network-based analyses. Recent high-throughput methods for network inference hold tremendous potential for network-based phenotype analysis. However, existing computational methods are in relative infancy. The primary objective of this project is the development of computational models and algorithms that enable integration of disparate datasets (gene sequences, gene expression, protein expression, protein interactions) for phenotypic characterization.<br\/><br\/>Network-based modeling of phenotypic differences gives rise to deep intellectual questions relating to computational abstraction, algorithm design, and biological validation. These challenges are exacerbated by the incomplete, static, and noisy nature of available network data. The proposed research aims to overcome these difficulties through innovative use of combinatorial, probabilistic, and algebraic methods, including the following: (i) combinatorial modeling of coordinate changes in the expression of multiple interacting genes, (ii) probabilistic modeling of the crosstalk in biomolecular networks, for statistically sound evaluation of functional association between multiple genes and proteins, and (iii) algebraic modeling of information flow in the cell, to make indirect inferences on the effects of multiple genetic perturbations. The resulting computational tools will be integrated into frequently accessed application frameworks, including Cytoscape, R, and Matlab, used extensively by domain scientists at Case Center for Proteomics and Bioinformatics, for testing, validation, and calibration, and subsequently disseminated to the broader scientific community.<br\/><br\/>The proposed career plan also incorporates major educational and outreach initiatives that build on the interdisciplinary nature of proposed research. These initiatives include (i) novel instructional techniques based on active learning, (ii) continued development of a Computer Science education platform, TELESCOPE, for the purpose of illustrating basic algorithmic and problem solving principles, (iii) incorporation of TELESCOPE into outreach efforts, targeting K-12 schools, CWRUs TRIO programs for low income pre-college students, and CWRUs Equinox summer program, (iv) programs for student involvement (particularly minority and female) in outreach efforts, (v) development of new interdisciplinary courses and degree programs at undergraduate and graduate levels, and (vi) continued involvement of undergraduate students in research projects.","title":"CAREER: Computational Models and Algorithms for Differential Network Analysis in Systems Biology","awardID":"0953195","effectiveDate":"2010-02-01","expirationDate":"2015-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7796","name":"ALGORITHMIC FOUNDATIONS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7931","name":"COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY"}}],"PIcoPI":[432373],"PO":["565223"]},"165389":{"abstract":"Increasingly, the engineering of complex systems requires consideration of an intricate web of components and their interaction in diverse social and technical environments.

Scientific applications, on consolidated resources ranging from private clouds within universities and research organizations, science clouds consisting of various grid resources such as supercomputing centers etc, and commercial clouds such as Amazon, GoGrid, Rackspace, etc, represent a highly distributed application context that shall hugely benefit from considerable diversification of the underlying network substrate.<br\/><br\/>The next generation Internet should allow multiple packet switching network contexts to co-exist over a shared substrate. Each context is allowed to independently optimize its specific context without adversely affecting the performance of other co-located network contexts. To that end, the principal investigators (PIs) present ?elastic pipes,? a dynamic, on-demand, end-to-end, infrastructure-provisioning layer for the Internet. Elastic pipes borrow themselves from elastic clouds, an on demand, dynamic, compute resource leasing architecture popularized by various cloud computing platforms. However, the primary motivation behind the elastic pipe concept is to add architectural support for the realization of multiple isolated ?requirement specific? networking contexts to co-exist over the multi-domain shared infrastructure of the current Internet. ?Isolation? as it applies to the proposed design is different from that in ?virtualization? mechanisms based on two fundamental design constraints that the PIs have imposed:<br\/><br\/>C1. The fundamental packet processing discipline in the native infrastructure has to be preserved.<br\/>C2. Independent routing domains (commonly known as Autonomous Systems (AS) need to be allowed to control and optimize their individual networks.<br\/><br\/>This project is a proof-of-concept implementation of a new object oriented Internet architecture. This implementation is expected to result in a thorough feasibility study of the basic principles behind the PIs? architectural ideas for the next generation Internet. Additionally, the elastic pipe abstraction is in itself an independent module that can be incrementally implemented over the present Internet to provide huge gains in terms of diversification of the presently ?ossified? Internet.<br\/><br\/>The PIs use the specific use-case context of large scale scientific experimentation to demonstrate the claims of our architecture. Large scale distributed scientific experiments consist of geographically spread out scientists, scientific installations using dedicated networking resources. Such specialized facilities incur huge setup costs and time that need to be amortized through sufficient long term usage. Large scale scientific experiments thus serve as the perfect use case for multiple ?requirement specific networking contexts.?<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact<br\/><br\/>The proposed research may serve as a basis of a next generation Internet architecture that will allow natural sharing of resources among multiple organizations by dynamically configuring and creating a requirement specific network context for a particular application. Work under this award will develop the primitives of the ?elastic pipes? abstraction that has the potential to change the basic paradigm of all distributed computing. Also, the basic constraints placed on the design allow an incremental deployment of the PIs? ideas to the present Internet. The PIs plan to organize special sessions at leading business and networking conferences, such as Globecom, Infocom, and SIGCOMM and the results of this project will be integrated in graduate courses on networking architecture at the two universities.","title":"Collaborative Research:EAGER:Large-Scale Distributed Scientific Experiments on Shared Substrate","awardID":"1019119","effectiveDate":"2010-02-15","expirationDate":"2012-10-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7794","name":"NETWORK SCIENCE & ENGINEERING"}}],"PIcoPI":["532762"],"PO":["564993"]},"165765":{"abstract":"Computing is moving beyond the desktop into new physical and social contexts.

Designing such systems requires interdisciplinary thinking, and making them encompasses not only technical knowledge of software, electronics, and mechanics, but also the use implications of a system's physical form and behavior as well as its impacts on society.<br\/><br\/>This is funding to support a research consortium (workshop) of approximately a dozen promising doctoral students from the United States and abroad, along with distinguished research faculty. The event will take place in conjunction with the ACM SIGCHI TEI-10 conference, which will be held January 25-27, 2010, at the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, MA. Launched in 2007 and now in its fourth year, the TEI conference series brings together researchers, designers, engineers, and artists who are working in the emerging field of tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction. It provides a meeting ground for the diverse communities of research and practice involved with tangibles, spanning topics ranging from computing, hardware, and sensor technology, to HCI, interaction design, and CSCW, to product and industrial design and interactive arts. The intimate size of this single-track conference (about 150 participants annually) provides a unique forum for exchanging ideas through talks, interactive exhibits, demos, posters, art installations and performances. The Web site for the conference is http:\/\/www.tei-conf.org\/10.<br\/><br\/>The TEI-10 Graduate Student Symposium, which will immediately precede the main conference on Sunday, January 24, will invite twelve graduate students from TEI fields to participate in a critical discussion and review of their work with four faculty mentors. Students will present their work in posters at the conference and their short papers will be included in the conference Proceedings. In addition, students enrolled in the Graduate Student Consortium will have the opportunity to review their research with their peers and with four faculty mentors experienced in the field who will constructively critique the students' work from diverse viewpoints. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This workshop will sharpen the research skills of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and designers who will shape human-centered computing as it takes place in physical things and places. Already we are observing the impact of this field in our daily lives, as computing becomes embedded in our phones, our bus stops, and soon even our clothing. Now is a critical moment in the field, as a wave of early exploratory prototypes begins to give way to disciplined investigations, the development of toolkits, and more rigorous evaluation methods. Mentoring a next generation of TEI researchers is crucial if the field is to retain its initial vigor and openness as it gains foothold in the academic establishment of human-computing research. The Graduate Student Consortium will broaden participation in the TEI 2010 conference by enabling 12 young scholars to attend. The TEI organizing committee will make special efforts to recruit a diverse set of student participants, particularly seeking members of groups that are under-represented in computer and information science and engineering, including women and members of U.S. minority populations. The committee is particularly concerned with increasing participation of underrepresented groups and will also ensure that the meeting is accessible to participants with disabilities.","title":"Workshop: Graduate Student Consortium at Tangible Embedded Interaction 2010","awardID":"1003935","effectiveDate":"2010-02-01","expirationDate":"2011-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["538656"],"PO":["565227"]},"159319":{"abstract":"The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) propose to broaden participation in computing by leveraging the Broadening Engagement program of the SC (\"Supercomputing\") conferences for 2010-2012.

Scientific applications, on consolidated resources ranging from private clouds within universities and research organizations, science clouds consisting of various grid resources such as supercomputing centers etc, and commercial clouds such as Amazon, GoGrid, Rackspace, etc, represent a highly distributed application context that shall hugely benefit from considerable diversification of the underlying network substrate.<br\/><br\/>The next generation Internet should allow multiple packet switching network contexts to co-exist over a shared substrate. Each context is allowed to independently optimize its specific context without adversely affecting the performance of other co-located network contexts. To that end, the principal investigators (PIs) present ?elastic pipes,? a dynamic, on-demand, end-to-end, infrastructure-provisioning layer for the Internet. Elastic pipes borrow themselves from elastic clouds, an on demand, dynamic, compute resource leasing architecture popularized by various cloud computing platforms. However, the primary motivation behind the elastic pipe concept is to add architectural support for the realization of multiple isolated ?requirement specific? networking contexts to co-exist over the multi-domain shared infrastructure of the current Internet. ?Isolation? as it applies to the proposed design is different from that in ?virtualization? mechanisms based on two fundamental design constraints that the PIs have imposed:<br\/><br\/>C1. The fundamental packet processing discipline in the native infrastructure has to be preserved.<br\/>C2. Independent routing domains (commonly known as Autonomous Systems (AS) need to be allowed to control and optimize their individual networks.<br\/><br\/>This project is a proof-of-concept implementation of a new object oriented Internet architecture. This implementation is expected to result in a thorough feasibility study of the basic principles behind the PIs? architectural ideas for the next generation Internet. Additionally, the elastic pipe abstraction is in itself an independent module that can be incrementally implemented over the present Internet to provide huge gains in terms of diversification of the presently ?ossified? Internet.<br\/><br\/>The PIs use the specific use-case context of large scale scientific experimentation to demonstrate the claims of our architecture. Large scale distributed scientific experiments consist of geographically spread out scientists, scientific installations using dedicated networking resources. Such specialized facilities incur huge setup costs and time that need to be amortized through sufficient long term usage. Large scale scientific experiments thus serve as the perfect use case for multiple ?requirement specific networking contexts.?<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact<br\/><br\/>The proposed research may serve as a basis of a next generation Internet architecture that will allow natural sharing of resources among multiple organizations by dynamically configuring and creating a requirement specific network context for a particular application. Work under this award will develop the primitives of the ?elastic pipes? abstraction that has the potential to change the basic paradigm of all distributed computing. Also, the basic constraints placed on the design allow an incremental deployment of the PIs? ideas to the present Internet. The PIs plan to organize special sessions at leading business and networking conferences, such as Globecom, Infocom, and SIGCOMM and the results of this project will be integrated in graduate courses on networking architecture at the two universities.","title":"Collaborative Research:EAGER:Large-Scale Distributed Scientific Experiments on Shared Substrate","awardID":"1019120","effectiveDate":"2010-02-15","expirationDate":"2014-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7794","name":"NETWORK SCIENCE & ENGINEERING"}}],"PIcoPI":["532760"],"PO":["564993"]},"170342":{"abstract":"CIF: Small: Collaborative Research: Wireless Networks: Fundamental Limits via Extremal Entropy Properties<br\/><br\/>Using extremal entropy properties to characterize the fundamental performance limits of network communication is a tradition of information theory.

Moreover, wireless features such as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, channel uncertainty incurred by fading, and secrecy constraints due to the broadcast nature of radio communication bring new challenges that cannot be overcome by the entropy-power inequality of Shannon and Stam alone.

The first ITS conference was held in 1988 in Montreal, and they have continued every two years for the past 12 years in locations that include Brazil, Taiwan, France, and Canada as well as the United States. The ITS conferences offer a rare professional opportunity for interdisciplinary researchers from around the world to converge and present cutting-edge results from the fields of artificial intelligence, computer science, cognitive and learning sciences, psychology, and educational technology. The goal is to promote studies in advanced systems in computer science applied to education, cognitive science and human learning for learners of all ages. To that end, the series provides a forum for the interchange of ideas in all areas of computer science and human learning, a unique environment in which researchers and practitioners exchange ideas, theories, experiments, techniques, applications and evaluations of initiatives supporting new developments relevant for the future. Comments and feedback from each previous ITS conference indicate that the carefully structured conference format continues to be professionally rewarding and stimulating to all who attend. ITS conferences are highly refereed international events and serve as reference guidelines for the research community; each paper is generally reviewed by 4 referees so that having a paper published at ITS is a reference of quality for any researcher evaluation. The conferences operate under the auspices of an independent nonprofit organization and are funded entirely by registration fees. More information about the conference is available at http:\/\/www.cmu.edu\/its2010.<br\/><br\/>Students supported by NSF funds will have the opportunity to attend sessions with papers, posters, tutorials, workshops, and informal interactions with accomplished researchers, the latter within the framework of a Young Researchers Track that includes special sessions for the students to present their research ideas, meet peers who have related interests, and receive feedback and mentoring from senior members of the ITS community. A structured program will be provided in which each student is matched with a mentor who will be encouraged to offer feedback and support to students as they prepare their presentations, during the doctoral consortium sessions, and in at least one 1-on-1 meeting. The doctoral consortium will be situated within the main conference program in order to encourage maximal community involvement. Its structure will facilitate as much discussion and feedback as possible. With this goal in mind, students will present their work at lunchtime poster sessions open to all attendees. To avoid competition with other events and to maximize attendance, no other talks will be scheduled at this time and posters will be in the same rooms as the buffet lunch for all conference attendees. To acquaint attendees with student work, student poster sessions will be immediately preceded by \"fire-hose\" sessions where students summarize their work very briefly. To enable poster presenters to see and discuss each other's posters, poster presentations will span all 3 days of the main conference so as to give students one day to present their posters and two days to see others. Space and logistics permitting, presenters will be able to leave their posters up all 3 days of the conference, affording additional opportunities to discuss them with other researchers, for example during coffee breaks. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This activity supports one of NSF's core missions, to train more advanced professionals in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Participating in the conference will provide the selected students with a unique opportunity to be exposed to current research directions in different research communities both domestic and foreign. This is important for the field, because it has been recognized that transformative advances in research tend to derive from the melding of cross-disciplinary knowledge and multinational perspectives. Participants will be encouraged to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development, to form collaborative relationships, and to generate new research questions to be addressed during the coming years.

In recent years, botnets have distinguished themselves from previous generation malware as the primary platform and root-cause for most Internet attacks and illegal activities. With the magnitude and the potency of attacks afforded by their combined bandwidth and processing power, botnets are now considered as the greatest single threat to Internet security.

To achieve its goal, a prediction market offers a contract whose future payoff is tied to outcomes of an event of interest. Participants of the market express their information about the event through trading the contract. The market price hence potentially incorporates the information of all participants and approximately represents a consensus forecast for the event. Prediction markets have shown great potential as highly effective information aggregation tools in practice. However, they may be subject to manipulation. Participants have incentives to lie about their information in order to seize more profit in the market or be rewarded outside the market. With manipulation, information aggregation may fail and the credibility of market prices is put into question. Another challenge is the computational problem of operating combinatorial prediction markets. When the mechanism becomes more expressive and participants can reveal their information on combinations of outcomes, the process of operating a market may become computationally intractable, which makes such combinatorial prediction markets impractical to use. The goal of this project is to perform a foundational study on issues that arise in prediction market design<br\/>because of the self-interest of participants and the need of expressiveness. Using computer science theory and game theory as the main research approaches, Dr. Chen will establish the strategic and computational foundations for prediction markets so as to design market mechanisms that are not only theoretically sound but also practically applicable for information aggregation in complex real-world settings.<br\/><br\/>This project is centered around two themes: manipulation-resistant prediction markets and computationally efficient combinatorial prediction markets. The research on manipulation-resistant prediction markets investigates when manipulation arises, how manipulation affects information aggregation, and how to design prediction market mechanisms to explicitly control the impact of manipulation. It will provide answers to the most fundamental question of whether people can trust the<br\/>information conveyed by prediction markets and design robust market mechanisms for information aggregation. The research on computationally efficient combinatorial prediction markets examines the tradeoff between expressiveness and computational complexity of combinatorial prediction markets, designs tractable combinatorial prediction markets, and develops efficient approximation algorithms for intractable combinatorial prediction markets. It will help to transfer combinatorial prediction markets from theoretical artifacts to practical devices for aggregating richer information. This project does not depend on any specific application domain. Hence, mechanisms designed in this project can be applied to aggregate information in many settings, including business, government, and society. Results of this project will also help to inform policy making on the possible regulation of prediction markets.","title":"CAREER: Foundataions of Markets as Information Aggregation Mechanisms","awardID":"0953516","effectiveDate":"2010-02-01","expirationDate":"2015-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7796","name":"ALGORITHMIC FOUNDATIONS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7932","name":"COMPUT GAME THEORY & ECON"}}],"PIcoPI":["541778"],"PO":["565251"]},"161863":{"abstract":"Security risks associated with software that communicates over networks have become an increasingly costly problem for consumers, firms, and governments. A key characteristic of any interconnected system (e.g., network software such as Apache HTTP server, the smart grid, and airline baggage operations) is that choices made in the design, deployment, and usage of these systems can have significant implications for security risk. Because these choices are often driven by economic tradeoffs, both firm and consumer incentives can be designed to encourage the development of systems that are less vulnerable. Further, due to the fact that seemingly disparate systems are connected through the network, security weaknesses in one system can rapidly cause major problems for another. Because of these negative externalities, governments may need to intervene through regulation or legislation to ensure the security of critical components of the public infrastructure (e.g., the Internet). This project develops a research framework to analyze the relationship between government policy, economic incentives of firms and consumers, and software security risks of networks. The goal of the project is to gain new insights into how the efforts of firms, consumers, and government can be coordinated to improve software security. To better understand this socio-technical problem, the research will generate formal economic theory to analyze the complex interactions between these entities, each of whom has varying economic incentives. Three important aspects of the software security landscape are studied: software liability, the impact of software deployment models, and open source software incentives for security. To clarify the interplay between public and private forces on security, this research program rigorously studies the role of government in setting policy on software liability, security investment, and technology-specific subsidization to help control software security risks. It will provide guidelines on how software liability should be employed in a context with security interdependence. Also, since design choices by software firms partially determine a given product?s risk exposure to both directed and undirected security attacks, a modeling framework is built to examine how each type of attack distinctly influences software security in consideration of user behavior; the results have important implications for optimal software design. An important outcome of the work is to combine for the first time research on the economics of open source software with that on security risk, two significant streams of research in the literature. In this dimension, the project investigates whether open source software can lower security risks and lead to socially preferable outcomes.<br\/><br\/>By advancing one?s understanding of how to manage software security risk, this project will have wideranging impacts. First, the results will provide guidance to policy makers on how to craft policies which account for firm and user behavior while mitigating the enormous social and economic losses from security attacks on software. Since software security is critical to national defense, one priority is to keep an open dialogue with appropriate government agencies on the project?s outcomes. Second, this work can advise software firms on improved software design and using source code strategy to achieve greater security.

The \"Medicine Meets Virtual Reality\" (MMVR) conference series, established in 1992, has evolved into an annual international event that promotes emerging data-centered technologies for medical care and education. The conference is independent of any professional association or institution; papers are selected on the basis of peer review by a committee of scientists and physicians (http:\/\/www.nextmed.com\/mmvr_committee.html), and the conference proceedings are published by IOS Press (http:\/\/www.iospress.nl). Conference attendees are typically a mixture of computer scientists and engineers, physicians and surgeons, medical educators and students, military medicine specialists, and biomedical futurists. This makes for an audience that is interested in cutting edge science and promotes cross-cutting interdisciplinary studies in the area of clinical simulation. <br\/><br\/>This is funding to support a research consortium (workshop) of approximately 12-15 promising doctoral students from the United States and abroad, along with distinguished research faculty. The event, the first of its kind to be associated with MMVR, will be held in conjunction with the MMVR18 conference which will take place January 14-16, 2010, in Newport Beach, California. The goal of the workshop is to guide students with their research theses, by providing specific feedback as well as broader advice on the research environment and its international dimensions. The workshop will take place on a single full day before the main conference begins. Students will present and discuss their research and get constructive feedback from a panel of about 6 leaders in the field, whose members include approximately equal numbers of prominent research faculty and experienced practitioners, and who represent multiple specialties and countries. At least one panelist will have a close relationship with industry, so students can acquire a better understanding of the commercial perspective. As an experimental activity, the workshop organizers plan to support the students and their academic pursuits beyond the conference, by developing a dedicated website along with a listserv that will link workshop participants together so they can continue to interact by sharing materials and interesting literature, discussing common concerns, etc. Thus, the workshop will promote development of a network of young researchers, which the organizers hope will serve as the basis for future collaborations.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This workshop will have both technical and societal impact. From a technical perspective, it will serve to train and guide the next generation of researchers, who will address the myriad research questions facing the clinical simulation community. Computing and technology research has a major role to play in the need for a more efficient healthcare system. Clinical simulation has emerged as a major tool for the healthcare industry in training the next generation of medical professionals, enabling healthcare institutes to make complex decisions and provide state of the art clinical and ambulatory services. Training doctoral students in computer science and related areas to conduct the necessary basic research in clinical simulation is critical to the successful translation of this basic research to tools and techniques used in the healthcare arena. The workshop will have impact in the short term by providing young researchers with an avenue to interact with leaders in the field and hone their skills; panelists will provide timely feedback to students and help them shape their future research directions. From a societal perspective, the workshop will further the goals of designing human centered systems that enable patient safety, by laying the foundation for research that is grounded and intricately designed from its inception to address key research challenges facing the biomedical computing community.","title":"Workshop: Doctoral Consortium at the Medicine Meets Virtual Reality (MMVR) 2010 Conference","awardID":"0946781","effectiveDate":"2010-02-01","expirationDate":"2011-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["438517"],"PO":["565227"]},"161848":{"abstract":"The next generation networks are envisaged to be very large-scale, highly complex systems that handle heterogeneous traffic in diverse environments, are truly distributed and have even greater capacity, reliability and capability.

The outlined research is based on the vision that considering a patient?s individual genetic make-up will help in selecting drugs that yields the best personalized prognosis. New generation of cancer drugs designed to interfere with specific molecular targets have been developed in the last decade. The success of these targeted drugs have been limited since the selection of the drugs and the time and sequence of drug administration are based on empirical principles without mathematical models to design and estimate the efficiency of intervention strategies. The goal of this proposal is to provide a theoretical and computational framework to estimate the uncertainties in genetic regulatory network modeling and generate robust therapeutic strategies for genetic diseases such as cancer. <br\/><br\/>One of the objectives of genetic regulatory network modeling is to design and analyze therapeutic intervention strategies aimed at moving the network out of undesirable states, such as those associated with disease, and into desirable ones. However, limited experimental data prevent accurate inference of the mathematical model of the genetic regulatory network. For the success of a mathematically designed intervention strategy for genetic diseases, it is critical to (a) study the effect of modeling errors on the predictive power of the inferred network model and on the intervention outcome and (b) design control strategies that posses some degree of robustness to the modeling uncertainties. The project is timely and appropriate as increasing the effectiveness of cancer therapies in the clinical setting will require intervention strategies that possess some degree of robustness to the uncertainties in the modeling process. The proposed research is expected to provide bounds on the performance of mathematically designed intervention strategies. Algorithms to design robust control strategies with the objectives of avoiding extremely undesirable results (minimax design) or improving the expected chances of success (Bayesian approach) will be developed. The developed strategies will be applied to the problem of intervention in human cancer cell lines and targeted therapy in mice models, in collaboration with the PI?s medical collaborators at Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) and University of Texas Health Sciences Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA).<br\/><br\/>The interdisciplinary nature of this proposal promises to foster cross-fertilization of ideas between electrical engineering and systems biology through research and education. Some of the salient features of the education and outreach plan are to (i) develop an interdisciplinary graduate course on Genetic Regulatory Network Modeling and Control and an undergraduate course on Engineering Applications in Biology, (ii) establish a research laboratory at Texas Tech University to prepare students with skills in Genomic Signal Processing (GSP) research, (iii) involve undergraduates in GSP research through Project Laboratory Courses and the TTU Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate Science Education Program, (iv) increase awareness of GSP among K-12 students through the Clark Scholars program and presentations at events involving high school students, and (v) further interactions with the Medical Research Community. The research results will be disseminated to the broad audience via peer reviewed publications, conference presentations and seminars.","title":"CAREER: Robustness in Genetic Regulatory Network Modeling and Control","awardID":"0953366","effectiveDate":"2010-02-01","expirationDate":"2015-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7796","name":"ALGORITHMIC FOUNDATIONS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7931","name":"COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7936","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING"}}],"PIcoPI":["559863"],"PO":["565223"]},"161819":{"abstract":"As Computer Science struggles to understand the Internet and its capabilities, computer scientists are incorporating concepts and methodologies from Economics and Game Theory into their discipline. In the past decade, there has been a tremendous growth in research, centering around the following questions: what game-theoretic tools are applicable to computer systems? How far is the performance of a system from optimality due to the conflict of interests of its users and administrators? And, how can we design a system whose performance is robust with respect to the potential conflict of interests inside the system? The proposed research aims to tackle some of the fundamental problems at the interface of Computer Science and Game Theory, with a focus on networked interactions.<br\/><br\/>The tools that game theorists have traditionally used to model behavior in systems of interacting individuals, such as the Nash and the market equilibria, have been recently shown to be computationally intractable. The intractability of these concepts limits their applicability to policy making since their predictions, although mathematically well-defined, are hard to compute. Moreover, this intractability result raises suspicion as to whether these predictions arise in actuality: if the behavior predicted by some equilibrium concept cannot be found efficiently, how is it that rational individuals find it and adopt it?<br\/><br\/>The goal of this project is to develop a theory of networked interactions that does not run into the computational complexity barrier, answering such questions as: In what settings is it possible to use existing tools, such as the Nash equilibrium, to predict selfish behavior computationally efficiently? How does the structure of the interaction graph affect the tractability of equilibria? When computing Nash equilibria is intractable, is it possible to make approximate predictions efficiently? And if this is infeasible, are there other concepts of equilibrium that are both plausible and tractable? Also, in the context of trading: What kind of market equilibrium comes about in a trading network? Is it always identical to the market equilibrium assuming full information? If so, how does it come to arise in the presence of the communication constraints imposed by the network structure? If not, how different is it? And for what kinds of networks is it similar to the full-information one?<br\/><br\/>The development of a successful theory of networked interactions will necessitate answering deep questions within the theory of computation. Equilibrium concepts typically correspond to fixed points of continuous maps, which have proven to be a challenging computational object for present techniques. In recent years, algorithmic progress on computing equilibria has brought new techniques to the theoretical computer science community. Likewise, characterizing the complexity of game-theoretic concepts has broadened the computational complexity landscape beyond traditional complexity classes. Several questions, such as the approximation complexity of Nash equilibria, the complexity of simple stochastic games as well as other fixed points at the intersection of the complexity classes known as PLS and PPAD, and the complexity of market equilibria for constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility functions, are evading existing techniques. Furthering our understanding of rational behavior in large systems will necessarily involve developing novel algorithmic and complexity-theoretic tools to meet the challenges posed by these problems.","title":"CAREER: Towards a Constructive Theory of Networked Interactions","awardID":"0953960","effectiveDate":"2010-02-01","expirationDate":"2015-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7796","name":"ALGORITHMIC FOUNDATIONS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7932","name":"COMPUT GAME THEORY & ECON"}}],"PIcoPI":["478035"],"PO":["565251"]},"161809":{"abstract":"The economic model of network services, both services for basic connectivity as well as application layer services delivered via the network, is undergoing a period of unprecedented change. For instance, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that offer services such as voice over IP are deciding to use proprietary forms of service differentiation to improve these service offerings over those of competitors. As more ISPs implement service differentiation in a proprietary way, there is a danger that the opportunity to have a coherent architectural approach to service differentiation will be lost. This issue is tied to the net neutrality debate, in which one core issue is how ISPs and content\/application service providers should share revenue. Some fundamental questions include the following. What are the market effects of having only competition between proprietary service stacks versus having competition at each layer? What architectural principles should be established in law or standards to induce the development of a market structure that results in higher welfare for all the stakeholders? Should both standard interfaces and\/or charging practices be enforced between providers? This project investigates questions such as these in order to achieve a more complete understanding of the coupling of architecture and economics in network services. The project develops game theoretic models of the interaction of selfish users and providers, and then uses these models to understand the welfare effects of different architectural choices. The results of this project will inform the development of both the architecture and market structure of the network services industry.","title":"CAREER: Markets for Network Services","awardID":"0953884","effectiveDate":"2010-02-01","expirationDate":"2015-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1640","name":"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARC"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}}],"PIcoPI":[432638],"PO":["564993"]},"159280":{"abstract":"Rice University leads a collaborative proposal to extend the impact of the Empowering Leadership: Computing Scholars of Tomorrow Alliance (ELA) through partnerships with new institutions and regional collaboratives that will adopt and expand ELA's successful models of engagement.

In response, this project seeks to design an alternative cultural pathway into the subject -- a pathway that does not purport to change or even implicitly criticize the existing CS culture, but rather seeks to provide a very different culture through which new populations (and especially females) can become fascinated with computing.

The work will build upon ongoing efforts to create accessible, powerful tools and materials that allow users to design and build their own programmable interactive fashion. The types of projects that users undertake within this alternative culture of computer science are rich in content, but refreshingly nontraditional: they are tangible, colorful, dramatic, richly interactive, and beautiful. This project proposes to encourage the growth of this new culture via two complementary avenues of work: the development of a visual programming environment for the LilyPad Arduino (a toolkit developed by the PIs that enables people to build e-textiles) and the development, dissemination, and evaluation of an \"E-textiles in-a-Box\" kit for educators.

Simulation can assist in designing and testing socio-technical systems by allowing the potential space of outcomes to be explored under given designs. Agent-based models have been developed as a method for building models of complex systems, with great success. Agents may be designed to represent system components and to specify the interactions between them in an incredible level of detail. While popular, the full potential of the methodology to support engineering of complex systems has not been reached, however, because of a set of key challenges. First, there exists a relative lack of robust methods for calibrating agent-based models to theory. Second, there is a paucity of reliable approaches for extracting coarse-grained, system level information as it emerges in agent-based simulations. Third, there is a dearth of schemes for handling uncertainty in the application of agent-based rules to system behavior. Fourth, computation of agent-based models is inefficient when agents are numerous in volume and richly-specified in behavior. Together, these impediments constrain the ability of agent-based modeling to enable prediction, to support decisions, and to facilitate the design, control, and optimization of complex systems. The main objective of this project is to broaden the extensibility of agent-based modeling beyond these constraints. This will be achieved by developing novel computational methods to fuse agent-based modeling, uncertainty measurement and quantification, and mathematics for pattern-extraction. <br\/><br\/>This project will expand the capabilities of agent-based modeling in supporting the design, engineering, and testing of complex systems. Our initial focus is to develop a prototype scheme that can be applied to complex socio-behavioral systems, but the project is of potential relevance across a diverse array of substantive areas. Indeed, one of our central aims is to provide the glue that can bridge diverse schemes for agent-based simulation across application areas. This could be incredibly useful in reconciling agent-based modeling into a larger ?ecology? of mathematical modeling and computation, fundamentally expanding the range of questions that can be posed and systems that can be explored in simulation, while better linking simulation to real-world dynamics.","title":"EAGER\/Collaborative Research: Accelerating Innovation in Agent-Based Simulations: Application to Complex Socio-Behavioral Phenomena","awardID":"1002469","effectiveDate":"2010-02-01","expirationDate":"2011-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0503","name":"Division of SHARED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE","abbr":"SCI"},"pgm":{"id":"1271","name":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS"}},{"dir":{"id":"07","name":"Directorate for DIRECTORATE FOR ENGINEERING             ","abbr":"ENG"},"div":{"id":"0703","name":"Division of CIVIL, MECHANICAL, & MANUFACT","abbr":"CMMI"},"pgm":{"id":"7478","name":"DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["545921"],"PO":["564988"]},"168474":{"abstract":"Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP) acts as an international forum to promote parallel processing research and education, and participates in setting up technical standards in this area.

Computer science in the United States is an overwhelmingly male discipline. Many of the the crucial factors in this gender imbalance are cultural; that is, the culture that has grown up around computer science has a variety of attributes that appeal more to males than females. In response, this project seeks to design an alternative cultural pathway into the subject -- a pathway that does not purport to change or even implicitly criticize the existing CS culture, but rather seeks to provide a very different culture through which new populations (and especially females) can become fascinated with computing. Specifically, this project will develop and disseminate tools for engaging people in computing through the medium of fabrics and electronic textiles (or e-textiles). The work will build upon ongoing efforts to create accessible, powerful tools and materials that allow users to design and build their own programmable interactive fashion. The types of projects that users undertake within this alternative culture of computer science are rich in content, but refreshingly nontraditional: they are tangible, colorful, dramatic, richly interactive, and beautiful. This project proposes to encourage the growth of this new culture via two complementary avenues of work: the development of a visual programming environment for the LilyPad Arduino (a toolkit developed by the PIs that enables people to build e-textiles) and the development, dissemination, and evaluation of an \"E-textiles in-a-Box\" kit for educators. This kit will be disseminated through the large network developed by the National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT) and its effectiveness will be assessed by NCWIT's social science team. These efforts are crucial next steps in engaging a broad audience in e-textiles and -- via this engagement -- a new and diverse audience in computing.","title":"Collaborative Research: BPC-DP: A Cultural Shift in Computer Science: Introducing Computation through E-Textiles","awardID":"0940520","effectiveDate":"2010-02-01","expirationDate":"2014-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7482","name":"BROADENING PARTIC IN COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["469513"],"PO":["561855"]},"169641":{"abstract":"This award will support the dissemination of Dr. Liskov's research on symmetric cryptography, which was supported previously by award CNS-0845662.
