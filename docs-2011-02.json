{"175241":{"abstract":"There is an increasing trend towards federated distributed systems, i.e., systems that are operated jointly by multiple different organizations or individuals. The interests of the participants in such a system are often highly diverse and\/or in conflict with one another; for example, participants may be business competitors or based in hostile nations. Thus, federated systems are inherently vulnerable to insider attacks: the participants can try to subvert the system, exploit it for their own benefit, or attack other participants.<br\/><br\/>However, the participants in a federated system are typically connected in the 'offline world' as well, e.g., through social networks or business relationships. This context can be leveraged to handle misbehavior through well-known, time-tested techniques like accountability and transparency. For example, if one participant can detect and prove that another participant has misbehaved, she can sue that participant for breach of contract.<br\/><br\/>The goal of this research is to develop a key technology for enabling this approach, namely a reliable and general way to generate and verify evidence of misbehavior in federated systems. The project (i) studies the fundamental tradeoffs, requirements, and inherent costs of creating evidence; (ii) develops new algorithms for efficiently supporting different kinds of evidence; and (iii) evaluates these algorithms in the context of practical systems.<br\/><br\/>The project is integrated with Penn's new undergraduate program in Market and Social Systems Engineering. It will produce and freely distribute software that can be used to defend federated systems against attacks and malicious insiders.","title":"CAREER: Evidence in Federated Distributed Systems","awardID":"1054229","effectiveDate":"2011-02-01","expirationDate":"2016-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"8060","name":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace"}}],"PIcoPI":["475279"],"PO":["565327"]},"175274":{"abstract":"The focus of the proposed research is to develop a computational framework that allows for the systematic exploration of the growing human \"physiome\" for clues to predict and prevent major diseases. This research is motivated by the observation that despite recent progress in medicine, the disease burden of many important clinical conditions remains unacceptably high because of a failure to promptly match patients to treatments that are appropriate to their current condition or their individual risk. This situation is true of many different areas of medicine: in cardiology, over 300,000 deaths take place each year due to fatal arrhythmias; in psychiatry, 34% of patients with bipolar disorder have an interval longer than 10 years before they first receive a diagnosis; in the setting of intensive care, there are over 650,00 cases of unanticipated sepsis each year. These are only some examples, where the therapies to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs exist, but are often not applied in a timely fashion due to the absence of adequate information-based tools to guide their use.<br\/><br\/>There is a critical need in this setting for novel biomarkers to guide decision-making. Particularly striking is the lack of good biomarkers that exploit recent advances in acquiring large physiological datasets continuously from patients over long periods. The existing practice of discovering disease markers in such data is highly dependent on human input and subjective abilities; inappropriate for large datasets and subtle markers; and unable to generalize for different systems and diseases. The goal of this research is to bridge this gap, through computational methods for the structured discovery of novel, highly-discriminative risk markers from terabytes and even potentially petabytes of physiological data.<br\/><br\/>Inspired by the translational impact of computational biology in extracting valuable insights from large volumes of genomic and proteomic data, this research endeavors to lay the foundations of a complementary body of research focused around a vision of \"computational physiomics\". The PI proposes a computational framework where large volumes of waveform data are first abstracted into a uniform string representation, and the resulting physiological text is then studied for characteristics associated with risk. The abstraction of physiological signals into text creates the opportunity to study these signals in a fundamentally different manner from earlier efforts (and to thereby discover new insights). As part of this work, the PI will address the challenges associated with transforming the many different kinds of physiological time-series signals (e.g., quasi-periodic, aperiodic, non-uniformly sampled, multi-channel) into symbolic sequences, registering these symbols across patients, formulating problems relating to risk stratification in the context of textual data, and developing algorithms to efficiently and accurately solve these problem statements. In addition, through extensive collaborations with clinical colleagues, he will rigorously evaluate the clinical utility of the research on real-world datasets drawn from different high-impact clinical applications.<br\/><br\/>Early investigation of the ideas that form the basis of the proposed work have shown great promise for cardiovascular applications. Clinical studies in two separate cohorts with nearly 6,000 patients show that the computational framework enables the discovery of risk markers from ECG signals that identify patients at an 8-9 fold increased risk of death within three months of a heart attack, and moreover, that this information is independent of other generally accepted risk variables (e.g., demographics, comorbidities, imaging results, biomarkers, other ECG variables etc.). The research should enable continued progress in the case of cardiovascular disease, as well as similar progress for other focus applications (e.g., psychiatry, critical care, neurology, and obstetrics) through clinical collaborations. In addition to impact in these specific cases, the research also lays the foundation of a broader body of research (i.e., the vision of \"computational physiomics\") that can transform medical data analysis by including large volumes of continuous physiological signals in a rubric that today can only handle discrete data. This research represents a central piece in this context that connects advances in continuous patient monitoring to advances in classification methods. While the research is motivated by clinical applications, the computational questions addressed by the work and the techniques will also advance existing work on time-series prediction and on sequential data mining and machine learning more generally. The challenge of extracting insights from large volumes of time-series data is increasingly important across many different disciplines.

The research program combines computer science techniques designed to optimize the mining of online information with economic analysis and policy evaluation techniques. The research will advance and synergize literatures in each of these fields, and apply these advances to the important academic topic of measuring the likely effect of privacy regulation and other governmental attempts to safeguard digital data.

This will lead to clearer guidance for policymakers seeking to improve the design of privacy laws, and better practices for firms trying to retain a viable business model while safeguarding consumers' privacy. The research program will enable websites to use consumer data in ways that improve consumers' experience of online advertising, rather than unintentionally creating situations where consumers feel that their privacy has been violated. It will help guide privacy regulation directed at protecting the most vulnerable types of digital consumer data, such as digitized patient records, from unintentional security risks.<br\/><br\/> The educational program will create a new mentoring program for undergraduate and graduate students, focusing especially on recruiting undergraduate and graduate women and under-represented minorities with an interest in the intersection between information systems and public policy. It also involves a specialized digital data and privacy course at MIT Sloan School of Management, introducing a generation of students to new complexities raised by protecting privacy when digitization automates the collection of potentially personal data. It is increasingly important for business students to come to grips with the privacy challenges and the business practices encountered when using the Internet, and such course development will assist in that process. A graduate student seminar will help more technically-minded students understand the nuances of applying policy evaluation techniques to IS policy issues. The data, results and educational exercises resulting from this proposal will be made available to the broader academic community, to further disseminate the planned research and teaching advances.","title":"CAREER Digital Privacy and Regulation","awardID":"1053398","effectiveDate":"2011-02-01","expirationDate":"2016-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["520821"],"PO":["565227"]},"175352":{"abstract":"Multithreaded programs are becoming increasingly critical driven by the<br\/>rise of multicore hardware and the coming storm of cloud computing.<br\/>Unfortunately, these programs remain difficult to write, test, and debug.<br\/>A key reason for this difficulty is nondeterminism: different runs of a<br\/>multithreaded program may show different behaviors depending on how the<br\/>threads interleave.

At the core of most NLP systems is a parser, a program which identifies the grammatical structure of sentences. Parsing is an essential prerequisite for language understanding.

This CAREER project aims to advance parsing by developing novel methods of indirect supervision to overcome the lack of labeled training data, as well as new kinds of models which incorporate information about the prior linguistic context in which sentences appear. It employs Bayesian techniques, which give robust estimates and allow rich parametrization, and applies them to lexicalized grammars, which provide a compact representation of the syntactic properties of a language.<br\/>This CAREER project will also train graduate students in natural language processing and develop materials that can be used to teach middle and high school students about NLP and to inspire them to pursue an education in computer science.","title":"CAREER: Bayesian Models for Lexicalized Grammars","awardID":"1053856","effectiveDate":"2011-02-01","expirationDate":"2016-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7495","name":"ROBUST INTELLIGENCE"}}],"PIcoPI":["511678"],"PO":["565215"]},"179488":{"abstract":"The project funds two related activities for US-based graduate students: (1) attendance at the doctoral consortium at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), where students discuss their research with senior members of the community, network with students from around the world, and discuss issues related to ethics in computing research; (2) extended research visits to European research groups, where students are exposed to new research paradigms and approaches within artificial intelligence and robotics, and build bridges between the European host and their own research group for long term cooperation. <br\/><br\/>The goals of the project are to give students a clearer idea of what ethical dilemmas they may encounter as computer scientists; meet other students and professionals; have the opportunity to present their work to others in related research subfields; receive feedback from a senior member of their research community.

Unfortunately, the extreme complexity of this software leads to a highly rich variety of hard-to-isolate failure modes and anomalies, turning the operation of a modern large-scale networked system into a constant process of finding and fixing problems. Research on debugging modern networked systems has thus far focused on \"removing the human from the loop\" by automatically detecting problems that violate predefined correctness conditions. However in practice, the enormous complexity of networks coupled with the fundamental need for domain-specific knowledge to localize problems limits the applicability of existing research, leaving debugging today a painstakingly manual process.<br\/><br\/>In this work, the researchers take a very different approach; namely, the position that manual labor is a necessary evil of debugging problems in networked systems, but that this process would be vastly simpler with in-network support for debugging. In this vein, the work develops techniques and tools for interactive debugging of wide area networked systems. Networked software presents new challenges for interactive debugging, including determining an ordering and global view of events in the face of high dynamism and extremely large scale, enabling the troubleshooter to interactively understand the underlying problems present in inherently massive and potentially incomplete sets of observations, localizing problems in the presence of competitors and adversaries that may subvert or limit information available to the debugger, and isolating the operational network's performance from the debugging process.<br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: This project will design the first interactive debugging system for modern networked systems. This work will make significant contributions to network architecture and protocol design, including: (a) a network-layer substrate that allows for tight controls on network execution, to provide reproducibility and performance isolation of the live network in highly distributed and dynamic environments; (b) extensions to support debugging in untrusted environments, to localize malicious behavior and to diagnose faults without requiring revelation of private inputs; (c) analytical models to fundamentally understand the level of diagnostics achievable in existing systems, and to redesign existing protocols for diagnosability; and (d) a characterization of faults in modern networks, and of human factors that slow the debugging process or harm diagnostic precision. This work will also produce new software and tools for interactive debugging of networked systems that will be made open-source.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: Network and service providers today spend billions of dollars hiring armies of highly skilled developers and troubleshooters. Being able to troubleshoot more efficiently reduces network downtime, improving reliability and cost-effectiveness of networking technologies. Networks that can be rapidly repaired after exceptions are an essential component of disaster survival and recovery for business and government communication systems. Simplifying network troubleshooting can also accelerate deployment of networks in underdeveloped regions lacking experienced technicians.

One central aspect of this type of research, in contrast to other realms of applied research, is that it is theoretically driven and feeds back to our theoretical understandings; as such, real world research fortifies our understanding of people, robots, and interaction between the two.

To these ends, the workshop will include sessions in a variety of formats. Attendees will hear short talks from 5 selected student participants; those students not invited to give an oral presentation will participate in an interactive poster session. A panel of four senior researchers will share their expertise and insights on how to address the interdisciplinary challenge of HRI. In the afternoon, workshop attendees will be divided into groups of 3-5 members with diverse backgrounds for a breakout session in which they will be asked to design integrative projects that build upon their own submissions and which span the various sub-fields of HRI (e.g., assistive robotics, urban search and rescue, etc.) The presentation session afterward will allow 10-15 minutes for each breakout group to present a summary to the entire workshop; the organizers anticipate that the discussions will continue during dinner.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This workshop will afford a unique opportunity for the best of the next generation of researchers in human-robot interaction to be exposed to and discuss current and relevant topics as they are being studied in several different research communities (including but nor limited to computer science and engineering, psychology, robotics, human factors and ergonomics, and human-computer interaction). This is important for the field, because it has been recognized that transformative advances in research in this fledgling area can only come through the melding of cross-disciplinary knowledge and multinational perspectives. Participants will be encouraged to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development, to form collaborative relationships, and to generate new research questions to be addressed during the coming years. Participants will also gain leadership and service experience, as the workshop is largely student organized and student led. The PI will act aggressively to recruit young researchers from minority and underrepresented groups in order to assure diversity of the participants across a variety of dimensions, so that the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field.

Looking Glass is a novice programming environment that presents programming as a means to the motivating end of creating 3D animated stories. In the system to be developed, mentors will do three things: First, a mentor watches the story-programs his or her mentee created and writes a code suggestion: new or revised functionality that will help to improve the mentees' programs. Next, the mentor edits a draft tutorial that Looking Glass has automatically generated from the mentor's code suggestion. Looking Glass then sends this edited tutorial to the mentee. Finally, the mentor writes rules that help Looking Glass identify contexts in which that code suggestion could be helpful. Looking Glass will use the mentor-contributed code suggestions, personalized tutorials, and rules to provide virtual mentoring for independent learners. Specifically, this project will explore three hypotheses: <br\/><br\/>Hypothesis One: The approach of capturing and evaluating mentor-created learning materials will enable the creation of a virtual mentoring system to support independent learners. <br\/><br\/>Hypothesis Two: Independent learners who are presented with in-context code suggestions that both further their stories and introduce new programming concepts will develop greater programming skills than those without access to these suggestions. <br\/><br\/>Hypothesis Three: Independent learners who are presented with personalized tutorials based on their experience level with each topic presented will perform better than independent learners who are presented with a single level of scaffolding. <br\/><br\/>The National Academy of Engineering lists personalized learning as one of the grand challenges for engineering in this century. This project will develop and evaluate the impact of two techniques for personalizing learning: program-specific code suggestions and personalized, multi-level tutorials. The majority of research into educational environments has focused on formal educational settings, but Looking Glass will advance research in how to effectively support independent learning in open-ended software environments. The enhancement to Looking Glass will provide an environment for exploring computer programming and learning support through virtual mentoring to middle school children without access to computer science learning opportunities.

This is the key to designing smart and reliable control. By providing such analytic foundations, this project addresses an intellectual grand challenge that has substantial scientific, economical, societal, and educational impact arising from the benefits of improved CPS analysis and design.

The performance of many DC applications (e.g, high-performance computing applications) directly depends on the underlying network performance; managing data center network (DCN) performance efficiently is therefore of utmost importance. Managing DCN performance is challenging because many DCN applications such as cloud-based Web services, storage applications, high performance computing, and financial trading applications require latencies of the order of 10s of microseconds, in contrast with ISP network applications that require latency guarantees within few 100s of milliseconds. Thus, tools and techniques developed for monitoring ISP networks alone are insufficient for high-fidelity measurements in the DCN context. <br\/><br\/>Intellectual Merit: The goal of this project is to investigate novel tools and techniques that will help build a high-fidelity knowledge plane for data centers. Specifically, the knowledge plane will collect high-fidelity measurements by equipping DCN switches with low-cost primitives for direct measurement of latency and loss properties. The knowledge plane will allow operators to perform fault diagnosis, service level agreement (SLA) monitoring, traffic engineering, network provisioning and other such management tasks in modern data center networks in an accurate and automated fashion. The up-to-date knowledge of the data center network performance will also help in building effective scheduling and performance-aware job placement algorithms to improve the performance of various DC applications.<br\/><br\/>The project will investigate the following key building blocks for the construction of the knowledge plane: (1) It will develop novel scalable primitives for latency and loss measurements that can be implemented in switches at high speed. It will focus on measurements across interfaces pairs within a switch as well as across switches that may have multiple paths between them. (2) It will explore novel per-flow or per-class differentiated latency measurements in multi-tenant environments that require SLA guarantees on a per-customer basis. It will also investigate scalable primitives for obtaining per-packet measurements in switches; together these primitives will be transformational in debugging and measurement support in managing mission-critical DCNs. (3) To ensure scalability of the knowledge plane; the project will also investigate mechanisms for scalable export of measurement information, including primitives for querying network devices for information as opposed to a `push'-based approach.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impact: The research outcomes of this project will help ease the management of data center applications significantly, thereby reducing cost and increasing the reliability and performance of data center services. The results of this project are timely as well as cloud computing is poised to bring about a renaissance in distributed and parallel computing in large-scale multi-tenant clouds.

The single most predominant strategy is to place the errors into regions which can better hide the compression artifacts, an approach which can be guided by computational models of early\/low-level HVS processing. The inherent assumption in this approach is that the consumer is looking for the distortion in the presence of the image. However, in actuality, the consumer is looking at the image in the presence of possible distortion, which is a fundamentally different perceptual task that requires a fundamentally different HVS model. Next-generation coding schemes which can take into account higher-level aspects such as content-adaptive masking; perceptual importance across space, frequency, and time; and elements of cognition; have the potential to dramatically reduce storage and bandwidth requirements while maximizing visual quality and the overall multimedia experience. In this project, the investigator researches how compression artifacts influence the HVS's ability to process and interpret images and video. Three main areas are investigated: (1) new models of visual masking which take into account image recognition; (2) appearance-preserving strategies of data quantization; and (3) analysis and quantization strategies which honor rules of visual cognition derived from quality-rating experiments coupled with eye-tracking. This research is integrated with an educational component that promotes student development in applying knowledge of human vision to engineering problems. Two new interdisciplinary graduate-level courses, an interdisciplinary summer workshop, and undergraduate research projects and curriculum reform are made available to students. Two multimedia-driven competitions that expose K-12 students and undergraduates to image-processing research are also made available.","title":"CAREER: Content-Based Image and Video Coding Using Higher-Level Models of Human Vision","awardID":"1054612","effectiveDate":"2011-02-01","expirationDate":"2016-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7797","name":"COMM & INFORMATION FOUNDATIONS"}}],"PIcoPI":[470095],"PO":["564898"]},"175348":{"abstract":"CAREER: Programming Nucleic Acids Self-Assembly<br\/><br\/>The objective of this proposal is to develop platforms for engineering programmable synthetic molecular devices self-assembled from nucleic acid molecules (DNA and RNA), and for exploiting these devices to do useful molecular work.

We envision the day when such technology envelops society, and in concert empower individuals to function more effectively both individually and as members of society. In essence the projected infra-structure will allow us to investigate this future.<br\/><br\/>In a sense, technologically savvy users already construct ecologies for themselves in an ad hoc manner. We ensure that hand-held devices we carry will synchronize with our larger devices like laptops and desktops. We ensure data exchange among the various applications we use, and we create personal and group workflows among our computational environments. We keep appropriate adaptors so that our portable devices have access to the projection screens or group displays in our work environment. We learn the interaction that is needed on each platform to ensure cross-platform interactivity. Finally, we organize our work and life around these interoperations ? synching our iPods and iPads periodically, selecting applications on each platform to support the way we work and our lifestyle as a whole. The challenge of this proposal is to remove the ad hoc nature of the construction of such one-of-a-kind ecologies.<br\/><br\/>Our proposed infrastructure comprises two related subgroups. First, we propose a Rapid Prototyping Laboratory (RPL) where faculty and students can develop new devices to populate the ecologies. The RPL will support electronic and single-board-computer designs, printed-circuit board prototyping, and 3D object construction. Second, we will construct the larger environment to be populated by these devices. This environment includes a variety of large to personal display technologies and a set of tracking technologies to enable devices to situate themselves in space.<br\/><br\/>We have assembled two sets of research projects that benefit from this infrastructure. First we inves-tigate how our envisioned ecologies may be realized. We will study how this myriad of technologies may interoperate to give the user a set of consistent expectations of interaction across devices and display environments. We shall also investigate HCI methodologies for humans to function within the 3D world populated by devices and displays. Our second set of projects investigates various uses of our envi-sioned ecologies. Extending the ecology analogy, each use scenario furnishes a habitat that contextual-izes the ecologies within it. We advance a set of research areas: education and learning; universal access; insight formation; smart homes; usable security; mediated social interaction; and electronic-textiles to furnish such contexts where technology-interoperation and user-interaction may be explored.<br\/><br\/>An important aspect of this project is to encourage a kind of computational thinking among our re-searchers and students that span the digital and physical environment.

Recent investigations have characterized silicon integrated on-chip antennas operating in the millimeter (mm)-wave range of 50-110 GHz, and this is now a viable technology.

Towards this end, we are<br\/>developing a home network measurement infrastructure consisting of (1)<br\/>customized routers deployed in homes and (2) a central data collection<br\/>server. We are deploying both the measurement infrastructure across<br\/>hundreds of homes and collecting a corpus of active and passive<br\/>measurements that will shed more light into home network performance and<br\/>use. Given the proliferation of network devices in the home and the<br\/>general public's growing attention to the performance of access<br\/>networks, we expect that the infrastructure that we deploy and the data<br\/>that we gather from this infrastructure will play in important role in<br\/>improving our collective understanding of how home networks are used and<br\/>how well they perform. We will disseminate our results through<br\/>conference and journal publications, as well as talks with and<br\/>presentations to researchers, policymakers, and practitioners.","title":"CRI-II-NEW: Collaborative Research: Measurement Infrastructure for Home Networks","awardID":"1059350","effectiveDate":"2011-02-15","expirationDate":"2014-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7359","name":"COMPUTING RES INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":[472141,"561756"],"PO":["564778"]},"176162":{"abstract":"As part of this planning project, the PIs test the feasibility of collecting a corpus of conversational speech including both broadcast and telephone conversations.

The investigator addresses problems in the area of network forensics that arise in packet-based communication of information. A key feature of the research approach is the use of timing as an under-utilized degree of freedom that provides rich statistical structure about the information dynamics. Using timing modality for performing network forensics has the advantage that it will not excessively perturb normal operation in packet networks where the information exchange is achieved via packet contents. A novelty of this research is the inclusion of causal inference. Human judgments about the likelihood of events and dependencies among variables is strongly influenced by the perception of cause-effect relationships. To extend the same decision making power, a man-made system must acquire the ability to process cause-effect relationships, rather than only assessing questions of statistical dependence. PI's objective is to understand causal influences between network flows using the timing modality. <br\/>The PI will embark on an ambitious multidisciplinary research program that targets both theoretical and practical fundamental problems in security. The main research endeavors undertaken by the PI are: (1) analysis and mitigation of queuing timing side channels that arise in presence of shared resources; (2) develop of causal inference metrics and algorithms for complex networks; (3) design of efficient compression and storage approaches for network flows using good compression codes for point processes; (4) design of network flow watermarks that will be inserted in packet timings and serve the dual purpose of providing data integrity as well as a means for network inference.","title":"CAREER: A Timing Approach to Network Forensics","awardID":"1054937","effectiveDate":"2011-02-01","expirationDate":"2016-01-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7795","name":"TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7797","name":"COMM & INFORMATION FOUNDATIONS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"8060","name":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace"}}],"PIcoPI":["475207"],"PO":["564898"]},"178682":{"abstract":"Funds are requested to provide limted support to US based students to participate in CADathlon contest. <br\/><br\/>CADathlon is an annual graduate student programming contest held in conjunction with the ICCAD (International Conference on Computer-Aided Design) conference held annually in SanJose, California.

In Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS) this tessellation (or finite element mesh) is a critical component for patient-specific bio-mechanics and bio-fluid finite element (FE) simulations. In this project, we target I2M conversion for image guided neurosurgery and endoscopic neck and head surgery. Specifically, we focus on FE-based non-rigid registration methods which use patient-specific bio-mechanical models to fuse pre-operative intra-operative brain images (eg. Magnetic Resonance Images and\/or Computed Tomography Scans).<br\/><br\/>The objective of this project is to extend the Delaunay refinement algorithms and theory for guaranteed quality I2M conversion that meets additional requirements related to: (1) accuracy of non-rigid registration of brain images, and (2) real-time constrains imposed by neurosurgery or head and neck surgery. The intellectual merit of this work is the development of novel theoretical framework which extends existing point insertion methods for both scalar and parallel guaranteed quality Delaunay mesh generation. These extensions increase algorithm flexibility which is important to satisfy application-specific requirements like fidelity.<br\/><br\/>The proposal will have a broader impact on several areas in both CAS and Computer Aided Design (CAD). Non-rigid registration of medical images is an enabling technology for many applications in CAS which is a rapidly growing area in health care industry. Our algorithms will contribute in the prevention of medical errors and the<br\/>use of new (more effective\/accurate) technologies which can lead to products (i.e., image guided neuro-navigation systems) that will help reduce medical and hospitalization expenses. Specifically, (1) image guided neurosurgery increases the percentage of successful tumor resections while minimizing the potential for neurological deficit by preserving critical tissue and hence improves prognosis for patient, and (2) minimally invasive endoscopic surgery results in less blood loss and reduced post-operative pain lead to faster recovery and earlier discharge of patients. In addition technology based on our I2M conversion algorithms can be used in medical simulators which can improve doctor training and minimize errors in medical procedures.","title":"AF:Small:A Novel Algorithmic Approach for Real-Time Image-to-Mesh Conversion of Brain MRI","awardID":"1139864","effectiveDate":"2011-02-01","expirationDate":"2014-08-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7934","name":"PARAL\/DISTRIBUTED ALGORITHMS"}}],"PIcoPI":["561580"],"PO":["565157"]},"176153":{"abstract":"As part of this planning project, the PIs test the feasibility of collecting a corpus of conversational speech including both broadcast and telephone conversations.
