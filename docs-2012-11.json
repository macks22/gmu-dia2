{"200200":{"abstract":"There are many types of disabilities caused by arthritis, where systematic physical activity and physical therapy are essential to preventing further deterioration. The challenge here is that periods of severe pain are an obstacle to such activities. The relationship between pain and physical activity is very tricky; it typically involves all joints (e.g., hands, wrists, feet, knees) and is a major cause of reduced quality of life and disability. This is the case with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), a chronic systemic inflammatory disease, where preserving functional range of motion and enhancing cardiovascular health are primary goals of physical therapy. Persons with RA who exercise regularly show not only improvements in muscle strength and overall physical and health function, but also reduced mortality. But it has been shown that long-term engagement in exercise among patients with RA is poor and does not exceed 50% when patients are not supervised. This results in a huge cost to national health care and to national productivity. <br\/><br\/>The PI argues that computer technology (tools and interfaces) can help the RA patient remain motivated and maintain movement. In this exploratory project her team will develop some of the components for motion capture and data integration that will eventually be integrated into a system called RPLAY which will enable patients with RA to perform physical therapy at home while the system accurately monitors their joint motions, motor performance and other physiological indicators. Specific objectives include: development of preliminary tools for human-centric adaptive remote monitoring, including facial, hand, arm, and body motions, and range of motion; development of prototype interactive games to encourage patient rehabilitation, and of a prototype user interface through which the patient and therapist can communicate via avatars to promote physical activity; and development of tools for validating the physical therapy monitoring and assessment results and their integration into a visualization and report system. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This project addresses issues of human joint pain and physical inactivity, which adversely affect the everyday lives of millions of people. It will lay the foundations for integrating disparate human data of persons in similar conditions, which will advance and extend the relationship between engineering innovation and computational analysis. The project will provide a training experience for computer science PhD students in modeling human motion in innovative ways. The project will also lead to an interdisciplinary course for physical therapy and computer science students on improving health delivery and rehabilitation practices.","title":"EAGER: An Exploratory Pilot Project to Build Human-Centric Physical Activity Monitoring Tools for Enhancing Rehabilitation Therapy Engagement and Assessment","awardID":"1258500","effectiveDate":"2012-11-01","expirationDate":"2014-10-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["560636","558118","229551"],"PO":["565227"]},"198100":{"abstract":"DataBridge<br\/><br\/>There are currently thousands of scientists creating millions of data sets describing an increasingly diverse matrix of social and physical phenomena. This rapid increase in both amount and diversity of data implies a corresponding increase in the potential of data to empower important new collaborative research initiatives. However, the sheer volume and diversity of data presents a new set of challenges in locating all of the data relevant to a particular line of research. Taking full advantage of the unique data managed by the \"long-tail of science\" requires new tools specifically created to assist scientists in their search for relevant data sets. DataBridge is an e-science collaboration environment tool designed specifically for the exploration of a rich set of sociometric tools and the corresponding space of relevance algorithms, and their adaptation to define semantic bridges that link large numbers of diverse datasets into a sociometric network. Data from several large NSF funded projects will be analyzed to develop relevance-based data discovery methods. Sociometric network analysis (SNA) algorithms will be used to explore the space of relevancy (different ways data can be related to each other) by metadata and ontology, by pattern analysis and feature extraction, and via human connections. By linking data, human interactions, and usage methods and practices, rich models of social networks inter-connecting massive long tail science data can be created that enhance scientific collaboration and discovery. DataBridge supports advances in Science and Engineering by directly enabling and improving discovery of relevant scientific data across large, distributed and diverse collections. The system will also provide an easy means of publishing data to the DataBridge and incentivize data producers to do so by enabling collaboration and citation. The design will be domain-agnostic and highly extensible and adaptive, supporting inclusion of new relevance algorithms and indexing techniques. DataBridge will be distributed under an open source license enabling wider use and crowd-sourced improvements of the technology. The concepts developed in the project - semantically linking data through sociometric network analysis - will have an impact on non-scientific data collections and will effectively improve access and discovery of information over the web.","title":"BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: ESCE: DCM: Collaborative Research: DataBridge - A Sociometric System for Long-Tail Science Data Collections","awardID":"1247663","effectiveDate":"2012-11-01","expirationDate":"2015-10-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"8083","name":"Big Data Science &Engineering"}}],"PIcoPI":[531638],"PO":["565292"]},"196385":{"abstract":"The goal of this research is to develop fundamental theory, efficient algorithms, and realistic<br\/>experiments for the analysis and design of safety-critical cyber-physical transportation systems<br\/>with human operators.

The project integrates ideas from economics and behavioral science into frameworks grounded in control theory and power systems. Our central construct is that of a ?resource cluster,? a collection of distributed resources (ex: solar PV, storage, deferrable loads) that can be coordinated to efficiently and reliably offer services (ex: power delivery) in the face of uncertainty (ex: PV output, consumer behavior).

For over a decade, ISMAR (and its forerunner events, IWAR\/ISAR and ISMR) has been the premier international conference on research into the science, technology, applications and uses of Mixed Reality (MR) and Augmented Reality (AR). The proliferation of powerful mobile hardware has opened up new avenues of research into MR and AR while enabling corporate and consumer applications on a wide scale. Across this spectrum fascinating new types of user interfaces, technologies, and concepts are beginning to emerge. The field is highly interdisciplinary in nature, bringing together technologists, educators, humanists, artists and social scientists, among others. ISMAR is one of the largest meetings devoted to the advancement of mixed reality, augmented reality, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction with the physical world, and encourages six different submission types: Papers and Posters, Workshops, Panels, Tutorials, Demonstrations and Contests. Because of the diverse fields relevant to mixed and augmented reality, ISMAR content is organized in two tracks: The Science & Technology (S&T) program and The Arts, Media and Humanities (AMH) program. The top papers are often extended, reviewed, and submitted for publication in the prestigious IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics. More information about the conference may be found at http:\/\/ismar.vgtc.org\/. <br\/><br\/>This will be the first Doctoral Consortium held in conjunction with an ISMAR symposium. The goal is to provide the students with an opportunity at a critical time in their careers to present their work to a group of mentors and peers from a diverse set of academic and industrial institutions, to receive feedback on their doctoral research plan and progress, and to build a cohort of young researchers within the ISMAR community. To these ends participants will be asked to prepare both a technical presentation and a poster describing their work. A pre-event social dinner on Sunday evening will allow the attendees (students, mentors and organizers) to get to know each other. On Monday morning the attendees will meet for an informal breakfast at 8:00 AM, after which each student participant will have 50 minutes devoted to his\/her research, beginning with a presentation for approximately 30 minutes followed by about 20 minutes reserved for an extensive discussion with the other graduate student participants and the senior researchers. The discussion will be facilitated by the Doctoral Consortium co-chairs and mentors, with the goal of addressing the strengths and weaknesses of the research, challenges and issues, implications of the results, potential suggestions for additional approaches or follow-on work, and career guidance related to the student's work and area. The posters will be on display during the main ISMAR conference poster sessions (in which the students will be expected to participate), and will be marked as being part of the Doctoral Consortium. All results from the Consortium, including the procedures followed, will be archived in an ISMAR 2012 DC binder as a reference for the next year's conference.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The organizers will take steps to achieve a diversity of research topics, disciplinary backgrounds, methodological approaches, and home institutions among the students to ensure that they meet people outside their own specific area. Factors such as gender and ethnicity will also be taken into account, with an emphasis on including underrepresented groups. To further increase diversity up to half the student participants may be invited from abroad but NSF funds will be used to support the 4 expected students from U.S. institutions of higher learning plus one international student; the organizers will work with colleagues in Europe and Asia to secure other funding for the remaining international students.","title":"ISMAR 2012 Doctoral Consortium","awardID":"1261694","effectiveDate":"2012-11-15","expirationDate":"2013-10-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[538206],"PO":["565227"]},"202228":{"abstract":"The technological advances of the past decade have given rise to an increasing number of creative practices and research areas that seek to overcome the long-standing separation between the physical and digital worlds. One key area of innovation has been tangible computing, which pushes the user interface beyond the screen into the physical world by means of mobile devices, graspable interfaces and interactive surfaces. Closely related is embedded interaction in which the everyday objects and environments we interact with are computationally augmented in new ways. As physical artifacts acquire new computational behaviors, they become reprogrammable, customizable, repurposeable, and interoperable in rich ecologies and diverse contexts. They also become more complex, and require intense design effort in order to be functional, usable, and enjoyable.

Launched in 2007 and now in its seventh year, the annual TEI conference series is about creating compelling experiences that bridge bits and atoms through research in human-computer interaction, design, interactive arts, tools and technologies. TEI brings together researchers, designers, engineers, and artists who provide an innovative and cross-disciplinary perspective on physical\/digital interaction design and technological innovation. The intimate size of this single-track conference (about 200 participants in recent years) provides a unique forum for exchanging ideas through talks, interactive exhibits, demos, posters, art installations and performances.

On Sunday, students will present their research to their peers and the faculty mentors, who will constructively critique the students' work from diverse viewpoints. The students will also get to show their work in posters at the conference, and their short papers will be included in the conference Proceedings. A dinner event on Saturday evening before the Graduate Student Consortium will serve to set the stage for the following day's learning activity and allow participants to become acquainted with one another.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This workshop will sharpen the research skills of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and designers who will shape human-centered computing as it takes place in physical things and places. Already we are observing the impact of this field in our daily lives, as computing becomes embedded in our phones, our bus stops, and soon even our clothing. Now is a critical moment in the field, as a wave of early exploratory prototypes begins to give way to disciplined investigations, the development of toolkits, and more rigorous evaluation methods. Mentoring a next generation of TEI researchers is crucial if the field is to retain its initial vigor and openness as it gains foothold in the academic establishment of human-computing research. The TEI Graduate Consortium organizing committee will make special efforts to recruit a diverse set of student participants, particularly seeking members of groups that are under-represented in computer and information science and engineering, including women and members of U.S. minority populations. The committee is particularly concerned with increasing participation of underrepresented groups and will also ensure that the meeting is accessible to participants with disabilities.","title":"WORKSHOP: The TEI 2013 Graduate Student Consortium","awardID":"1302373","effectiveDate":"2012-11-15","expirationDate":"2013-10-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["552897"],"PO":["565227"]},"197785":{"abstract":"Clemson Next-Net models a next-generation evolutionary campus network and services for productive and innovative research and education.

These learning progressions are a necessary step towards the integration of computational thinking and computer science concepts into K-12. The project staff will develop two curricula - one for grades 2-6 and one for grades 4-6. The curricula and learning progressions will iteratively inform one another. Further, the curricula will be a proof of concept that students can develop computational thinking skills in a way that reinforces other academic subjects and their own culture, and provide a practical way for teachers to begin teaching computer science at different entry points within grades 2-6.<br\/><br\/>Computing has infiltrated almost all corners of life and is an increasingly important part of driving innovation, and the next generation of inventors need to understand how to develop and use software. The ability to analyze and express problems in a way compatible with software solutions, or computational thinking, will become critical in modern society. This work has the potential to revolutionize how computer science is taught in elementary schools by showing how these computational thinking skills can be developed in three or six years while supporting education in the existing curriculum. In addition, the resulting curricular materials will be developed with diverse students as the targets. First, the project staff will explore the prior knowledge that students with different backgrounds have, leading to everyday examples that are more accessible and meaningful to diverse students. Second, the content delivery will use the latest research in teaching diverse students computer science concepts.","title":"CER: DEPICT: Developing Elementary (Learning) Progressions to Integrate Computational Thinking","awardID":"1240985","effectiveDate":"2012-11-01","expirationDate":"2015-10-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7382","name":"Computing Ed for 21st Century"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1109","name":"Division of RESEARCH ON LEARNING","abbr":"DRL"},"pgm":{"id":"7645","name":"DISCOVERY RESEARCH K-12"}}],"PIcoPI":[528013,528014],"PO":["560704"]},"196514":{"abstract":"Large-scale critical infrastructure systems, including energy and transportation networks, comprise millions of individual elements (human, software and hardware) whose actions may be inconsequential in isolation but profoundly important in aggregate.

NM-CSforAll?s primary targets middle and high school STEM teachers, preparing them to be future CS teachers. It offers a novel, interdisciplinary approach that uses modeling and simulation as the basis for teaching CS Principles, the proposed, new Advanced Placement (AP) CS course. Teachers first take the modeling and simulation version of CS Principles and then implement it as a dual credit course for their students. During a Spring semester-long course, the teachers investigate real-world problems, view them through the lens of complex systems--SFI's primary research area--and then model and analyze them using agent-based modeling techniques. The project uses a \"flipped\" classroom methodology, meaning the lecture portion of the course will be offered as online videos, while the exercise and project work will take place in the lab, face-to-face. A Summer workshop focuses on reviewing the CS content of the course, learning pedagogy, and recruitment techniques in preparation for the Fall semester implementation in the schools. The Fall implementation of the dual credit CS Principles class for high school students uses the videos developed for the teacher professional development course as lecture material and weekly \"lab\" session meetings led by participating teachers acting as learning coaches. (NM now requires a dual-credit, AP, or honors course for high school graduation and this course will fulfill the requirement.) NM CSforAll's secondary strategy fosters teachers' CS content learning, CS teaching pedagogy, and computer programming practice through engagement in a professional online community. NM-CSforAll's online network will include video sharing, uploading of documentation of work sessions, and social networking capabilities providing opportunities for teachers to learn from each other?s implementations of CS activities and communicate with each other, STEM educators, CS professionals and educational researchers. Teacher participants, as the co-creators of content for the site, will have shared authority, a critical factor in creating environments conducive to building knowledge about teaching and learning CS. The project evaluation will determine whether teacher professional development in CS that integrates computational modeling and analysis of complex systems, builds capacity in future CS teachers, and whether co-creation and use of an online professional development network can improve teachers' pedagogical skills and sustain their interest in CS.","title":"CS 10K: New Mexico Computer Science for All (NM CSforAll)","awardID":"1240992","effectiveDate":"2012-11-01","expirationDate":"2015-10-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7361","name":"EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7382","name":"Computing Ed for 21st Century"}},{"dir":{"id":"11","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR EDUCATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES","abbr":"EHR"},"div":{"id":"1108","name":"Division of EXPER PROG TO STIM COMP RSCH","abbr":"EPS"},"pgm":{"id":"9150","name":"EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES"}}],"PIcoPI":["535543"],"PO":["561855"]},"197804":{"abstract":"This project, CC-NIE Network Infrastructure: High Performance Research Networking (HiPerNet), establishes a Science DMZ at the University of Chicago that is distinct from the general-purpose campus network and that is purpose-built for data-intensive science.

Recently, there has been increased interest in exploiting physical layer dynamics to generate keys. However, existing schemes exploit only the channel dynamics in the point-to-point channel or basic small wireless systems, but not other rich dynamics inherent to multiuser wireless networks. Furthermore, current studies focus mainly on the pairwise key agreement problem, and did not address issues arising from user interactions in networks. This project develops practical key generation schemes for large scale networks, which 1) fully exploit rich opportunities inherent to network dynamics, and 2) properly address issues arising from interaction among multiple users in networks. Topics including unicast and\/or multicast key generation, oblivious relay-assisted key generation, and secret sharing among multiple users are investigated. The goal of this project is to design transmission protocols and algorithms that have engineering impact and practical feasibility. Furthermore, these protocols and algorithms are implemented and tested on a testbed. This project also has strong education components.
