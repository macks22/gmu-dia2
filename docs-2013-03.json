{"199111":{"abstract":"Timing violations, an artifact of rapid technology scaling, embody a central reliability challenge in microprocessor design. A vast body of existing techniques in the landscape of timing violations fall under two broad categories: reactive and proactive. In both of these schemes, the lack of sufficient time in identifying an upcoming timing violation limits the scope of corrective techniques, incurring a large recovery overhead, or loss in fault coverage, respectively. Using a cross-layer analysis combining information from the application, architecture and circuit layers, this CAREER project demonstrates that timing violations can be predicted several clock cycles early. Early prediction of timing violations can offer a vast leverage in robust system design, opening up a promising direction for future systems research. In this paradigm, microprocessors can operate at a tighter frequency, where predictable errors frequently occur and are tolerated with minimal performance loss. Such a system design style can reshape physical design algorithms, boosting the energy efficient frontiers for microprocessor components. <br\/><br\/><br\/>Research in the nascent area of cross-layer design will enable circuit designers and system architects to increase collaborative design, and develop affordable, energy efficient and reliable computer systems. The rapid growth and evolution of integrated circuits creates a huge demand of Computer Engineering skill sets for addressing upcoming challenges. The CAREER project seeks to create a stream of future engineers capable of tackling growing unreliability in integrated circuits through focused knowledge dissemination.

Residential energy and water consumption is one of the largest and least understood areas of consumption and is responsible for 28% of US energy consumption and 56% of US drinking water consumption. Strategies for addressing our energy and water crisis clearly require a multifaceted approach that transcends technology. However, for developing a more complete understanding of energy consumption in the home, computing technology plays a critical role in the collection, analysis, and presentation of data to answer important sustainability questions by the scientific community. Past work has demonstrated sustained energy savings of 10-15% in the home with the appropriate feedback of appliance-level usage data, but required complex sensor installations. A great challenge still remains in practically deploying sensing technologies to gather this relevant data at a large scale.<br\/>Current sensing methods remain in their infancy and are limited to small, isolated deployments, and many existing sensing approaches tend to be deemed obtrusive and difficult to install. In addition, no comprehensive public dataset on energy and water use and raw sensor data exists for researchers to build and compare new analytic tools and methods, thus limiting the ability to participate in this kind of work to a small number of groups who have access to this proprietary information through their own small deployments. The goal of this multi-year research project is to democratize sensing for sustainability by developing a complete electricity and water sensing and analytics platform for homes.<br\/>Intellectual Merit: This research will make progress on two grand challenges posed by the scientific community: 1) accelerated deployment of ubiquitous computing technology for improving quality of life and 2) the reduction of residential energy and water consumption. <br\/>This work involves novel approaches to sensing electricity and water use in the home using a small number of sensors. This includes the first full exploration of practical water sensing and analytic techniques that provide highly granular information on water use and combining electricity and water sensor streams for improved classification. This research focuses on the design, development, and evaluation (both hardware and software) of new, easy-to-install, and cost-effective sensing solutions. The insights and artifacts resulting from this research have merit in other applications beyond sustainability, such as elder care, in-home rehabilitation, and chronic disease management.<br\/>Broader Impact: The platform proposed in this research has direct implications for the growing focus on the energy and sustainability by both the federal and local governments. The potential ease of deployment for the proposed technology will make this a desirable technology for environmental researchers and ultimately homeowners who currently have little insight into their actual energy and water use. The comprehensive energy and water dataset collected with this research will serve as an enabler for others in this space to create their own analytic approaches. More generally, this data will enable scientists, engineers, and industry to answer foundational questions regarding energy and water. <br\/>The potential for the broad impact of this research coupled with the inherent interdisciplinary nature of ubiquitous computing integrates with an education plan designed to excite high school students and undergraduates to pursue careers in computing and engineering in general. They will learn about interdisciplinary research opportunities and engage in activities by participating in the primary investigator?s research lab around ?sustainable thinking.? New graduate-level courses will be designed to educate young researchers about relevant research topics in ubiquitous computing and learn new advanced prototyping techniques necessary for building real-world applications.

The complexities can originate from the physical signals of interest in a sensing system or from non-ideal device and algorithmic behaviors within the electronics itself, which are becoming unavoidable due to technology and system scaling. As an example, this study focuses on analyzing physiological signals that are available through low-power medical sensors. Though such signals are highly indicative, extracting medical information of value requires high-order models of the underlying physiological processes when in fact no tractable analytical models generally exist. This study also focuses on errors within the hardware that occur due to unpredictable but inevitable technological defects and variations, leading to high levels of errors in the data being processed. These challenges are approached through algorithmic methods emerging from the domain of machine learning that construct models for interpreting data from the data itself. The large amount of data that is available through small-scale sensors can thus be leveraged as an extensive knowledgebase; but the problem is that these methods are not well supported by low-power electronics, in terms of their computational energy, memory requirements, network interactions, etc. This research starts with the kernel computations used in machine-learning frameworks, and it investigates kernel formulations, structured hardware architectures, and algorithms to overcome the physical complexities associated with application signals and technological non-idealities. The principles are studied through hardware and software experimental demonstrations.<br\/><br\/>The broader impact of this research is to enable greater value of electronic systems in critical applications and to establish an interdisciplinary educational program that teaches students to connect fundamentals from computer science, low-power electronics, and clinical applications. While electronics presents tremendous capabilities, its impact on real-world challenges such as in healthcare depends on high-value interactions with physical systems. This program emphasizes clinical applications and collaborations to understand the role that electronics can play in enabling preemptive medical harm detection and chronic-disease management over large patient populations: something that is infeasible with today's methods. This program also emphasizes interactions with the semiconductor industry, to transfer principles and architectures both for advanced sensing platforms and for algorithmic approaches to hardware resilience; with hardware errors having been identified by the industry as one of the critical challenges, methods that overcome the need for traditional forms of design margining are being urgently pursued. New interdisciplinary courses, student projects, and outreach activities will expose students to external collaborators and will drive an educational program that ties together engineering fundamentals from multiple domains through an application-driven pursuit of systems to overcome critical challenges in healthcare decision support.","title":"CAREER: Hardware and Algorithmic Architectures for Analyzing Physically-complex Systems: embedding inference capabilities in ultra-low-power sensors","awardID":"1253670","effectiveDate":"2013-03-01","expirationDate":"2018-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7936","name":"SIGNAL PROCESSING"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7945","name":"DES AUTO FOR MICRO & NANO SYST"}}],"PIcoPI":[534384],"PO":["562984"]},"199598":{"abstract":"Building a Unified Infrastructure for Data Integration on Political Violence and Conflict <br\/><br\/>This proposal s a conceptualization project whereby leaders of several major data collections, along with experts in insurgency, ethnic conflict, terrorism, computer science, and data management, will build consensus around a unified infrastructure for political violence data collection and integration. The project will create a scalable ontology focused on four domains relevant to all forms of political violence: conflicts, actors, geographies, and events. This ontological infrastructure will allow researchers and policy makers who study political violence, including its etiology and consequences, to access and integrate existing data from the major political violence data collections currently collected at academic institutions and non-governmental organizations around the world. This infrastructure will also facilitate the development of new non-linear and semantic analytical methods to decipher the complex dynamics of conflict and violence. Finally, this infrastructure will provide a platform for the next generation of data collection on violence and conflict by creating a flexible framework for new data collection projects that is both easily exchangeable and adheres to the consensus-based ontologies developed. The proposed project incorporates a two-day stakeholder workshop, a schematic design of the ontological infrastructure for political violence data collection, and a web-based community-moderated issue-tracking wiki to encourage participatory development and refinement of the ontologies. Additionally, the proposed project supports one of the core missions of NSF?s Big Data initiative, focusing on the development of a data infrastructure relevant to national security. Intellectual Merit: Although scientists have made major advances in the empirical understanding of political violence in recent years, nonetheless further advances are being hindered by the fact that leading projects from around the world are largely autonomous and uncoordinated. This project will address this weakness by creating a scalable ontology focused on domains critical to political violence. The major goal of this enterprise is to design a strategy for integrating the world?s most important data bases on political violence within an expandable platform that will allow not only updating original data but the addition of new data and variables, including rapidly evolving data sets derived from the social media. The proposal has built in sufficient resources to host a two-day stakeholder conference, to prepare read-ahead materials for stakeholders before the conference, to design and staff a wiki for reaching out to the research community and for developing a final report that will serve as a springboard for a proposal to implement the ontology designed. By integrating the major data bases, providing an infrastructure for growth, and making the end product available to the world?s research community, the proposed activity could have a transformative impact on the science of political violence. Broader Impacts: This ontological approach to political violence data collection will offer critical insights for data integration and for advancing the scientific study of violent conflict. Effective identification of ontologies across major political violence data collections will provide an essential roadmap for the integration of these data structures and the development of new applications and analysis for research on national security. Additionally, the workshop will serve to network senior and junior faculty alongside graduate students thereby developing a new generation of political violence experts. The translation of the workshop report into a community-moderated and web-based issue-tracking wiki will serve to expand participation to include other researchers who will be instrumental in defining and shaping a larger ontological structure for both existing and future data collection efforts.","title":"CIF21: DIBBs: Building a Unified Infrastructure for Data Integration on Political Violence and Conflict","awardID":"1255793","effectiveDate":"2013-03-01","expirationDate":"2014-05-31","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7726","name":"DATANET"}}],"PIcoPI":["562455",535155],"PO":["565292"]},"199246":{"abstract":"Heterogeneous three-dimensional (3D) integration is an emerging paradigm for developing multifunctional systems at a lower cost. The dominant practice targets primarily high performance applications with limited heterogeneity such as logic-on-logic and memory-on-logic integration. On the contrary, this proposal embodies a significantly different vision, in which the focus is on low power highly heterogeneous 3D systems-on-chip (SoCs) with promising applications to the life sciences, energy efficient mobile computing, and environmental control. Despite the recent and growing efforts to develop hybrid 3D ICs, a systematic design and analysis framework does not yet exist. This research fills this need by addressing three interrelated issues of critical importance to this framework: system-wide power, signal, and sensing integrity. Simultaneously satisfying these three design objectives is a significant challenge in tightly coupled 3D SoCs. By considering multiple planes as a single entity, novel circuit- and physical-level design and analysis methodologies will be developed to alleviate this fundamental challenge. The traditional understanding of signal integrity will be extended to consider sensing integrity, an important issue in heterogeneous 3D SoCs, where multiple sensors and sensing electronics are coordinated. The proposed methodologies will be evaluated by developing and fabricating a heterogeneous 3D test chip with application to bio-electronics.<br\/><br\/><br\/>The synergy between 3D integration and heterogeneous SoCs provides a paradigm changing vision for integrated electronics with substantial benefits to science, industry, and society at large.

Emotional understanding is a crucial skill in human communication. For this reason, modeling and recognizing emotions is essential in the design and implementation of interfaces that are more in tune with the user's needs. Starting from the premise that paralinguistic information is non-uniformly conveyed across time, this study aims to identify emotionally prominent regions or focal points across various acoustic features. The study explores a novel approach based on synthetic speech to build reference models characterizing patterns observed in neutral speech. These reference models are used to contrast the emotional information observed in localized segments of a speech signal. The study builds a synthetic speech signal that conveys the same lexical information and is timely aligned with the target sentence in the database. Since it is expected that a single synthetic speech will not capture the full range of variability observed in neutral speech, the study explores approaches to produce different neutral synthetic realizations. After creating a parallel corpus with time-aligned synthetic speech, the study explores how well synthetic speech captures the acoustic patterns and emotional percepts of neutral, nonemotional speech. Then, a target signal from the database is compared with the properties observed across the family of synthesized signals. <br\/><br\/>The study presents a novel approach to build a robust emotion recognition system that exploits the underlying nonuniform externalization process of expressive behaviors. Algorithms that able to identify localized emotional segments have the potential to shift the current approaches used in the area of affective computing. Instead of recognizing the emotional content of pre-segmented sentences, the problem is formulated as a detection paradigm, which is appealing from an application perspective. These advances represent a transformative breakthrough in the area of behavioral analysis and affective computing. The proposed models and algorithms provide numerous insights to explore and extend theories in linguistic and paralinguistic human behavior. Having established the base infrastructure for this exploratory research, several new scientific avenues will emerge that serve as truly innovative advancements that will impact applications in security and defense, next generation of advanced user interfaces, health informatics, and education.

In response, the PI is developing technologies that, given knowledge of a virtual scene, a specific rendering task, and parallel hardware platform, can automatically generate an optimized graphics system implementation specialized for this context. The core idea is to develop unifying representations for the large space of algorithmic approaches to key rendering problems such as surface visibility and shading and then to leverage these representations in new intelligent renderer compilation systems that identity efficient algorithms for a given workload and machine context. In this system, selecting appropriate algorithms is as much a part of the renderer compilation process as synthesis of high performance code.

New technologies allow us to determine the genomes of organisms co-existing within various ecosystems ranging from ocean, soil and human-body. Several researchers have embarked on studying the pathogenic role played by the microbiome, defined as the collection of microbial organisms within the human body, with respect to human health and disease conditions. <br\/><br\/>The research activities in this CAREER project will develop approaches for the identification of taxonomy, function and metabolic potential from the collective genomes samples. A key contribution will be the development of multi-task learning approaches that combine information across multiple hierarchical databases associated with the annotation problems. During research, the PI will investigate the best ways to capture the underlying hierarchical structure, prevalent within different annotation databases. The rationale underlying this proposed research is that there is a wealth of complementary information that exists across several manually curated biological databases. Associating microbiome with phenotype requires integration of various high-throughput omic data sources (genomic, metabolic, proteomic) that may not be uniformly available across all samples. The PI will develop data fusion classifiers within the multi-task learning paradigm to integrate heterogeneous, incomplete data sources for predicting phenotypes. This project will lead to the following key contributions: (i) Improved metagenome annotation models by integration of multiple prediction tasks and associated databases. (ii) Incorporation of hierarchical information within regularized multi-task learning. (iii) Integration of diverse and incomplete information sources. (iv) Scalable algorithms that use hash based feature representations and improve the learning rates.<br\/><br\/>This project is interdisciplinary and spans the fields of machine learning, bioinformatics, metagenomics, microbiology and environmental ecology. This project will foster the the synergy between teaching and research by providing an environment for all students to develop intellectually and professionally. The project integrates the research with an education plan focused on mentoring of high school, undergraduate and graduate students, curriculum development and laboratory visits. Planned activities include training of inter-disciplinary researchers, integration of microbiome analysis related projects within the classes, curriculum enhancement and implementation of new learning strategies.

Clusters and graphs provide a meaningful representation of the structure of information contained in data, e.g. in neuroscience and health care domains, clustering patients with similar phenotypes and genotypes helps identify target groups for drug design, clustering fiber tracks generated by high-resolution Digital Surface Imaging (DSI) scans of brains help identify significant neural pathways, and graph structures can reflect connectivity between brain regions. The results of this work will significantly enhance the ability to exploit such modern datasets through new methods for learning clusters and graphs from data that is large-scale, high-dimensional, under-sampled, corrupted, and often only available in a compressed or streaming representation. <br\/><br\/>Specifically, this project will develop computationally efficient and principled methods for learning clusters and graphs that can (i) perform unsupervised feature selection to discard irrelevant features in high dimensions, (ii) leverage feedback based on intelligent adaptive queries that focus resources on most informative variables and features, (iii) use compressive measurement design that adapts to the information structure for measurement and computation efficiency, and (iv) be able to handle noisy streaming data. The algorithms will be accompanied with performance guarantees in the form of a precise characterization of the mis-clustering rate and graph recovery error. Additionally, the project will investigate the tradeoffs between number of measurements, computational complexity and robustness in these problems. The methods and theory developed will be evaluated through simulations as well as their applicability to real datasets in neuroscience and healthcare domain, in collaboration with practitioners from these fields. <br\/><br\/>The results of this research could potentially transform many application domains that involve grouping similar variables and learning complex interactions between them, based on big and dirty datasets. In particular, the neuroscience and healthcare applications are likely have very direct and significant implications for society. Accurately mapping neural pathways will help diagnose and treat brain pathologies at an early stage, and help understand brain functioning. Clustering patients and discovering disease spreading pathways based on few measurements of relevant genetic features or indicators could help prevent and cure diseases, and also minimize healthcare costs.

In particular, the work plan includes collecting gaze data in real-world conditions in the context of using the existing Reading Tutor, designing software to display those traces so that accuracy can be guauged, testing gazepoint accuracy and detecting gaze-speech discrepancies, and using that data to develop heuristics for detecting tracking errors in real time and calibrating eye tracking data to noisy school environments, a primary environment where the augmented Reading Tutor would ultimately be used.

Given a pool of entities (e.g., movies, books, experts) and an objective function such systems have to identify a collection (i.e., a subset) of entities from the pool that optimizes the objective function. For example, in movie-recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix) the goal is to identify subsets of movies to recommend to registered users. Analogous problems arise in social networks and social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook), where advertisers need to identify a small set of targets for their advertisements. Finally, project management teams in large organizations often use expertise management systems to identify the subset of experts needed to complete a specific project.<br\/><br\/>Current Recommender Systems suffer from severe limitations in settings where (i) the users multiple interactions with the system over time and the recommendations provided to a specific user at any given time need to take into account the past recommendations given to the same user or (ii) The entities that make up the recommended collections are rational entities, e.g., participants in a social network, or members of a project team, that have their own goals and preferences that influence their behavior as members of the collection. This project aims to address these two shortcomings of current Recommender Systems by designing, implementing, and evaluating combinatorial algorithms for identifying (a) sequences of collections, rather than a single collection and (b) collections of rational entities with individual goals, preferences, or objectives.<br\/><br\/>In addition to developing a suite of novel combinatorial algorithms and heuristics for recommending sequences of collections and collections of rational entities, the project aims to develop and deploy two application-specific testbeds: (i) a personalized meal planner provides to its users weekly meal recommendations to guide them towards healthy eating choices; and (ii) A crowdsourcing platform with support for virtual team formation to allow students registered in some of the courses at Boston University, to form teams online to collaborate on class projects (when appropriate). <br\/><br\/>Broader impacts of this research include: new models and methods that signficantly advance the current state of the art in Recommender Systems, with broad applications in a number of domains including social networks (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.), online recommendation systems (e.g., Amazon, Netflix, etc.), and daily-deal sites (e.g., Groupon, LivingSocial, etc.).

This reduces the benefits of crowdsourcing for both current adopters and a wider community of potential beneficiaries. Although diverse communities have developed statistical algorithms for quality assurance, the splintered nature of these communities has led to relatively little comparative benchmarking and\/or integration of alternative techniques. Dearth of reference implementations and shared datasets has further abated progress, as have evaluations based on tightly-coupled systems, domain specific tasks, and synthetic data. This project investigates, integrates, and rigorously benchmarks diverse quality assurance algorithms across a range of tasks, data scales, and operational settings. Overall, technical findings are expected to transform current understanding of quality assurance methods for crowdsourcing, including identifying key limitations of the current state-of-the-art in order to focus ongoing research and innovation where it can have the greatest impact. Reference implementations of key algorithms are designed to support reuse, reproducible findings, continual benchmarking, and ongoing progress.

Assumptions that crowdsourcing workers are unreliable or interchangeable limit the complexity and scope of work which can be successfully accomplished with online crowdsourcing.

By developing effective methods to measure work quality over time and identify trusted workers, it will be possible to differentiate, recognize, and reward quality work to promote merit-based economic mobility.

Among the several challenges one faces when designing estimators for MAV teams, the most important one is the stringent resource limitations of MAVs. While in any engineered system the resources are inevitably finite, cost, power, and weight considerations make the limitations particularly strict for teams of small MAVs. In this work, we will develop a rigorous, optimization-based framework for the design of estimation and inference algorithms, as well as for the design of the MAV platforms themselves. Our approach will yield distributed estimators capable of optimally allocating the sensing, processing, communication, and energy resources of an MAV team.

It has also offered the (as yet unrealized) promise of running multiple data formats. However, when two lambdas of the same wavelength need to be inserted onto the same optical fiber at least one of them must undergo OEO in order to change its wavelength.

This question is expected to lead to graph properties that minimize the need for wavelength interchange in physical networks.

Recent advancements in multi-antenna wireless systems have allowed wireless nodes to use either all of their antennas for transmission (or reception), or to use half of them for transmission and the other half for reception. The first system is called a MIMO system and the latter is called a full duplex system. Traditionally, MIMO and full duplex have been seen as competing technologies. This research shows that they can be combined in innovative ways to fundamentally increase the capacity of a wireless link compared to the case when they operate separately. This combination allows a node to dynamically allocate radio resources for transmission and reception. It further shows that informing routing and scheduling protocols about this flexible radio resource feature can significantly improve network capacity. The research proposes innovations in the hardware, protocols and software needed in the current wireless network architecture to achieve significant network-wide capacity increases. Thus, this research will produce highly flexible radios that will combine full duplex and MIMO. This flexibility will allow future wireless nodes to dynamically allocate radio resources for simultaneous transmissions and receptions. Second, it will develop MAC and network layer protocols that can fully reap the benefits of this flexible system.

However, both individual innovation and the formation of rich collaborations still rely on traditional research and social mechanisms. While virtual organizations help with access to data environments among groups, members must still proactively seek to collaborate. The difficulty of sharing analysis tools, and the lack of understanding of how such tools are used, create friction that impedes extracting the greatest benefit from data and its usage. If the scientific community can formalize collection of User Data Interaction (UDI) data and develop actionable characteristic behavior patterns from it, the friction can be relieved and scientists can be connected in behaviorally meaningful ways that are not currently imagined. In this proposal is discussed the opportunity for working on the problem. Data is the lifeblood of science. Recent funding opportunities have fueled support for uploading, archiving, and managing data in more formal and standard ways. However, the actual use of data through data exploration tools is still a highly variable process. Interactive data exploration tools provide the opportunity to record researcher interactions during the exploration process. The pattern of interactions such users undertake while searching, exploring, and using data is a largely unexploited opportunity for new connections and new learning that could help researchers identify useful exploration modes or gaps, and even new collaborative partners that could increase interactions and innovation. Such data about how users explore data are here termed, ?User-Data Interaction (UDI) Data.? Creating cyberinfrastructure building blocks to support a standard for collecting UDI Data, community development of data exploration tools, and the exploration of UDI data could fundamentally change the practice of science and engineering. Having such data and analysis tools hosted within a shared cyberinfrastructure could also allow for unprecedented study of their use and effectiveness.<br\/>The goal of this conceptualization research will be to define an implementation project for the DIBBs program. To achieve this goal, the approach will be to understand the kinds of data analysis tools that various user communities currently use, those that they would like to create and share, and to explore the ensuing UDI data that could be collected and leveraged. A data source will be characterized as any service into which a user can specify a query and receive a semi-structured result. By way of example, this may include an online database with which users interact through forms, a graphical interface to a data cube, or even an online simulation tool. The proposing team has access to three such toolkits in use by thousands of users today (Rappture Toolkit, iKNEER, and DataView) to study as sources of analysis tools and UDI data. Specifically, access to the developers of these systems will provide information about how such systems could generate UDI data and what its important features may be. Having built an understanding from active communities and small group discussions, the final step of information gathering will be two larger discussions held in conjunction with two events: HUBbub 2013 and an NSF S2I2 conceptualization project meeting. The Intellectual Merit: This research will identify the social and technological roadblocks to sharing data analysis tools, and the transformational potential of UDI data. The intellectual merit of this activity will be an evidence-based blueprint for a cyberinfrastructure environment that will automatically gather UDI data, develop patterns from those data, and facilitate amplified discovery and collaboration based on those patterns in a way that acceptably balances efficacy and privacy. Collaborations will increase and will be of greater substance. Broader Impacts: This work will pave the way for new scientific connections among researchers, educators, and students that will accelerate research and innovation. The difficulties that underrepresented groups inherently face in traditional methods of establishing scientific collaborations will be bridged by an implementation of the proposed work, allowing everyone to connect to tools and other researchers?not solely by established reputation, but based on their interactions with data. Because the work is not specific to one virtual organization or data tool, it will have a broad reach across diverse scientific communities that use data and data analysis tools.","title":"CIF21 DIBBs: Conceptualization of the Social and Innovation Opportunities of Data Analysis","awardID":"1255781","effectiveDate":"2013-03-15","expirationDate":"2014-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7726","name":"DATANET"}}],"PIcoPI":[535138,535139,535140,535141],"PO":["565292"]},"199242":{"abstract":"Over the past several decades, computer system performance has grown exponentially, enabling progress on key problems in science, engineering, health, and other areas. Owing to power, heat, and wire length limitations, however, microprocessors are now adding more, instead of faster, cores with each successive generation. As a result, general-purpose software must become more concurrent to see continued performance gains. Unfortunately, writing and debugging shared-memory concurrent software is notoriously difficult. A key problem is that most shared-memory programming languages and software systems do not provide good support for correct concurrent execution. They lack such support because all known approaches are impractical. This project aims to provide practical support for concurrency correctness in commodity systems. It develops low-overhead, software-only approaches that execute on existing commodity hardware. These approaches help programmers write and debug more reliable, scalable software, and to make software more reliable automatically by eliminating whole classes of errors. These benefits have the potential to enable society to continue to rely on software systems for increasingly complex, critical tasks. Furthermore, the project includes educational and outreach activities that help educate students in concurrent software systems, enhance dissemination of the ideas and outcomes, and broaden participation in computer science.<br\/><br\/>The project develops practical, always-on dynamic checking and enforcement of key concurrency correctness properties: atomicity, sequential consistency, and multithreaded determinism. Existing approaches are impractical because custom hardware-based approaches are unrealistic, and software-based approaches slow programs unacceptably. The project builds on preliminary work on an efficient concurrency control mechanism that elides expensive synchronization from non-conflicting accesses, which are the vast majority of accesses. Developing new analyses and systems presents significant new challenges, both to apply the novel concurrency control mechanism and to make other aspects of these analyses and systems efficient enough for production systems. For example, precise conflict detection must track prior accesses and contend with imprecision inherent to the concurrency control mechanism. The project aims to make the analyses and systems both practical and flexible, which requires systematically investigating how to reduce the costs of conflicting and non-conflicting accesses. Expected contributions are the first practical always-on atomicity checker, the first practical multithreaded record & replay system, the first practical sequential consistency checker, and the first practical system providing multithreaded system determinism. In addition to broader impacts, the contributions have the potential to enable new research on efficient software-based analyses and systems that support concurrency correctness.","title":"CAREER: Practical Language and System Support for Reliable Concurrent Software","awardID":"1253703","effectiveDate":"2013-03-01","expirationDate":"2018-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"7943","name":"PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":[534400],"PO":["564588"]},"199275":{"abstract":"This project investigates the problem of scheduling the processing of collections of streams of medical sensor data, with a goal of providing high-confidence per-packet service guarantees that are robust to variability in the stream generation and concomitant changes in the loads at the distributed set of resources where streams are processed. Given the NP-Hard complexity of optimal stream scheduling and the need to handle streams that are stochastic in nature, the service guarantees are probabilistic. The approach makes use of statistical and machine learning techniques, harnessing a mix of application-independent and application-dependent features to adaptively orchestrate stream processing over a collection of resources with dynamic utilization profiles while retaining the ability to prioritize processing under heavy load, for multiple concurrent applications. Data from clinical and assisted living settings are used to evaluate the efficacy of solutions.<br\/><br\/>Health care and homeland security can benefit from this research, as well as experimental science. Skyrocketing healthcare costs have coincided with the proliferation of electronic monitoring devices in medical and assisted living environments, which generate data streams of patient data. Timely monitoring and analysis of these streams can detect emergencies early and improve patient outcomes, but failure can be fatal. Improvements in the efficiency and robustness of automated medical data stream processing translate to lower costs and improved outcomes. There are analogous opportunities in homeland security, where chemical and biological sensor data must be processed in real-time for threat evaluation. Open-source software produced as part of this research, which can be configured over an arbitrary number of machines to process a large number of streams in a variety of settings, lowers entry barriers for scientists who need to process observational data in their applications. The project will also provide educational opportunities for students, and middle school outreach activities targeted at improving assimilation of mathematical concepts among Native American students.","title":"CAREER: Robust Processing of Data Streams in Real Time","awardID":"1253908","effectiveDate":"2013-03-01","expirationDate":"2018-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7354","name":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS"}}],"PIcoPI":[534466],"PO":["564778"]}}
