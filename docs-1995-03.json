{"1276":{"abstract":"9504288 Mairson The goal of this research is to investigate the computational resources required to implement correct, optimal evaluation mechanisms for the lambda calculus. Because lambda calculus is a foundation for the design and implementation of programming languages, such research could contribute to the understanding of programming language implementation. Moreover, it would integrate approaches to computation that emphasize semantic issues as well as those of computational complexity. The solution to optimality proposed by Gonthier, Abadi, and L vy will be analyzed. The computational correctness of this scheme in an elementary, first-principles sense will be established and its computational complexity will be analyzed. Ultimately, a version of a correct evaluator whose complexity is polynomial in a reasonable cost model for lambda calculus will be put forward that the lambda calculus may be regarded as a \"first class\" formalism in the sense of the invariance thesis, the computationally efficient version of the Church-Turing thesis. The static semantics as a possible foundation for a lazy environment model will also be investigated. ***","title":"CISE Postdoctoral Program: Computational Efficiency of Optimal Reduction in Lambda Calculus","awardID":"9504288","effectiveDate":"1995-03-15","expirationDate":"1998-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["370683"],"PO":["564412"]},"1189":{"abstract":"9503996 Brown In this project the effort will be concentrated on (1) building an active vision system that uses PUMA or SARCOS manipulators to control the camera's position, and (2) using and extending existing techniques for recovering shape from images of a curved object's occluding contour. Because the camera moves around the object in a continuous fashion, camera position control and model-building will be modeled as two continuous, interdependent processes that occur simultaneously and operate in real-time. The work on camera position control will focus on controlling the camera's position in real-time, and on imposing as few camera and manipulator calibration requirements as possible. The work on model-building will focus on developing real-time curve tracking methods that can handle the connectivity changes of occluding contour curves, and on implementing and evaluating existing shape-from-contour techniques.

Firstly, the combination give rise to a number of unique optimization problems that are not germane to any one of the paradigms alone. Secondly, an efficient compilation system must integrate a suite of optimizations so as to extensively share ideas, formulations and implementation efforts. Some of the interesting optimization problems relevant to XSB will be identified and some preliminary ideas for their solution will be sketched. A promising and powerful idea to integrate these optimizations through the use of constraints will be outlined.

This is related to the complexity of the model the learner is using to fit the data and generalize to unseen data. Implications for model selection and data mining will be explored. Second, it is proposed to develop active algorithms which choose their own examples. This reduces the sample complexity of learning at the cost of an increased computational burden. Access to high performance computing will help greatly. Applications to function approximation, pattern classification and system identification will be explored. Finally, the tools developed earlier will be applied to the domain of natural languages. In particular, the sample complexity of learning grammar will be investigated.

Type theory has proved to be an important organizing principle in programming language design. This is well exemplified by the use of type theory in the design of modularity and abstraction constructs. This investigation seeks to consolidate advances in type theory into the design of the ML2000 programming language. Type theory has proved important for the implementation of programming languages. Conventional syntax-directed compilation methods are generalized to type-directed compilation, allowing type information to be exploited during compilation. Sophisticated type systems such as those derived from the Girard- Reynolds polymorphic lambda-calculus suggest new implementation strategies based on passing type information at link- and run- time. This research investigates the use of type-based compilation techniques. Operational semantics provides a suitable framework for addressing issues of compiler correctness and proving properties of programs. Typed programming languages such as Standard ML provide a rich setting in which to discuss high-level programming techniques such as data abstraction, modularity, and separate compilation. Types are essential for reasoning about programs. A procedure can in general be deemed to have certain input\/output properties only under the assumption that its arguments have suitable types. Operational semantics is a useful pedagogical tool for teaching undergraduate programming, both as an explanatory device and as the basis for proving properties of programs and languages. Important advantages are expected through the interplay between research and education.","title":"Career: Type Theory and Operational Semantics for Programming Languages","awardID":"9502674","effectiveDate":"1995-03-01","expirationDate":"1998-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0501","name":"Division of COMPUTER & COMMUNICATION FOUND","abbr":"CCF"},"pgm":{"id":"2880","name":"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU"}}],"PIcoPI":["485877"],"PO":["150697"]},"732":{"abstract":"In this project, a fast simulation environment to aid code generation for pipelined and superscalar machine will be developed.

These algorithms and tools are difficult to predict due to the non-normal distribution of the noise and the presence of outliers, as well as the nonstationarity of both noise and signals. They thus make excellent benchmark problems for robust nonlinear modeling techniques. In robust models, robust error measures for gracefully handling outliers in the data will be incorporated. Also, a new method for automatically regularizing (constraining) the ANN model during training by using second order statistics of the cost function gradient. This prevents the network from adapting to noise and thus produces robust models. In the area of learning algorithms, the application of a new simulated annealing type learning algorithm to recurrent networks will be investigated. It is believed that, based upon past experience with feedforward networks with many hidden layers, this algorithm will improve the performance of recurrent networks. In variable selection, a novel use of genetic algorithms (GA) in combination with ANN models to select optimal subsets of variables for solving a problem will be pursued. Combining GAs with a newly developed statistical test, the so-called delta-test, into a more powerful tool for determining the optimal variable subset will also be done. ***","title":"CISE Postdoctoral Program: Robust Forecasting with Neural Networks","awardID":"9503968","effectiveDate":"1995-03-15","expirationDate":"1997-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"2885","name":"CISE RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE"}}],"PIcoPI":["234597"],"PO":["173164"]},"635":{"abstract":"The focus of this CAREER research proposal is the design, semantics, and implementation of ATDCC, a language for a network of asynchronously communicating reactive programs.

An optimal algorithm for k servers has already been developed: the algorithm is 2-competitive for two servers. A closed form function, which is a good candidate for the potential function for k = 3, is examined. A second goal is to attack a number of other on-line problems for which optimal competitiveness is unknown, including: randomized list update, multi-processor scheduling, and page migration; and to develop a general theory of on-line problem solutions. A third goal is to show how the techniques, developed for the solution of the k-server problem, can be applied to other on-line problems.
