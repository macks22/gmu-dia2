For over a decade, ISMAR (and its forerunner events IWAR\/ISAR and ISMR) has been the premier international conference on research into the science, technology, applications and uses of Mixed Reality (MR) and Augmented Reality (AR). The proliferation of powerful mobile hardware has opened up new avenues of research into MR and AR while enabling corporate and consumer applications on a wide scale. Across this spectrum fascinating new types of user interfaces, technologies, and concepts are beginning to emerge. The field is highly interdisciplinary in nature, bringing together technologists, educators, humanists, artists and social scientists, among others. ISMAR is one of the largest meetings devoted to the advancement of mixed reality, augmented reality, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction with the physical world, and encourages six different submission types: Papers and Posters, Workshops, Panels, Tutorials, Demonstrations and Contests. Because of the diverse fields relevant to mixed and augmented reality, ISMAR content is organized in two tracks: The Science & Technology (S&T) program and The Arts, Media and Humanities (AMH) program. The top papers are often extended, reviewed, and submitted for publication in the prestigious IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics. More information about the conference may be found at http:\/\/ismar.vgtc.org\/. <br\/><br\/>This was the second Doctoral Consortium held in conjunction with an ISMAR symposium. A total of 7 graduate students participated in the workshop, along with senior members of the community (faculty and industry researchers) who served as mentors. The goal was to provide the students with an opportunity at a critical time in their careers to present their work to a group of mentors and peers from a diverse set of academic and industrial institutions, to receive feedback on their doctoral research plan and progress, and to build a cohort of young researchers within the ISMAR community. To these ends participants were asked to prepare both a technical presentation and a poster describing their work. A pre-event social dinner allowed the attendees (students, mentors and organizers) to get to know each other. The following day all attendees met for an informal breakfast at 8:00 AM, after which each student participant had 50 minutes devoted to his\/her research, beginning with a presentation for approximately 30 minutes followed by about 20 minutes reserved for an extensive discussion with the other graduate student participants and the senior researchers. The discussion was facilitated by the Doctoral Consortium co-chairs and mentors, with the goal of addressing the strengths and weaknesses of the research, challenges and issues, implications of the results, potential suggestions for additional approaches or follow-on work, and career guidance related to the student's work and area. The posters were on display during the ISMAR conference poster sessions (in which the students were expected to take part), and were marked as being part of the Doctoral Consortium. All results from the Doctoral Consortium, including the procedures followed, were archived in the ISMAR 2013 DC binder as a reference for next year's conference.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The organizers took steps proactively to achieve a diversity of research topics, disciplinary backgrounds, methodological approaches, and home institutions among the students, to ensure that they met people outside their own specific area. For example, a maximum of one graduate student per institution was selected. Factors such as gender and ethnicity were also taken into account, with an emphasis on including underrepresented groups. Due in part to the remote location of this year's conference, in the end most of the student participants were from foreign universities; funding for the international students was secured from other sources, with NSF funds being requested only to support the 2 students from U.S. institutions of higher learning.","title":"WORKSHOP: ISMAR 2013 Doctoral Consortium","awardID":"1417007","effectiveDate":"2013-12-15","expirationDate":"2014-11-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[565150],"PO":["565227"]},"210785":{"abstract":"This project funds travel support for academic participation in a workshop organized by the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Subcommittee's Large Scale Networking (LSN) Coordinating Group, and co-sponsored by NSF and DoE, on issues associated with the national deployment of an inter-carrier Software Defined Networking (SDN) service.

Sponsored by ACM, the annual IUI conferences represent the growing interest in next-generation intelligent and interactive user interfaces; they are the premier forum where researchers from academia and industry, who work at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), come together to exchange complementary insights and to present and discuss outstanding research and applications whose goal is to make the computerized world a more amenable place. Unlike traditional AI the focus is not so much on making the computer smart all by itself, but rather on making the interaction between computers and people smarter. Unlike traditional HCI, there is a focus on solutions that involve large amounts of knowledge and emerging technologies such as natural language understanding, brain computer interfaces, and gesture recognition. To this end, IUI encourages contributions not only from computer science but also from related fields such as psychology, cognitive science, computer graphics, the arts, etc. IUI 2014 will be the 17th conference in the series; topics of interest this year include: intelligent interactive interfaces, systems, and devices; ubiquitous interfaces; smart environments and tools; human-centered interfaces; mobile interfaces; multimodal interfaces; pen-based interfaces; spoken and natural language interfaces; conversational interfaces; affective and social interfaces; tangible interfaces; collaborative multi-user interfaces; adaptive interfaces; sensor-based interfaces; user modeling and interaction with novel interfaces and devices; interfaces for personalization and recommender systems; interfaces for plan-based systems; interfaces that incorporate knowledge- or agent-based approaches; help interfaces for complex tasks; example- and demonstration-based interfaces; interfaces for intelligent generation and presentation of information; intelligent authoring systems; synthesis of multimodal virtual characters and social robots; interfaces for games and entertainment; for learning-based interactions and for health informatics; empirical studies and evaluations of IUI interfaces; and new approaches to designing intelligent user interfaces. More information about the conference is available online at http:\/\/iuiconf.org\/. <br\/><br\/>The IUI 2014 Student Consortium will build on the success of the previous two such events. The heart of the Consortium will be a full-day workshop on February 24, immediately preceding the conference, and will be structured to give student trainees exposure to their new research community by giving a 20-30 presentation on their work and receiving feedback from peers and a panel of senior researchers. Group lunch and dinner will encourage social interaction among the student cohort and informal personal interaction with the mentors. The students' work will also be featured during the main conference in a poster session, where they will gain additional experience explaining their work to others in the field. The IUI conference organizers will pay for audio-visual services, two coffee breaks, and space for accommodating attendees in the student session; no funds are requested for these items from NSF.<br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: This funding will enable attendance at the IUI conference by students who might otherwise be unable to do so for financial reasons. It will enhance the educational experience of funded participants, by bringing them into contact with leading researchers in the field and by exposing them to the lively discussion during the course of the conference that often leads to opportunities for career advancement. The quality of the conference itself will be enhanced as well, thanks to a broadening of the base of institutions represented and increased diversity of participants. The rich exchange of ideas at IUI has previously proven to be a valuable source of ideas for future research, as well as leading to collaborative efforts; this funding will extend the opportunities for collaboration and provide intellectual stimulus to programs that have previously sent few or no representatives to this conference. The organizing committee has undertaken to proactively recruit student participants from schools that have not traditionally been well represented in the IUI community. Women, minority students, the disabled, and veterans all will be encouraged to participate. To further assure diversity, no more than one student will be accepted from any given institution.","title":"WORKSHOP: Student Consortium at the 2014 ACM Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces","awardID":"1415879","effectiveDate":"2013-12-15","expirationDate":"2015-02-28","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":[565127],"PO":["565227"]},"211006":{"abstract":"With the advent of Internet, numerous applications in the context of network traffic, search, and databases are faced with very large, inherently high-dimensional, or naturally streaming datasets. To effectively tackle these extremely large-scale practical problems (e.g., building statistical models from massive data, real-time network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection), methods based on statistics and probability have become increasingly popular. This proposal aims at developing theoretical, well-grounded statistical methods for massive data based on random projections, including data stream algorithms, quantized projection algorithms, and sparse projection algorithms.<br\/><br\/>Massive data are often generated as high-rate streams. Network traffic is a typical example. Effective measurements (and updates) of network traffic in real-time using small storage space are crucial for detecting anomaly events, for example the DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. For many applications such as databases and machine learning, appropriate quantization of random projections will substantially improve the accuracies (in terms of variance per bit) and provide efficient indexing and dimension reductions to facilitate efficient search and learning. The proposed research will tackle a series of mathematically challenging problems in the development of random projections. A wide range of statistical learning and numerical linear algebra algorithms will be re-engineered to take advantage of the state-the-art projection methods.<br\/><br\/>These days, many industries such as search are in urgent demand for statistical algorithms which can effectively handle massive data. It is expected that algorithms to be developed in this proposal will be integrated with parallel platforms, to solve truly large-scale real-world problems. Research results will be disseminated to practitioners through publications, conference presentations, industry visits and collaborations, tutorials, and open-source distributions. Many of the proposed research problems involve statistical analysis and may continue to help attract statisticians\/mathematicians to work on area of big data. The proposed research activities will engage both undergraduate and graduate students in statistics and engineering, through innovative curriculum and research training.","title":"BIGDATA: Small: DA: A Random Projection Approach","awardID":"1419210","effectiveDate":"2013-12-01","expirationDate":"2016-04-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8083","name":"Big Data Science &Engineering"}}],"PIcoPI":[565250],"PO":[565251]},"210974":{"abstract":"With the proliferated growth of wireless communication services, the radio spectrum has become a precious resource.

Short papers on the participants' work will be published in the conference proceedings, and a summary report on the event will be posted on the conference website. <br\/><br\/>Broader Impacts: The PETRA 2014 Doctoral Consortium will bring together some of the best students, researchers and practitioners in relevant fields, and will thereby afford the younger participants a unique opportunity to gain wider exposure for their innovative ideas while also receiving reinforcement for the importance and value of conducting research with societal impact. The workshop will allow the junior participants to create a social network both among themselves and with senior colleagues. The organizing committee will make a concerted effort to attract participants who are women, members of under-represented minorities, and persons with disabilities. To further assure diversity, NSF funds will be used to support no more than 2 student participants from any one institution. And this year, for the first time, NSF funds will also be used to support attendance at the conference of 2 select undergraduate students, in the hope of exciting them about possible career choices in science.","title":"WORKSHOP: Doctoral Consortium at the PETRA 2014 Conference","awardID":"1409897","effectiveDate":"2013-12-15","expirationDate":"2014-11-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"7367","name":"HUMAN-CENTERED COMPUTING"}}],"PIcoPI":["229551",564932],"PO":["565227"]},"210945":{"abstract":"This proposal provides travel support for the 2013 Energy CPS workshop, covering speakers, breakout session moderators, and scribes important to the workshop's overall success.

Virtual reality (VR) is a multidisciplinary field involving human-centered computer simulations that seek to imitate or augment real world senses (usually sight, sound, and touch) and experiences. VR research includes developing and assessing methods and systems, and facilitating and understanding user perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors. First organized by the IEEE Computer Society in 1993 and held annually since 1995, IEEE Virtual Reality is the premier international conference and exhibition in this field and includes technical paper presentations, workshops, tutorials, research demonstrations, and exhibits from industry. The IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces has been held annually and colocated with IEEE VR since 2006. Based on prior year numbers, the combined 2014 conferences are expected to attract 350-400 registrants, 15-20 exhibitors, and 30 student volunteers.

The main activities of the DC will take place on Sunday, March 30, immediately prior to the start of the IEEE VR conference proper and in parallel with the second day of the IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces; additional smaller activities will take place at scattered times over the rest of the week. The workshop will include morning and afternoon sessions in which each student presents his\/her work to the other student participants and a panel of senior VR researchers, with sufficient time set aside after each talk for discussion and constructive feedback that addresses the strengths of the work, challenges and issues that may arise, and implications of the results. A group working lunch attended by all the students and mentors will be particularly valuable for unifying the individual goals and projects presented within the group as part of a \"big picture\" envisioning of the future of the field over the next 10-20 years.

Current sensors observing the space weather environment are sparsely deployed and relatively costly to operate. A promising technique to overcome this issue leverages existing Global Positioning System (GPS) infrastructure; more specifically, delays in the multi-frequency GPS signals observed at the ground that are caused by ionospheric electron density. Modern mobile devices constitute a vast network of multicore parallel computers that provide the computational power needed for geospace data processing and storage. With connectivity available worldwide, even in remote places, mobile devices are thus excellent candidates to establish global relays that feed sensor data into a cloud processing environment that reconstructs the structure of the space environment, and its dynamic changes. This project will enable space weather data collection even in the most remote places on Earth, resulting in dramatic improvements in observational gaps that exist in space weather research today. Kila Mahali means \"everywhere\" in the Swahili language. Space weather phenomena in Earth's upper atmosphere influence our daily lives, but prior technical limitations have made a thorough understanding of these phenomena difficult. In today's networked society, it is critical to monitor and predict extreme space weather events and their impacts on the ionosphere, because they can affect human systems for power, communications, and navigation. Recent studies have also demonstrated that tsunamis and earthquakes perturb the density of electrons in the ionosphere, and that even climate change has a measurable impact on ionospheric electron density. This interdisciplinary project explores how to make this possible by leveraging mobile devices as enabling relays for a dense mesh of measurements. This approach will create totally new opportunities for Space Weather monitoring, scientific investigation, and potentially use of the entire ionosphere as a sensor to monitor natural disasters and help save human lives.","title":"INSPIRE Track 1: Mahali: Space Weather Monitoring Everywhere","awardID":"1343967","effectiveDate":"2013-12-01","expirationDate":"2016-11-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"04","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR SOCIAL, BEHAV & ECONOMIC SCIE","abbr":"SBE"},"div":{"id":"0405","name":"Division of OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCE","abbr":"SES"},"pgm":{"id":"8078","name":"INSPIRE"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0505","name":"Division of COMPUTER AND NETWORK SYSTEMS","abbr":"CNS"},"pgm":{"id":"7363","name":"RES IN NETWORKING TECH & SYS"}},{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0506","name":"Division of EXPERIMENTAL & INTEG ACTIVIT","abbr":"EIA"},"pgm":{"id":"1714","name":"SPECIAL PROJECTS - CISE"}}],"PIcoPI":[560571,560572,560573,560574,560575],"PO":["564736"]},"209264":{"abstract":"The goal of this project is to develop a fully-passive intra cranial sensing system.

This demands creative uses of the underlying technical capabilities (i.e., passive data capture, data analysis and machine learning, data visualization, user experience), as well as rigorous understanding of the underlying health condition and management (i.e. functional health measures, achievable and optimal health outcomes, patient challenges in adherence, risks and benefits associated with medication and other aspects of treatment, and clinical decision making). The approach has broad applicability across disease management (e.g., auto-immune, gastrointestinal, depression, cognitive decline, and neurologic disorders), but also calls for tailoring to specific conditions and individuals. Therefore, we will conduct this initial work in a specific context, that of chronic pain management for three prominent conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and lower back pain. The behavioral biomarkers associated with our initial target domain, pain management, center around: (i) decline in activity levels; (ii) increase in stress; (iii) decrease in sleep quality; (iv) drop in function, e.g., reduction in travel distance or inability to go to work. The effectiveness of passive sensing capabilities of the mobile phone to track sleep, changes in activity level, stress, social isolation, geographic location and several other indicators that are likely antecedents or symptoms of pain interference has been demonstrated previously. <br\/><br\/>While behavioral biomarkers rely extensively on passively captured data streams (such as activity, location, communication, application usage and audio), there remain important cases in which self-report data is required to augment or clarify passively collected data. However, the standardized patient survey instruments that assess relevant symptoms and behavior are not suitable for use on a daily basis because of length, question design, or both. Further, traditional forms of self report are often intrusive, burdensome, and suffer high rates of attrition. A new approach, contextual recall, aims to mitigate the issues related to self-report through three key mechanisms: optimizing the delivery of prompts, providing the user with key contextual cues to improve recall, and employing visual input techniques as an alternative to long-form measures that do not scale well to frequent mobile self-reports. The approach to personalizing disease management is intentionally scalable in terms of affordability and accessibility. Passive data collection requires no user attention, and contextual recall is a form of self-report designed for busy individuals with a range of demands and constraints on their time, as well as potential literacy and numeracy constraints. The clinician-facing components of this approach are also designed to work in resource-constrained clinical settings where clinicians are under particular time pressure. The team will recruit patients and clinicians from typically underserved communities to engage in the participatory design process. The overall contributions of this work will include development and evaluation of: (1) software techniques to combine and transform passively monitored and self-reported data streams into clinically meaningful, actionable, and personalized indicators, which we call behavioral biomarkers; (2) contextual recall that allows the collection of highly granular and contextually specific self-report data to enhance passively captured data with information from the patient perspective, while balancing the tension faced in balancing recall bias and usability; and (3) a methodology that systematizes the collaboration with clinical domain experts to develop and integrate behavioral biomarkers into clinical decision making for specific diseases. We will create and evaluate a modular and extensible suite of analytics and user interaction techniques designed to facilitate iterative implementation and evaluation. These modules will themselves be a contribution, but","title":"SCH: INT: Novel Techniques for Patient-centric Disease Management using Automatically Inferred Behavioral Biomarkers and Sensor-Supported Contextual Self-Report","awardID":"1344587","effectiveDate":"2013-12-01","expirationDate":"2017-11-30","fundingAgent":[{"dir":{"id":"05","name":"Directorate for DIRECT FOR COMPUTER & INFO SCIE & ENGINR","abbr":"CSE"},"div":{"id":"0502","name":"Division of INFORMATION & INTELLIGENT SYST","abbr":"IIS"},"pgm":{"id":"8018","name":"Smart Health & Wellbeing"}}],"PIcoPI":[560926,560927,560928,560929,560930],"PO":["565136"]},"210261":{"abstract":"The Third Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) will take place as part of the flagship programming language conference, Principles of Programming Languages (POPL 2013), which is being held in San Diego California.
